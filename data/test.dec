Eber's Deep Conditioner every two days. And I never, ever use a blowdryer without the diffuser attachment.
I was?
No...
Like my fear of wearing pastels?
No
I hope so.
They do not!
I don't have to be home 'til two.
I did.
Hopefully.
Queen Harry?
My agent says I've got a good shot at being the Prada guy next year.
Can you at least start wearing a bra?
At least I'm not a clouted fen- sucked hedge-pig.
You're welcome.
You set me up.
No! You're not dating until your sister starts dating.  End of discussion.
Daddy, no!
You're not going unless your sister goes.  End of story.
North, actually.  How'd you   ?
Thirty-two.
Joey Dorsey?  Perma-shit-grin.  I wish I could say he's a moron, but he's number twelve in the class.  And a model.  Mostly regional stuff, but he's rumored to have a big tube sock ad coming out.
You mean I'd get a chance to talk to her?
I thought you hated those people.
Hell, I've just been going over the whole thing in my head and -
So what does that give me?  I'm supposed to buy her some noodles and a book and sit around listening to chicks who can't play their instruments?
I don ' t know.  I decided not to nail her when she was too drunk to remember it.
Not at all
How much?
What?
Forget it.
A deal's a deal.
Enough with the Barbie n' Ken shit. I know.
Does this conversation have a purpose?
Hey -- it's all for the higher good right?
Does it matter?
No fear.
Who cares?
I got drunk.  I puked.  I got rejected. It was big fun.
Oh, good.  Something new and different for us.
Oh, honey -- tell me we haven't' progressed to full-on hallucinations.
My mission in life.
I don't really think you warrant that strong an emotion.
And why would I do that?
Depends on the topic. My fenders don't really whip me into a verbal frenzy.
You know who The Raincoats are?
I know, just let me sleep
Because then I'd have to start taking out girls who like me.
See that?  Who needs affection when I've got blind hatred?
BIANCA
What are you doing here?
Other than my upchuck reflex? Nothing.
So how'd you get Chapin to look the other way?
Acting the way we do.
Fallacy.
I hate peas.
No one else knows
Why not?
It's Scurvy's.  His date got convicted. Where'd you get the dress?
Because I like to torture you.
I thought we decided you were going to school here.  At U of 0.
No, Daddy.
The part where Bianca beat the hell out of some guy.
Just smack her now.
Yeah.  I guess.
Yeah...
Dorsey can plow whoever he wants. I'm just in this for the cash.
Touch of the flu.
Make anyone cry today?
Pirate -- no question.
Kissing?  Is that what you think happens?  Kissing isn't what keeps me up to my elbows in placenta all day.
But -- who -- what --?
Absolutely not.
Did He not choose a carpenter's son to reveal Himself to the world?
IF-GOD-WILLS-IT!
The Judgment is ours!
Indeed.  The world is full of mercenaries -- and states often make use of them, when it benefits them.  My only concern is the welfare and prosperity of Spain.
Thank God...
I am busy inside.
Bartolome and Giacomo Colon.
Appointment to what?
I am afraid this is not the worst news.
He asks when he can come to visit you.  He left his address.
What is it?  A tribe?  An island?
Tell the Chief we thank him.
Thousands.
Father, I am doing what I think is the best for him.  And he has the teacher I would have chosen for myself.
With some difficulty.  I had to promise them you were not a total fool.
I've been contradicted all my life... Eternity!
Damn God!
Damn all of you!  You all set up theories based on what?  You never leave the safety of your studies! Go out!  Find out what the world is about and then tell me something I can listen to!
I am not sure... It could be twice the distance.
You are bound by an oath, Father.
You'll always be older than me, Father.
Oh?  So you are a new man?
You show no inclination to speak otherwise!
A woman?
Thirty seven, Your Majesty... And you?
If you want to keep your head on your shoulders, you'll do as I say.
Savagery is what monkeys understand.
Immediately.
We have to keep the hopes of these men alive!
Pinzon, Pinzon... All we can do now is go forward!  Think about that!
Yes, Your Majesty.
Is this true, Brother Buyl?
Where are we going?
You bring the cigarettes?
What about Oleg?
No.  No way.
Your father put cigarettes out on you?
Yes, I considered it.
So you were never a prostitute?
They're not gonna send you right back.
C'mon, start at the beginning.  You know these people?
Go on.
What do you mean, 'cleaned up?'
What was I supposed to do?  The guy tried to mug me.  I was gonna send a cop back - I just forgot.
Yeah.
When?
You ready?
Yeah.
We don't have her I.D. yet, but one of your girls was killed last night at the King Edward Hotel.
What are you saying?
Pretty.
I'm on duty.
What would your girlfriend think of that?
What do you want?
If you kill me and film it you're putting a noose around your neck.
Smarter than Americans.  You're fed cry baby talk shows all day long.  Not only will Americans believe me, they'll cry for me.  So...Detective Eddie Flemming, would you like to say goodbye to your Nicolette? Maybe you can propose to her now?
I can't talk right now.  We have some things to take care of.
He was hurt, but not seriously.  He'll be fine.
Alright?
You were merciless.  You didn't give a shit if you got me or not.
Yeah.  I promise.
My kids?  Let's see...Susan's 15. Aundrea's 9.  Don't tell me you're thinking about having a kid!  How old are you?  Never mind. Let me just tell you this: Every stupid cliche you hear about kids - they change your life, they make you a better person, they make you whole...  It's all true!  Before I had kids when friends talked about their kids, I wanted to vomit.  Now -- I get it.  Am I right, Leon?
You're worried for my safety.  I'm touched.
I am butcher.
Dog food.
Where is escort service?
I have five-hundred dollars.
I'd like to speak for himself, okay?
Million?!  The killer gets one million dollars for a television interview?
Okay.
Because I don't like your ugly language. I heard enough of it in school!  Now speak Czech or English.  And don't fool around anymore.  You almost got us thrown out!
I'll do it.  Don't hurt my camera!
I'm homesick.  You have Eastern European girl?  A Czech girl?
Whatever we do - we fuck her, right?
And the whore's murder?  You didn't erase that either, did you?  Don't lie, I won't be angry.
Bad last moment - I cut it out.
Credit?
Did you hurt her?
As a plumber?!
What are you doing here?
Then answer my questions.  Where were you planning to stay during the two weeks that you're here?
Movies...to be in the movies or to see movies?
Yeah, well, some people got their priorities straight.
Evidence.  Of a homicide.
No way!  He's mine!
Fire Department?  Firemen don't carry guns.
Hey, by the way, I'm really sorry about your wife leavin' you.
Clean?
He knew all along.
How long they been livin' here?
Not good.
You seem very savvy for a man who's been found mentally incompetent to stand trial.
But doesn't the Son of Sam Law prevent criminals from profiting from their crimes?
I'm sorry, Dr. Smyslov, but I'm really not at liberty to discuss this.
Okay, come on down.
Yes.
It's possible.
I don't think we should make any fuss about it yet. I'm sure they'll straighten it out.
Of course, it would be very easy for us to find out now.
But not completely inconceivable?
Yes, but it's more likely that the tolerances on our testing gear are too low.
Yes.
Well, now that we've got one that's actually failed, we should be able to figure out what's happened and fix it.
I guess you don't know your own strength, old boy.
I think I'll have to go out and burn them off.
The antenna has to be replaced.
Hal, I'm in command of this ship. I order you to release the manual hibernation control.
Yes, I remember you mentioning it. I got mine about the same time.
Did they have any explanation for this?
Well, the only important aspect of the mission are: where are we going, what will we do when we get there, when are we coming back, and... why are we going?
Yes, I know that sweetheart.
No, I'm sorry, darling, I told you I won't be home for a few days.
Mommy's out to the hair- dresser.
Yes, Daddy.
Goodbye, Daddy.
Please, it really doesn't matter.
Yes. Well, for one thing, whenever you phone the base, all you can get is a recording which repeats that the phone lines are temporarily out of order.
Tomb, shine, survey-marker spare part, take your choice.
Approximately five years after we go into hibernation, the recovery vehicle will make rendezous with us and bring us back. Is this true?
Thank you very much, Hal.
Hal, maintain normal E.V.A. condition.
Hal, check all airlock doors secure.
Opening pod bay doors.
Not really, Frank. I think there may be a flaw in the assembly procedure.
Hammond.
Great, just great.
Fuck off.  I don't know what the hell you're talkin' about.
Whaddya mean, buy?
He's just kiddin', you just keep doin' what I tell ya, you'll be okay.
Oh ... You're a schoolteacher...
Would you guys...
Yeah.  Sure, i'm crazy in love with him, who wouldn't be...
You got a girl... shit... the generosityof women never ceases to amaze me.
You just don't get it, do your Reggie?  There isn't any deal. I own your ass.
Get this.  We ain't partners. We ain't brothers.  We ain't friends. I'm puttin' you down and keepin' you down until Ganz is locked up or dead.  And if Ganz gets away, you're gonna be sorry we ever met.
Don't worry, I got a move for ya. An awesome move. A guy named Luther. Ganz'll be paying him a visit.  We go to him right away.
Just an expression man, don't mean nothin'.
Your pal nuts enough to take a shot at me?
Just get in the car and keep your mouth shut.
I got two problems.  Number one, I'm not playin' games.  Number two, you got nothin' to bet with.
What are you talkin' about?
I don't know what you're talking about. I just wanna see Ganz nailed.
My kind of place. I always liked country boys.
Naw, you'd just call your pals back to bail you out one more time.
Jesus.
Not likely, convict.
In the trunk of a car.  A lot better than under a mattress, right?
I let women get to me.  The quest for pussy is the meaning of life ... I got my own personal philosophy about 'em.  Keep women separate from guns, money and business ... women are for spending money.  They got nothing to do with helping you make it.
I'm not in this 'cause it's fun. I'm not into hitting guys 'cause it makes me feel good either... I do it 'cause it works-...
Right. if you ever switch from armed robbery to pimping, then you're all set.
What about Ganz?
I can just take her right across the street to Luther's hotel.  All I need is some money for the room.
Yeah. It missed the last four stops.
I had it impounded.  Come on, we'll use it for haulin' you back to the slam.
Don't worry about it.
Whatever play I maker just back me up.
Sure, I'll give you a shot at it, but Ganz is mine.  You know, that big Indian plays it for keeps...
Partnership?
Yeah.  But I wasn't there for a second.
They ran.  As fast as they could. Caught a train.
I didn't have the time.
The truth hurts, doesn't it, buddy?
Backup man from the East Bay. Worked with Ganz a few years ago and sprung him from the road gang.
Uhh ... Wong, Henry Wong.  He was in on the same job.
So do you...been a long day.
I'm not paid to take your personal calls.  He was in some bar. .. off duty.
I think I met her.  Now tell us something we don't know, like where they stashed her.
When? How?
I guess he got the message...
That's right.  I'm not like you. I'm not gonna sit on my ass wondering what's right and what's wrong... There's a psycho out there killing people with my gun and I'm gonna get him.  Because it's my job. And if you don't get that...
Elaine! I... I'm sorry... I was expecting somebody else... police business.
Jack?  What was that?
Jack, it's all over the papers. He's an obvious type.  But this Indian...
Usual bullshit.  You make one smart move and everybody wants to be your friend... You know somethin', shootin' guys sucks. Especially compared to this.
Shut up.
Yeah, old times.
Whaddya want?  I thought you were locked up-
First, the money.
Naw, right here's okay.
I'm fucked!
...I'm a priest! I'm here to serve life, All you want to do is destroy it.
Destroying a glass is one thing..killing people with the weapons you produce is quite another.
I know...
Weddings are one floor down. Congratulations.
So you do know her.
Dallas. Korben Dallas.
Father, I was in the Army for awhile and every time they told us we were on a mission to save the world the only thing that changed was I lost a lot of friends. So thanks for the offer.. but no thanks.
Trying to save your ass so you can save the world.
Theoretically, yes! The four Stones form the beam and the Fifth Element is supposed to stand in the middle there, but... I don't have the reference book. I've never seen the Stones work!
That's what I'm saying.
And then?
Yes..thank God..
Absolutely sure There's the triple suns on her gloves!
Perfect.
Good work, my son.  Now all we need is a way to get there.
On the plane... with Mr. Dallas... the real one.
Later, David! Later! There's not a minute to lose!
So, just how big was this fare?
...'Scuse me?
It there's one thing I don't need advice on, it's how to drive.
...Leeloo.
You're the nastiest dirtbag I know in this stinking City!
...And now you're making fun of me? I'm warning you! If you don't take me after all these years of sacrifice, I'll never forgive you!!
I get it! You want to make me beg, is that it?
Don't you ever ask me for another thing in my life again, you've killed your poor mother with your own hands!
Anyone know how to release the lines on this crate?
Uh... not really.
Crystal.
Got it...
Why not?
What is it?
Uh..you're welcome.
Took the words right out of my mouth. Go on... I'll be right with you.  It's our honeymoon. We're going to use the trip to get to know each other better.
Not hard to find you...just follow the Chaos...
Yes! But "love" isn't the operative word here, PEACE is!
Learning language.
Good! Do you know how we say "make love"?
OK, you can turn around!
The words you're looking for weren't in the dictionary you studied. I won't be long.
I told you not to read all that crap!
The wind blows... the fire burns...
I'm so tired...
I've never gotten a message that wasn't bad news.
Actually only one cell survived..
This cell is like a huge library. It has infinite genetic knowledge stored inside. Almost like it was...engineered.
Wonderful!
I'm about to, Mr. President.
"..in which all the history of the Universe resides ..all the strength..all the hope..Protect us from Evil.."
To fame.. salud..
Got it.
We've been all through that.  I've been on my best behavior.
What's wrong?  Are you alright?
I don't know what to say
Amy...
What you see is what I got, mister.
Because somebody just fucking called me and fucking laid it out!
What can I do for you today?
Hmm.
I'll consider it.
What are you... ?
I remember him.
Call me Tom.
Why not go to the N.C.I.C. or N.C.M.E.C.?
Why don't they come to me?
I'm not so sure about this.
Any good?
You're gonna be seeing a lot of me. You're sure you don't mind?
I know what you did.
You killed that girl and you put it on film.  You and your pals, you're fucked.  You fucked up real good.
What the fuck do you want from me?
Show me where you buried her.
Get together some upscale product where the girls still have teeth in their head.  Till then, fuck you.
Wouldn't exactly have been possible for a man of his stature.
That's trust.  Mr. Christian trusted me implicitly.
I was well compensated.
Never mind how I found you.
Shut your mouth and drive!
I'm asking.
Why did he buy a film of some poor, lost girl getting butchered?
Go ahead, shoot me.  Then try driving to Brooklyn with my brains all over the windshield.
I'll risk it.
Interesting theory.
Child pornography.
Snuff films.
You want me to come out there and play private eye?
It's their Presidential Suite.
Who is this, in the mask?  Who is he?
Thank you.
I've been privileged to provide services for people I admire.
My condolences.
Mostly.  That's where he started his empire building.  He was a good man.  Notorious as an eccentric, but that was something he cultivated.  He wanted to be legendary.
You hired someone to open it.  I'll bet the lawyer loved that.
No.  For me to live with the ruin of my husband's name, I need know that whoever did this will be punished. If you can find them, I will take their names to the police.  I'll say my husband confessed on his death bed. I'll say I didn't have courage to come forward at first...
I know what I'm asking.  Your compensation will be appropriate to the risk.  You'll need cash to buy information, and I'll provide it.  I feel responsible, Mr. Welles.  You saw what he did to her.
I hope it's nothing serious.
There wasn't anything like that. The police and the FBI people asked, but there wasn't anything happened like that, never.  My husband... his heart broke when Mary left...
Okay.
Will you let me look?
You're probably right, and I probably won't find anything. I don't have a right to ask this, and you can kick me out of your house if you want, but this is my profession and there's a part of me that can't let it go.  Police are just as human as you or I.  They could have missed something.  They probably didn't.  Wouldn't you rather know?
Mrs. Mathews?  It's Thomas.  Do you remember, I was there a few weeks ago... asking about your daughter...
I have to tell you something.  It won't be easy for you to hear.  It's about your daughter... Mary Anne...  When I... when I was there with you, her diary, in your attic, in silverware.  If you read it, you'll know what I'm telling you is true...
Who is this... ?
That's her suitcase.  I had forgotten it, till you showed me her picture.
None too discreet, is he?
He's an imbecile.  I tried to warn my daughter, but what can you do?
Excellent.  we accept MasterCard and American Express.
I don't want to.
Kristen...
When I used to have nightmares.  I brought my friends in to help me.  Until they all started dying.
You're his sister, right?
Tell him I was looking for him, okay?  I'm Dan.
Kristen was the last child left of the people who killed Freddy.  Maybe Freddy can't get to new kids without someone like me.  Someone to bring them to him.
Why can't we just talk to the authorities?
Hey, you're not alone.  We have to stop him, I'm with you.
Oh God!  He killed them!
Yeah.  I guess so... What happened?
What I what?  Well, I've thought about it.  I plan to keep him.
You're not taking my baby!
It's where he hides out.  Inside.  That's how he found me.
He says it's easy.  Especially with sad people.  With closed-off people.
Jesus!  Don't do that!
I watched from behind the stands.  Didn't want to embarrass you, ya know.  "The drunk showed up", that kind of thing...
You sure you don't want a ride to work?
Sobering...
No, I'm not.  I sort of hope it's a boy. Be nice to have a boy playing in the house again.
Yeah, before they revoke his diploma.
When Dan died you weren't even asleep. You said so.  End of story.
Why don't you two stick to reality.
I just can't figure out how he's getting in when I'm awake...
That's the only reason you're alive...
If they actually bothered to bury her.
So did Dan.
That's okay.  He's got the rest of his life to catch up on his sleep.
Yeah.  I'm just aces.
Nobody thinks that.
I'm going to see what else I can find out about Mr. Fred Krueger
That's their problem.
You know my mother -- get real.  What about Alice's?
I want to talk about the baby.
Two hours a day, six days a week.
Faint.
It was supposed to be.  Dad had a heart attack, two days ago.
It was moderate.  He'll be all right.  But it was out of the question, his coming along.
We're <u>all</u> risking our lives!
You mean <u>nothing</u> is worth fighting for?
I guess.
Sounds like it!  Distress call, from a small freighter, between Ellesmere Island and Greenland. One mayday, then...nothing.
Skipper!  Look at the depth gauge!
Go back and tell Dr. Neilsen. Have him report to the Skipper.
Wonderful!
Anything ---
There's got to be an explanation!
Who with?
I have selected you, to return with me - along with several other specimens, for study.  We will examine you and the others, discover desirable features to incorporate in our 'earth-colonizers.'
Toward the Pole!
Been putting my files into it. You take sugar and milk?
Alma, I think there's some dirty business going on in this town.
You know Jack Hewitt, the kid I work with?
He musta found out. They had to get rid of him. And Jack'll get blamed.
Tell me.
How soon?
No, not exactly. I'll look at the divorce decree, see if we can get it redrawn. Interview your daughter. Jill, right?
Not exactly. I mean, he never paid me.
Yep. Right about now the does are holing up in the brush piles. The bucks are right behind them and we're right behind the bucks.  This gun gets fired before ten o'clock. Whether it kills a deer or not is more less up to you. I'll put you inside 30, 35 yards of a buck the first four hours of the season. That's what you're paying me for, ain't it?
Tell you what. You get me close to a big buck by ten, kid, there's another hundred bucks in it.
Yeah.
You think so.
Follow close. We'll cross the next meadow.
Sun's gettin high.
Got you for -- 450, 500 bucks? 
How'd you get the job?
Right. The sonofabitch couldn't get along without me.
The ambulance guys lugged him up.
Yeah.
Musta... How'd I know? What're you doing, playing cop?
Who the fuck knows? Musta slipped or something. I just heard the gun go off.
Break stuff?
It's not funny now. I'm a cop and I gotta listen to all the complaints people make. I'm not a kid anymore. You change.
I called Mommy.
Yes.
See, I knew you'd be mad.
I told her I wanted to come home. Daddy, don't be mad at me.
Yeah. My car's in the shop. This'll be fine.
Grandpa. My father. It's his.
Okay.
Nope. Not anymore. I'm nothing anymore.
Got here just in time. Go ahead. Jump in line. Maybe you'll win a prize.
At the school crossing. In his BMW. Coulda hurt some kids. I'm gonna bust his ass.
What am I -- a security guard? You hired me, you and your Selectman friends.
You mean Twombley?
You want me to follow them to Littleton?
Yeah. A few things.
Elaine! Call Chub Meritt and have him pick up Wade's car, fix the clutch.
Mel's doing some business with me. It's nice to do favors for people you do business with. He was in a hurry. No big deal.
Let the past be.  I'm sorry about your mother. I liked her. You never know how much women like that suffer. It's like they live their lives with the sound turned off -- and then they're gone.
You make me sick. I can't believe you've sunk so low.
You know what I'm talking about. For what you're doing to me and to the child you say you love so much. Love. You won't get away with it.
I know who it is.
From Boston. Evan Twombley's son-in- law -- he was driving. I know where they're headed. Up the lake, Agaway. The old man's out deer hunting with Jack Hewitt, so they probably got some big weekend party planned.
I'm going to start one of those custody suits. I don't give a fucking shit. You know?
The hell she isn't. Lillian's been trying to nail me to a cross since the day I met her. I'm gonna hire me a fucking lawyer from Concord and get this thing, this divorce thing, rearranged. I've been thinking about it a lot. It's like she owns Jill or something. Nobody owns nobody, especially not kids. And I pay her.
There's something funny about that shooting. There's lots funny about it, actually.
I've been wondering if maybe Jack shot Twombley, instead of Twombley shooting himself. I've been wondering maybe Jack shot him on purpose.
The Mafia hire Jack Hewitt?
You knew me as a kid.
What way?
It's nice.
There's another thing I've been thinking about. I don't know how you feel about the idea, Margie, because we've never talked about it. But I've been thinking lately, I've been thinking we should get married sometime. You and me.
How's that?
Not since last night. He took a guy hunting.
It's called a grilled cheese sandwich, you dub.
A lesson in work and its rewards. You'll thank me for this one day.  Sally, turn off that TV!
I checked on her. She had the electric heater. Cold don't bother her as much as me. Which is why I give her the heater.
You don't know me. You don't know me!  So fuck you. Fuck you.
There was something. It happened up your way.
He was scheduled to testify for a committee investigating organized crime in New England and the construction business.
Huh?
What about Jill? Is Lillian bringing her?
Yeah. She'll probably quit her job and stay out here with Pop. We can't leave him alone here, he'll set the damn place on fire. With Jill here a lot, it'll be good to have Margie around. Things are going to change in that department, by the way. I got a custody lawyer in Concord. I'm gonna see him tomorrow. All hell's gonna break loose, but it's worth it.
That it wasn't an accident.
Well, your friend, I think. Jack Hewitt.
Here's my theory. Twombley, unaware of illegal union loans or whatever, starts nosing around cause of the investigation and finds out. Finds out his son-in-law is involved.
Of course it happened. Why would I lie about it?
Wade, are you alright?
Your father never means to be so...
Yes dear?
That's the way of the world, little one. Didn't they teach you that in school?
It was the experience of a lifetime.
Daddy...
Been better, Dad... You?
They are in our airspace. We would be within our rights.
cross it...  The static overwhelms the voice, then cuts out.
You read my mind.
He's busy being dead.
Okay. We're gonna arc a fat one to the right. Got it?
That kid's name was Jim Marshall.
Goddamn right I did.  I asked for a tough-as-nails speech and you gave me diplomatic bullshit.  What's the point in having a speech if I have to ad-lib?
My loyalty was never to my country.
Roger.
Stand by.
Conference rooms, though some have other functions.  The one up front doubles as an emergency medical center.
Maria... Maria Mitchell.
You will be the first to pay for that mistake.
You're very valuable. And our nation needs so many things.
Call up Petrov and order Stravanavitch' S release.
Hold on, Alice.
Gravity.
Eighteen thousand feet, sir. And two hundred knots... otherwise it's suicide.
That isn't necessary.
What?
Shall I ask the Chief of Staff to schedule your daughter in?
Please... don't start with me.
We're under attack.
But...
No. no. no. Wait. Wait.
Iraq? Shep, you're fired.
That just doesn't make any sense.
I was reading too.
Some southern plantation owner falls in love with this poor...
Dunn.
Sir?
Te...!
I have to get in there.  I have to stop this flight.
What word would you use, Elaine?
What would you say if I told you the toilet just blew up in my face.
Ted!
The sun will heat that thing to over 450 degrees within seconds.  He'll roast like a pig on a spit.
Not when I'm with you, Ted.
Kramer, the WORP control handle just came off in my hand.
The human brain is a highly complex organ, Elaine, perhaps the most complex next to the bladder.  Let me show you.  Ted's problem is in this area.  This area, this area, here, here, here, under here, here...
Negative.
That's okay, ROK.
Life support check.  Elaine, it's obvious you've been ignoring me.  You're a woman. I can relate to that.
I bet Scraps is going to love Mercury.
No more kids yelling, 'Your old man's a thieving rapist'?
All right.  Here.
Have you tried it with a little cinnamon?
Mr. Kurtz, I presume.
Do you have an appointment, sir?
Don't try to stop me!
Kurtz, you're drunk.  Who's in command of this ship?
Not Dr. Barrington, the world renowned agronomist?
I just wish it was that simple.  We really were in love.  You know how it is when you laugh all the time.
Thank you. Cream?
Mine's Eleanor. Eleanor Schiff.
No. I'm all alone.
Shep, no! I'll bet you have exciting things happen all the time down there.
Surely there must be something you can do.
And the last thing he said to me, "Doc," he said, "Sometime when the crew is up against it and the breaks are beating the boys, tell them to go out there with all they've got and win just one for the Zipper. I don't know where I'll be then, Doc," he said, "but I won't smell too good. That's for sure."
No, I mean we can't <u>land</u> for another two hours. Fog has closed down everything this side of the mountains. We've got to go through to Chicago!
I'm not sure. I haven't seen anything like this since the Lina Wertmuller Film Festival.
It takes so many things to make love last. Most of all it takes respect. And I can't live with a man I don't respect!
And a little ice.
It's a damn good thing you don't know how much he hates your guts.
Uh-huh.
Joey can stay up here for a while if he'd like to.
Who wants to be first?
You promise you'll write.
Bill! Bill! Good-bye, Bill.
Yes, Captain?
I think you should go back to your seat now, Joey. Right, Clarence?
...and that lots of times you don't even run down court.
Huh?
Roger, Roger. What's our vector, Victor?
Yes?
Oh -- I haven't flown for a long time.
The cockpit? What is it?
The girl out front mentioned Strader's assistant, somebody named Watson.  Maybe he knows.
Not unless I got real drunk and nobody told me about it later.
Ss'ai k'ss?  Perfect.
Show me.
Nothing.
We'd like to ask you about a business associate of your, Warren Hubley.
At the end of the bar.
Screw me?  That can't be right.
I appreciate your honesty, George.
George, she's not gonna divorce you. You mate for life, remember?
Like your cocaine, I suppose.  The "high" lasts several hours.  We would receive small amounts of it... as a reward for our labor.
Where is the drug?  Where have they taken it?
The fifty kilos, Matthew.  I have to find it.  I can't let it get out on the street.
It'd be for your own good.  I think you'd be better off with a partner who's a little more... by the book.  ... Still, I gotta tell you, George, for a quiet guy, you're sure hell on wheels once you get going.  I'd kinda hate to miss your next two days as a detective.
No he's not.  Not if he overdosed on the drug.  Massive amounts trigger a... a change.  Your body functions seize up, you appear to be dead, but it's really a state of incubation.  When you emerge you're...
Because... because of what will happen if humans see what we are capable of becoming.
You understand that.  But how many others will?
No... two.
Ss'kya'ta'.
Yeah.
Captain.  I'd like to volunteer for duty with the new detective.
Hey, look -- we've known Kristin since... since she was conceived in that cabin up in Big Bear. Remember?  You and Edie banged the wall so hard, me and Carol were picking plaster out of our hair for a week...
But you're bummed because your ex and her new husband are paying for the whole thing.
Whatever gave you that idea?
Position?
Vasquez, take point.  Let's move.
Now let me get this straight. The aliens paralyzed the colonists, carried them over there, cocooned them to be hosts for more of those...
That is the question of the hour.  We could assume a parallel to certain insect forms who have hivelike organization. An ant of termite colony, for example, is ruled by a single female, a queen, which is the source of new eggs.
Just tell them what happened.  The important thing is to stay cool and unemotional.
They had their minds made up before I even went in there. They think I'm a head case.
I suggest you study the disks Ripley has been kind enough to prepare for you.
Sorry to disappoint you.
It's insured.
They're but off!  Do something!
Hudson, Sir.  He's Hicks.
Not that tunnel, the other one!
Are you finished?  You okay?
Do it!
Poor bastard.
Well, that's the grenade launcher ...you probably don't want to mess with that.
Let's waste him.  No offense.
Don't be long, Ellen.
No.  Have you?
Look, man, let's just bug out and call it even, okay?
She survived longer than that with no weapons and no training.
Just get back here!
Yeah.  What?
Christ.  Some honch in a cushy office on Earth says go look at a grid reference in the middle of nowhere, we look.  They don't say why, and I don't ask.  I don't ask because it takes two weeks to get an answer out here and the answer's always 'don't ask.'
How long have I been on Gateway station?
They're dead.
The 'maze'?  You mean the air ducts?
Isn't that how babies come? I mean people babies...they grow inside you?
Look!
A brothel.
A Turkish brothel.
Looks and talent don't always go together, Katherina.
Extremely clever.
Is her mother still lying on the floor?
I'm so relieved.
Sir -
Yes, sir, that's the truth. But don't blame him. The fault is mine. I was too indulgent with him. But not again. Never again, I promise! I implore you - let me bring him back here. I'll make him give his word to serve you faithfully.
Oh, sir, he's never disobeyed me in anything. Please, Your Grace, give him one more chance.
Why do I have to be humiliated in front of my guests by one of my own servants?
I wish you to return immediately to Salzburg. Your father is waiting for you there patiently. I will speak to you further when I come.
Then try harder, Mozart. I have no intention of dismissing you. You will remain in my service and learn your place. Go now.
I feel wrong. I feel wrong being here.
I am! I am! I'm stopping it - slowly. You see! Look, I've stopped. Now we are going back.
We are in the Residence of the Fartsbishop of Salzburg.
No, this is serious. Say it backwards.
Ui-vol-i-tub!
Tea? Who wants tea? Let's go out! This calls for a feast. You don't want tea, Papa. Let's go dancing. Papa loves parties, don't you?
What does she want?
Stanzi!
Wolfi! Your father is dead.
I'm talking about now. How much will you give him now? Down payment?
Why not? Half the house!
It's killing me.
Please! Let me sit here. Let me stay here with you. I promise I won't say all word. I'll just be here, so you know no one's going to hurt you. Please, please!
Would it be too much trouble, sir, to ask you to look at them now? While I wait.
My husband is a proud man, sir. He would be furious if he knew I'd come.
No, sir. This is my own idea.
Oh, thank you, sir!
Tonight?
What?
He needs me, ma'am.
Ah. Well. Ah,  I see you've got your manager with you. Well, Madame, how about half the receipts?
He's not in. But he's working on it. He said to tell you.
So you are! The place is a pigsty all the time.
Adorable!
People who know say the girl's got talent. You must judge for yourself. If you think she stinks, say so.
Ah, now! Here she comes.
Ah-ha!
I'm thinking about Herr Mozart. What is your view?
You please me, Court Composer. A very clever idea.
Yes?
It is not a question of liking, Your Majesty. Your own law decrees it, I'm afraid.
Really? Oh, grazie, Signore! Sono commosso! E un onore per mo eccezionale. Compositore brilliante e famossissimo!
Did we vote in the end for German or Italian?
In a Pasha's Harem, Majesty. A Seraglio.
Yes, indeed.
My dear fellow, there are in fact only so many notes the ear can hear in the course of an evening. I think I'm right in saying that, aren't I, Court Composer?
What is it?
Yes, Sire.
Who told you this, Majesty?
Sire, I swear to Your Majesty, there's nothing like that in the story. I have taken out everything that could give offense. I hate politics.
Ah, love again.
In my opinion, it is time we had a piece in our own language, sir. Plain German. For plain people.
He's here.
It's a secret.
I want you to come back with me to Salzburg, my son.
Good morning, sir.
Do any pupils come to the house?
I'm leaving. I'm not working there anymore. I'm scared!
I don't know. He has pains.
Here, in his stomach. They bend him right over.
I'm frightened, sir. Really! When he speaks, he doesn't make any sense. You know he said he saw - he said he saw his father. And his father's dead.
Are you Herr Mozart?
They'll be paid for by a great admirer or yours who wishes to remain anon - anonymous.
Yes. I can live in or out just as you wish.
Yes, well, it's all good fun.
Oh! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! What have you got for me? Is it finished?
Is my pupil still anxious to learn the art of music?
No doubt, sir. But I am endowed with talent, and you with money. If I offer mine, you should offer yours.
Cream cheese mixed with granulated sugar and suffused with rum. Crema al Mascarpone.
I don't think you should become known in Vienna as a debtor, Mozart. However, I know a very distinguished gentleman I could recommend to you. And he has a daughter. Will that do?
Oh, I could kill him! I mean really kill him. I actually threw the entire opera on the fire, he made me so angry!
I know; it's outrageous. Still, if the public doesn't like one's work one has to accept the fact gracefully.
How could I not?
Oh no! One hears such sounds and what can one say, but - Salieri!
Work fast. And be sure to tell no one what you do. You will see me again soon.
I mean to come to my opera. You are the only colleague who did.
This is only a vaudeville.
Finish what?
Yes. Can I - could I help you, in any way?
I think so.
Sopranos up to F on the second 'Voca'?
What for?
Exactly.
Well not especially. It can be in Turkish, if you really want. I don't care.
But, Your Majesty -
Just let me tell you how it begins.
Certainly, Herr Director.
Oh yes, certainly. Certainly, Herr Director!
Kapellmeister Bonno, Count Orsini- Rosenberg and Court Composer Salieri.
May I just do that, Majesty? Show you how it begins? Just that?
I cannot leave alone a soul in pain.
I regret it is not too familiar.
He was murdered, Father! Mozart! Cruelly murdered.
You cannot say that!
My son, no one can speak for God.
I do not claim to unravel the mysteries. I treasure them. As you should.
No, Father. From now on no one will be able to speak of Mozart without thinking of me. Whenever they say Mozart with love, they'll have to say Salieri with loathing. And that's my immortality - at last! Our names will  be tied together for eternity - his in fame and mine in infamy. At least it's better than the total oblivion he'd planned for me, your merciful God!
Don't pity me. Pity yourself. You serve a wicked God. He killed Mozart, not I. Took him, snatched him away, without pity. He destroyed His beloved rather than let a mediocrity like me get the smallest share in his glory. He doesn't care. Understand that. God cares nothing for the man He denies and nothing either for the man He uses. He broke Mozart in half when He'd finished with him, and threw him away. Like an old, worn out flute.
Incredible.
Well, the play makes a hero out of a valet. He outwits his noble master and exposes him as a lecher. Do you see the implications? This would be, in a grander situation, as if a Chamberlain were to expose an Emperor.
What? Who the devil are you?
What do you mean - now?
No, Baron, no. I'm afraid Mozart is a lost cause. He has managed to alienate practically the whole of Vienna. He is constantly drunk. He never pays his debts. I can't think of one person to whom I dare recommend him.
Oh, yes. He's just exhausted. He became dizzy, that's all. We should let him rest.
I'm an orderly, not a bleeding psychiatrist! I push things about, but I've little say what happens to them.
He said 'Jack'.
Yes, I believe he did.
I tried to investigate the attack. There are no records. The case was closed and now they've 'misplaced' the file. David's lacerations were cleaned and dressed when he arrived here and yet supposedly no doctor examined him before I did. The Goodman boy is already in the ground so he's no good to us. So I went to the pub in East Proctor where I was convinced of two things.
They were lying. There were no witnesses, no escaped lunatic. The whole community is hiding the truth of what actually happened up there.
Oh, I don't mean running about on all fours and howling at the moon. But in such a deranged state he could harm himself, or perhaps others.
Is David acting strangely?
What?
Please, really. I'm not hungry.
How is that?
Call me Alex.
'A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court' by Mark Twain.
It's okay. I want to talk to you.
Was Jack Goodman your good friend?
No, thank you. Just keep me company for a while.
Lovely.
That's good, Alex.  Reassure me.
A doper werewolf.
Don't you remember?
I should be committed.
I don't know why I feel so good. I haven't felt this good in a long time.
What?
David, don't lose control.
No.
No.
No.
No.
No.
Why on earth do you say that?
Shakespeare was French! The Queen Mother sucks cocks in hell! Shit! Fuck! Piss!
You're going to have to stop this disturbance or I shall arrest you.
No, but we're about to.
You could have told them!
Now we've just given you a pretty strong sedative, so try to get some rest now. Miss Price will see to your needs. Rest now.
Sure, as a kid. But never so real. Never so bizarre.
I've told you, it wasn't a man. It was an animal. A big wolf or something. A rabid dog.
Did you talk to the police in East Proctor? Did the cops go to The Slaughtered Lamb?
Then why the hell are you so quick to disbelieve me? You yourself said it must have taken incredible strength to tear apart a person like that.
Of course not, David. I'll fetch in young Miss Price.
If you don't stop, I'm going to kill you.
I assume full responsibility.
It's a five-pointed star.
Apparently so.
I don't know. Now that we're out here and it's three degrees, I'm not so sure I wouldn't rather face a blood-thirsty mob.
There aren't any coyotes in England.
Walk away, Jack.
Rudy Levine the shmuck?
David!
We were attacked by a werewolf.
Don't be an asshole, David. Come here.
David, I'm sorry I upset you yesterday, but you must understand what is going on.
What about the zoo?
I want you to meet some people.
He's on the telephone.
Oh, that's been there for two hundred years. We were going to paint it out, but it's traditional, so we left it.
You here again? What do you want?
She's a widow. I don't like taking mortgages from widows.
I was the first one to see it. I was coming down the stairs, and there was the watchman lying dead at my feet.
How much?
Ten bucks? Say, if I had ten bucks, I'd quit.
Yeah.
Say, don't annoy me. I got troubles of my own.
Not yet, Mr. Clark.
Yes, sir.
Dickson doesn't have to go. But he must agree to this merger with New York Trust
All right, let him! I'm sick and tired of hearing about him. If he wants to run the bank, let him do it. I don't want any part of it.
What do you mean, help?
So, that's it, eh? You've waited a long time for this chance, haven't you?  Well, I'm not going to resign now - or ever.
I can't? You just wait and see. If that run doesn't stop within the next hour, I'll shut the doors. You know what that means? The bank examiner will step in tomorrow. You'll be forced to liquidate. I'll insist upon it. The depositors will be paid one hundred cents on the dollar. What's left you gentlemen can have. But I'll guarantee there won't be enough to pay your next month's garage bill.
Stand back, Inspector. Let me out of here, or I'll shoot you!
They took my keys yesterday. I went there to get them back.
Nothing, nothing, Mr. Dickson. Don't pay any attention to me. I don't know what I'm saying.
I'm sorry, Dude, butI
Be sure you're with somebody responsible in case any questions are asked. Understand?
Listen, buddy, you're getting by pretty easy. Quit squawking!
What is?
But you see, it isn't blarney where you're concerned.
Yes, yes, it does. What are you doing tonight, Phyllis?
Don't you know I've been crazy about you for years?
Oh, you're not so badly off. There's something much worse than being a misunderstood wife.
A misunderstood bachelor.
Yes, sir.
No?  Then maybe you'll understand, Mrs. Dickson. Oh, gee, he's crazy about you. Nobody knows it better than you. If he ever finds out, it'll kill him.
It's amazing that your sweet, lovely, gorgeous wife can ever get to see you.
But I have to go, dear. It's a very important banker's meeting.
I haven't got any new stories for them this morning, either.
Where is he now?
Mr. Sampson . . .
Yes?
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
She was, wasn't she? How long has this been going on? Do you know?
What are you talking about? He had no more to do with it than you did.
Why, you must be crazy. I've known this man for years.
Here's the data on the Clyde deal.
He says he can't get away in the daytime.
All right. Send down to the vaults and have our reserve cash sent up here right away.
Yes, sir.
Did you get the case for the securities?
Mine too?
What'll we do?
I hate to do this, but I've got to have time to dig up some help. I think I know where I can get some real cash. Snap into it, Sampson. We will lick this thing yet.
Board meeting. Oh, that means hours, I suppose.
Oh, ten dollars
Come here.  You know, a few minutes ago I was in Cluett's office and Mrs. Dickson was there.
Yeah.  I got an idea. Come on, let's get to a telephone.
He left here about an hour ago and went down to Dude Finlay's joint.
What time was it, Mrs. Halligan?
Huh?
I didn't do it! I haven't got a gun!
Yes.
Okay, Matt.
Dammit, this stopped being fun about two years ago!
The sheriff says it was a gang of drunk Kansas boys.
Frankly, yes. I'm feeling a little left out.
As long as people think Jesse's still riding, we will never get the respect we deserve.
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?!
Swear.
... Will Perry ...
Best damn plan I heard all war.
Two.
Not yet. But I'm hoping.
Exactly.
Hey!
You are a fine figure of a man.
There's Yankees back there. Lot's of 'em.
Yeah.
I got three.
Just because he reads all those books and knows all those big words doesn't make him smart.
If you'd read about it first, you'd have no problems.
I've robbed just as many banks as you have! I know this town, and I know this bank, and I say it's an easy job.
I'm out.
Strategically.
Yeah, Injun. What do you want?
On account of we're robbing it.
I'd appreciate that.
So we got a plan?
I figure.
Saved all our lives, Doc. None of the Liberty boys would have come home if not for Web Mimms, Doc. God's honest truth.
Think about this. If we just come up with a story and stick to it, we should be all right.
You can shut up now.
I swear I'll shoot you in your sleep.
Shut up.  Uh, Doc, I was wondering if, uh, this evening, I could come by?
Fine. How'd it go out here?
Bob's upset.
I can't quit and leave you alone. I can't quit until you quit. Ma would've wanted it that way.
Got any ideas, little brother?
Everything but the boring parts.
He's a good Christian and he killed Yankees. Jesus told me that made him an all right boy.
Boys?
Nuh-huh ...
I've been on my back two weeks. I'm sick of it.
What you do to me is unfair. The teasing, I mean.
What?
You planning on being a bachelor your whole life, Jesse James?
Were you planning on kissing me when you finished quoting?
Jesse. What are you thinking? There are bounty hunters and lawmen all over this county!
She's the most wonderful woman in the world. Can't get her out of my mind.
Stop it. This is just sad.
You are a hell of a woman.
Should have just killed Thaddeus Rains and been done with it.
Thank you.
I guess so.
You're gonna tell her when you're resting up in bed with her, Jimmy.
Lyla Devereux.
That is so gentlemanly of you.
Move you fools!
I look forward to seeing it.
I remember you.
What? Oh, I'm...busy.
Pumpkin?
Pumpkin you're dating an asshole.
You know, Courtney, you should take some more lithium. Or have a Diet Coke. Some caffeine might get you out of this slump.
Yes.
Mmmm...thanks, Patrick.
Is it a what?
Because you have to leave half an inch at the tip   to catch the force of the ejaculate! BATEMAN I'm getting out of here. Where's your lithium?
Oh God, just get it over with.
Yes?
It's not that nice.
I don't want to talk about it.
Everybody's rich.
No. I'm not. Why should I ?
It's not.
Oh God, I can't believe this.
Nice.
Thanks, guy, but...she's got a lousy personality.
Is that all you ever have to contribute, Van Patten? "What about fucking dinner?"
You saw the ad in the Times?
What exactly do you mean?
But wait, Harold, what do you mean?
Oh Christ. He can barely pick up an escort girl, let alone...what was it you said he did to her?
But that's simply not possible. And I don't find this funny anymore.
No, you...didn't?
No, Luis. It's not me. You're mistaken.
Where are you going?
Maybe it's just the light.
New card. What do you think?
Ask me a question.
Yes, can you take two tonight, oh, let's say at nine o'clock?
See you then.
I occasionally box with Ricky at the Harvard Club. Anyone else?
Oh no. I have no plans.
You can always he thinner. Look...better.
No, not really.
Are you seeing anyone? I mean, seriously?
Growing. I'm glad you said that.
I don't think I'm gonna make it, Jean.
Well, most guys I know who work in mergers and acquisitions don't really like it.
Yeah, well, oh boy, listen, I've got to go. Thank you, uh... Victoria?
If you had an American Express card she'd give you a blowjob.  Listen, this girl worked in a tanning salon, need I say more?...What do you do?
He's a goddamn drug dealer! These are his peak hours.
Why would I?
Let's not get lewd.  I'm in no mood to have a lewd conversation.
Does he do this all the time?
Mr. Kimball a bottle of San Pelle-
I think his family wants this kept quiet.
Twenty-six. I'll be twenty-seven in October.
I know. I'm sorry.
No, I guess it's okay.
Well...
I hope I'm not being cross-examined here.
Hang...out?
What?
0h no. Informal conversations, mostly. What's that, Stoli?
Wait. That's not what I've got.
Let's see...  That you were with-
Patrick, please. I hope I've been informative. Long day-a bit scattered.
But how? Where do you place Paul that night?
Where was Marcus?
Al.
It's...it's...all right.
No, Owen.
Then you've gotta ask him about that.
No way. You have this -- destiny.
...Why?
...Different?
Okay, yeah. I did something naughty... There's this amazing Comix store in Seattle.  To tell you the truth, I did it once or twice at Stanford. 'Guess I can't keep anything from you...
Look at me! I'm gonna change.
He'll tell me when he gets home.
Instead of busting my chops you should do something about that girl. Fire her. Or something.
Yeah. Hi. Thank you for seeing me.
You can't pre-empt Yoga, that's our biggest show.
What'd they ever do for you?
Great. Great! We need to drag a lot of heavy stuff in front of the door --
You should've called a few times to bug me about your job prospects.
Outpost was his baby, sure. On the other hand, we just learned Gary Boyd owns the Skywire satellites. Personally.
And the kid who wrote Skywire -- then gave it away? They're calling him the digital Robin Hood.
Milo? Gary Boyd. I'm hoping you and your friend can come up here. We've made some amazing strides in digital convergence. I'd love to show them to you.
There's a rumor going around, maybe you've heard it.
Skywire.
Okay. I'm Gary.
Well -- you sent for me.
I'm sure.
Definitely.
Were the flags for Teddy?
Talk about work? Never!
Oh. Yeah.
The wrong place?
'Have a look?
'Sorry about the late notice...
I couldn't do it at work cause of security or at home for -- obvious reasons.
I do know. You focus on the big problem. But somewhere down the chain, something breaks down. Something gets destroyed. At first it's upsetting. You feel you've lost control.
Nothing does. Still. I want him to like me.
In exchange for endowments. They should just drop the pretense and name the schools after 'em.
You do?
We'll come up with the next big thing.
Cool.
Let's get him in here.
We moved around so much I barely knew my teachers.
She saved my life.
Oh yeah?
They'd frame him.
No, no. Never.
Right. But Gary's tied-in to a lot of media conglomerates. Have to be careful who we pick.
What about "60 Minutes."
Time-Warner has a 40 per cent stake in Gary's set-top device. That also takes out CNN.  "GE joins Outpost in new venture," which means NBC is out. "Disney joins Outpost," ABC is out. "Outpost and Newscorp in new deal," Fox is out. Any of these places could have a mole. Or all of 'em.  It's like a a continuous loop. We can go to some alternative press place that 1,000 people read, get them and us killed. But anything big enough for this is a parent of or a subsidiary to something Gary's got a finger in!
What?
Oh.  I liked you. I was checking you out.
Milo? Shrot suspects somebody broke into #21. I was in his office when he was reviewing the card readouts.
He doesn't know about the Day Care.
Perfect.  How am I gonna get away from the party long enough to --
She called to apologize. I said I was pulling an all-nighter. She said then come home just to say Hi. Which I always do when we fight, it's suspicious if I don't.
At this point the worst thing I could do is anything out of the ordinary.
Hey, we got seed money for the startup! A million-five!
I met this girl.
His Snapples were in alphabetical order.
She's a programmer?
Damn. 'Have to go back over there.  Be so much easier if we could walk in the front door.
What do you want, Mr... Cunningham, was it?
Or sometimes not at all.
You're in the Ministry of Defense. It's 1997. You've been cryogenically frozen for thirty years.
No, Austin, Mrs. Kensington has long- since retired. Ms.  Kensington is her daughter.
There's one more thing, Austin.
Austin, Vanessa, let me bring you up to speed. Dr. Evil has high- jacked a nuclear warhead from Kreplachistan and is holding the world ransom for one-hundred billion dollars. If the world doesn't pay up in four days, he's threatening to destroy the world.
Damn it, man! You're talking about my mother!
Thanks.
I'd say that about sums it up, Exposition.
Austin, I have something for you as well.
Hey, Mick!
Really? Let me ask you this. What is love?
Your freedom has cause more pain and suffering in the world than any plan I ever dreamed of. Face it, freedom failed.
Well, as long as people are still having promiscuous sex with many anonymous partners without protection, while at the same time experimenting with mind-expanding drugs in a consequence-free environment, I'll be sound as a pound.
I hope this is part of the unfreezing process.
Well, you know... cows, and shagging.
I couldn't have another bite.
I'm sorry.
No, this is me in a nutshell.
I am not.
Only sailors use condoms, man.
Thirty years of political and social upheaval. The fall of the Berlin wall, a female Prime Minister of England, the abolishment of Apartheid, a fascinating tapestry of human strum und drang.
Basil was very concerned to know where you were last night.
You know who.
Don't worry, baby. I picked up a mind control technique during my travels to India. I learned it from my guru, the late Guru Shastri, a chaste man who mysteriously died of a disease that had all the hallmarks of syphilis.  Just watch me. Watch me, now.
Sadly, no. Hold on! I always keep this on me just in case.
Anyways, what I'm trying to say is that if you want me to be a one-woman man, well, that's just groovy, because... I love you.
Likewise.
Lay it on me.
That's not mine.
Is it one of ours?
Should we scramble TacHQ for an intercept?
Can't you see I'm only half a man? Look at me, I'm a freak!
Yes.
Dr. Evil?
Well, we experimented with lasers, but you would be surprised at how heavy they are. They actually outweighed the piranha themselves, and the fish, well, they sank to the bottom and died.
Don't be so hard on yourself. You're here, that's what's important. A journey of a thousand miles begins with one step.
No. Maybe, like, work in a petting zoo or something.
Thought I'd stay in. There's a good tittie movie on Skinemax.
Yeah. What?
Why don't you just shoot him now? Here, I'll get a gun. We'll just shoot him. Bang! Dead. Done.
I had the group liquidated, you little shit. They were insolent.
You can't judge him by modern standards. He's very much a product of his times. In my day he could have any woman he wanted.
I'm on with a friend!  Look, I'd better go. I love you.
I don't know. I was thinking, maybe I'd be a vet or something, cause I like animals and stuff.
No, he's really evil.
Seriously?
No need. I'll call again.
Sir August...?  What now?
Mr. John Steed, please.
Really -- what happened in 1922?
Eh? In here!
Let me guess -- 'Father'?
Something strange is happening. And whoever knows about it doesn't want us to find out.
We want to help...!
Quite frankly ... it could have been you.
So am I.
Thank you, Steed.
But -- why?
'Our revels now are ended.'
Destruction of their local weather systems. I can zap a thousand Chernobyls into the air.
How Wagnerian ... Do you mean to say you've waited all these years because you couldn't create a chip on your own? That would have amused Peter.
Rules are made to be broken.
Mother?
As per mother's instructions.
I meant me.
Any other vices?
You were very lucky.  Four shots to the heart. I found you after I slipped away from Sir August. Mother brought you here. Not me you should thank.
Perhaps your memory plays tricks, Mrs. Peel.
Did he say who?
Very good, Steed ...
Thanks ...  I see what you mean about letting me do the risking ... Hello?
Don't bother.  Here's a bus ...
Have I trespassed on a male prerogative?  We're being followed. I saw him at Trubshaw's ...
Barely.
Here's the one that broke the camel's back.
The Winslow Home for Retired Lepidoptorists. I'm so sorry I struck you, Mrs. Peel. Please forgive me. I thought you were someone else ...
I expect that's for you to know and me to find out ...
Orders.
Always.  Except ...
Keeping a stiff upper lip?
I thought you didn't.
After you -- Mrs. Peel ...
Why's he called 'Invisible'?
Hurry?  What for?  I'm just now --
It's called Black Leather.
It's the latest thing, Mrs. Peel.
Pity your mother came, too ...
It's Mother you have to convince. He's very agitated.  Wait here.
I fail to see --
Well, I can't possibly go like this.
It was you who gave Valentine Peel his security clearance ... you're the mole who betrayed the Ministry.
Anyone particular in mind?
Where?
Ask not for whom the telephone rings ...
Walk over to the window ...
Perish the thought.
If you say so.
You are, and it's behind you.
Debbie's marrying Rick.
Really -- you went with him for two years.
Bobbie, what are you talking about?
I feel like I'm spying on Rick.
Rick's got an important announcement to make.
When do the girls get to the party?
You dump her and I'll give you cash.
Five thousand dollars.
I'm marrying Debbie.
Ah, Cole.  I don't remember ordering an asshole from room service.
Oh, come on, just a little.
Ooh, be still, my heart.
She's mine!
Yes I did.
Yes, sir, I am.
I've tried to change her mind.
Over here, Deb... in the Smokehouse.
You know, when you dumped me for that wimp, I thought, Cole, she'll be back. God wants the two of you to be together, and sure enough...
You're marrying him? Then why are you coming back to me?
But a fabulous cook.
Want to hear something great? Bobbie and Phoebe are throwing me a shower. It's really gonna be fun.
It looks awful.
I can't sleep.
C'mere.
Anything you say, ma'am. Have a fun shower. Use soap.
C'mon, I knew it was you.
I am committed. I love you.
You don't believe me? Okay, fine.
Let's get naked.
Yeah.
Look, you heard what those hookers said. They were supposed to go to a bachelor party.
Debbie, men are pigs -- if they can have women, we can have men.
You know your father enjoys his company.
I hope those guys are all right.
I think I screwed that one once.
Any time, Al.
Hey. I'm sorry. You want girls. I'll give you girls.
Let's have a toast.
Screw that.
I want women.
Sold. 45 minutes. No problem.
Just in love with everybody. It's really a beautiful planet. I love you, Rick. I love you guys. I love everybody.
Naw, two on a Quaalude... bad luck.
I'm trying to slash my wrists.
This is the Park View Hotel. I'm the Hotel Manager. Are you looking for someone?
Can't I just maim it a little?
In a second...  And you're irresponsible. Show some initiative, try to better yourself, stop showing off, actions speak louder than words.
I'm separated.
This isn't right.
Hey, I'm starved... Let's go get something to eat. We'll bring back food for everybody.
C'mon. I insist.
The best table in the house.
Get a few drinks into me, we'll dance and see what happens.
Got me.
Still drawing a blank.
Okay, Rick, all finished. I can't wait for that bachelor party... I need the action.
Thanks, Stan, you've been a lot of help.
Great.  I was wondering, how do you guys go to the bathroom in that thing?
Yeah. Who'd have thought they'd both be a size 138 regular.
It isn't safe, man. Don't go splittin' us up. Not with this one.
-- What the fuck were you thinking, huh? Burning people? You're a fireman.
Stevie... I...
That was an accident! Jesus Christ, why did you have to go in there so fucking early? Why didn't you listen to me!
Who asked you?
I want to thank you for coming to my graduation, Stephen. It was a great inspiration to me.
Millions, Stephen -- And sexual favors.
So that's it? Big bad brother's gonna ride my ass till I cough blood?
What you did was drop the ball, Probie. Get that right.
-- Never mind.
Christ, Stephen, let's wait for the hose team...
Just leave me alone, okay?
Look, Stephen, maybe we can talk about this some other --
I don't know, Brian... I don't know...
"You never know till the fire stares you down if you're gonna be --"
I'm sorry... I'm sorry I thought... I won't.
So... I see you're still in the neighborhood.
Yeah? What have you been up to?
Really? No kidding.
Yeah. Swayzak. Humanity's last hope. How can you work for that guy?
So now you suddenly care about my future?
How's it going?
Green committed to a thousand.  There's another fund-raising party tonight. Marty'd really like you to come.
Hey...  So are you dating your boss or what?
Sorry.  Are you dating anyone?
Well, you did invite me here.
-- I work for the city.
Hi.
Swayzak knows something about the guys that were murdered. I want to know why he keeps that hidden.
Your boss is lying, Jennifer.
So you came to me...  Well, this is going to be an interesting afternoon after all...
Then who --
I don't have a story.
What?
Trychticholorate.
But he killed these guys.
Fire.
Son of a bitch. They knew each other.
And Cosgrove. Coppers figured he laundered money for the mob before getting into real estate. They weren't very high on Seagrave, either.
Yeah? Airtight?
Yeah.
You guys ought to try picking up a phone once in awhile.
Backdraft.
Ah man, is he usin' that line now on you? What, you think he made that little gem up? Jesus Christ, I used to have to listen to my old man use that every morning.
"Probationary Fireman Brian McCaffrey, on his very first fire, showed the kind of bravery and courage of a veteran firefighter when he risked life and limb to double-check a burning floor alone, emerging victoriously with Anna Rodriguez, a seamstress for the North Shore Clothing Company... McCaffrey first gained prominence as the subject of a 1972 Pulitzer Prize winning photograph taken at the scene of his father's death..."
There's no replacement 'cause of your boss' cuts, if that's what you mean. If someone else goes out on an injury we're really screwed.
Management were pin heads.
Call in another alarm. We're gonna need some back-up.
I'm busy.
I'll be there, goddamn it!
Stephen, I'm kinda busy here, can we talk about this later?
-- No, that's okay. It's just Sean...
How ya doin', Ronald. Staying comfortable?
I know you.
Tell him about me, Shadow?
And old ladies?
Are the glory boys actually showing interest in Investigation's work? I may have a stroke.
Investigator...
I'm not talking about the fucking Church. Fuck the Church. But tell me. Do you believe in God?
Yeah.
Who?
You mean you could use it.
Yes.
Uh - right. Sure. The Mets are gonna win tomorrow.
Me?
Please. Please don't forgive me. I've always hated you for that.
Why? Jesus! Why me? Why can't I wash the ashes from my forehead, year after year after year? And why am I still drunk on your blood, the taste of your flesh on my tongue? Worst of all, why can't I feel the nails in my palms, the spear in my side, the crown of thorns round my head? Why do I have to know, over and over, that it was you. You who died; died for my sins! And that I will die for nothing. Why?
Let me think about it.
Yeah, sucker. You better be there!
All right. What are you gonna do?
There's just no way the Mets will lose this game. Gooden is pitching and Strawberry is ready to break out.
You're a fucking joke, you know that?  He's been waiting for the money since the fucking game ended. And I've been waiting here since -- forget it. Listen up. You're gonna get us both fucking killed. You know that!
Sister, we all know what happened to you yesterday morning. I expected that you would want to speak to me about it. But you could have come to my office. Your being here, in the confessional, implies that you, Sister, have done something wrong. You haven't. I assure you. I feared you might have misplaced feelings of guilt. If you condemn yourself because you experienced feelings of... curiosity or even... pleasure, you mustn't --
It's funny, you knew. But the first thing I think of is kneading the bread that I help bake for the soup kitchen. Maybe that's because my the muscles in my arms still hurt.
You knew them?  Who were they, Sister? Who are these boys? What are the names of these -- good boys you knew?
I'm on it.
YEAH!
Let's go NIGGERS.
Hook you up?  The Mau-Mau's?  You must be smoking.  Why in the world would I want to hook up a bunch of red, black and green flag-waving pseudo revolutionairies?
Who are you revolting against?
What makes you think he would write a show about the Mau-Mau's.
I'm a revolutionary.
You might be right.
Naw, not you.  It can't be.  That hottie Sloan Hopkins.
No shame in ya game.  She got ya nostrils, ya chnoz is wide open. Sloan's what we certified ladies' men call low hanging fruit.
She's also moorish.
Must be the pressure.
What are you talkin' about?
Meaning?
Damn skippy.
Don't shoot me, I'm just the piano players.
You'd take no offense if we called you DeLa for short?
Manray needs a job.
You'll both get an advance and you can stay with me.
To what?
Why?
Because race has always been a sensitive issue in this country. Gary, I have no problem with people disagreeing with the show, it's when folks start trying to mess with my inherent right as an artist, that's when I get mad.  No one, in any way, shape or form should be censored.
Don't you people get it?  We're in the 21st Century.  Slavery was over four hundred years ago.  All that stuff people talked in the old days, it's over.  Folks always crying, white man this, white man that.  Let's all grow up.
...to white?  I still feel all of my scripts would make good shows.
So let's take this great form, this very American tradition of entertainment into the 21st century, into the new millennium.
It is called: MANTAN - THE NEW MILLENNIUM MINSTREL SHOW.
Let'em try.  I will kill to make this happen.
Calm down, please.
They didn't even view a rough cut, just some scenes we quickly cut together.
Pleased to meet you.
Daddy, she's younger than me.
Nuthin' I can't handle.
Where do you go from here?
Is that so?
The drinking is for the pain.  It doesn't kill it, just dulls it.
Your father is proud of you.
Why didn't you tell me about this staff meeting?
This is Cheeba.
It was the principle.  Dunwitty had to be enlightened.  I was making a point.  I take pride in my work. Plus, I already told you I wasn't gonna walk away from my money.
What do you want me to say?
The pleasure is mine.
A small victory isn't that small when you've been use to losing.
This is authentic, not a repro, circa turn of the century.
To me, it shows part of our history in this country, a time when we were considered inferior, sub-human.
Please don't go there.
Naw.  I'll take the zero.
I will.  And good luck with your show.  I hope it's a huge success. You've worked very hard.  You deserve it.
I can't go all the way down south.
C'mon, Mommy.  Daddy hasn't been impressed with anything I've ever done.  From winning my fifth grade Spelling Bee to the present.
Soon.
My visual style is very erotic, sexy, how do you say - hot?
Thank you very much.  I always try my best.
We all stick to this, it's smooth sailing.
You've never had any formal training, either?
What do you mean?
Money makes the world go round.  It ain't no joke being poor.  I know whatI'mtalkin''bout. Y'knowwhatI'msayin'?  I've lived on the street.  I've been homeless. I've learned how to play the game, work the game, be in the game.
And this is my very best friend Mantan.
Tell 'em what you mean Mistuh Mantan.
...no, she didn't...
...too late, maybe around...
...like grits and butter...
Mantan, it is possible that my hyphenated sentences are entirely too complex for all the intellect contained in that diminutive coconut?
A song a comin' I feel.
Just a little something' somethin'.
Gots no intention of ending up broke.
Maybe I need to do a lot of things.
I just don't want you and Cheeba to get hurt.
My people love me.
Why don't you answer?
I'll tell you what it is, Mr. Dugan. I have had enough of Miss Dugan here and your Irish ways.  I ain't used to 'em, sir.
I have acted as I think fit.
It's a lie!  You're a deserter! You're an impostor, sir; Your lies and folly have confirmed this to me. You pretend to carry dispatches to a general who has been dead these ten months; you have an uncle who is an ambassador and whose name you don't know.  Will you join and take the bounty, sir, or will you be given up?
There is lately come to Berlin a gentleman in the service of the Empress Queen, who calls himself the Chevalier de Belle Fast, and wears the red riband and star of the pope's order of the Spur.  He is made for good society, polished, obliging, a libertine, without prejudices, fond of women, of good food, of high play, prudent and discreet.
Mark this, come what will of it, I swear I will fight the man who pretends to the hand of Dorothy Dugan.  I'll follow him if it's into the church, and meet him there. I'll have his blood, or he shall have mine.  Will you take my message to him, and arrange the meeting?
A man of honor dies, but never apologizes.  I'll see the captain hanged before I apologize.
Mrs. John Best!  Was there another Mr. John Best?!
Which O'Higgins do you know?  For I have never heard your name mentioned in my family.
I deny your Grace's accusations, and beg you to say how you have been cheated?
I will let down the steps for your honor.
Certain?
Certainly, monseigneur, does not Your Excellency consider her worthy of love?
Very well!  Now that I know it, I will no longer love her.
I believe you, and I see I must hasten to leave, for otherwise I shall become the unhappiest of men.
Yes -- but I am afraid of being deceived.
We then spent an hour in the most eloquent silence except that, from time to time, her ladyship cried out:  "Oh, my God.  Is it true -- I am not dreaming?"
With pleasure at finding the ribbon.
I don't care a fig for Captain Best; he dances prettily to be sure, and is a pleasant rattle of a man.  He looks well in his regimentals, too; and if he chose to ask me to dance, how could I refuse him?
But Captain Best is already known as a valiant soldier, and is famous as a man of fashion in London.  It is mighty well of you to fight farmers' boys, but to fight an Englishman is a very different matter.
Yes, for I wish to entertain splendidly.
All right, five hundred guineas.
What is to be done?
Mr. Newcombe, I have made some difficult loans during the past few years, at very onerous terms, but 18% a year interest seems very stiff indeed.
Is it not a pleasure, gentlemen, for me, as I am drawing near the goal, to find my home such a happy one; my wife so fond of me, that she is even now thinking of appointing a successor?  Isn't it a comfort to see her; like a prudent housewife, getting everything ready for her husband's departure?
And he doesn't care about me?
Tender Hegenheim.
Yeah, and I could've used the sleep. I'm supposed to meet people here tonight, try and get some work going.
I'm -- I'm sorry...
What do we do?
It was the grenade you fucking idiot. Look at him!
We found him like this --
What do you mean, alone?
It's... too slow.
Fifteen years ago under Sergeant West. Piece of work, that guy. I remember, he used to have these two silver .45's with ivory handles and if you weren't quick enough, he'd knock you on the head with one of them. He still carry those guns?
I'm not telling you what happened.
He's lying.
You saw West's body.
You wanna bet?
Oh, you don't? What else do you have on me? You haven't found any bodies yet, have you?
Sir, yes, sir!
Yeah...
You're the only one missing a grenade.
Oh, come on --
Enough to go to prison? Childs' PX scam, Mueller was in on it --
Look in my pack.
Becoming a morphine addict during Basic ain't exactly something you want to broadcast. Only Mueller and Childs know.
Put it down!
Senator Daddy must be thrilled.
I didn't kill him --
I honestly don't know. Maybe to have someone to cover for him. And I wish I could, but there's no doubt in my mind he killed those men.
Stop.
No. I said Dunbar.
I didn't do anything --
Would I have called you if it wasn't? If there was any other way --
The guy in interrogation said he'd only talk to a cop.
Who killed Pike?
JAG gets here in three hours. Try for the confession.
You're drunk --
That's preposterous --
You're crazy --
For the last time, I have no idea what you're talking about --
You knew Sergeant West?
Hurricane knocked out our Mainframe, so all we have are their dogtags. Cadets Raymond Dunbar and Levi Kendall --
Senator Jonathan Kendall, of Ohio.
You had a mobile of bayonets above your crib.
Imagine what it must have been like for them out there. What do you think of Dunbar?
What point?
You did more than try. You cracked Dunbar in less than three minutes, as an investigator you're phenomenal --
And they're smart about it. They know when you commit a crime you know is going to be investigated, you need a fall guy and for that to work, you have to have a witness.
Exactly, someone who's not involved, who's word can't be questioned. You only let them see what you want them to see, you make them believe, so when the time comes, they've totally bought into your version of events.
And all hell breaks loose. A lot of Good guys shoot a lot of bad guys and whiz, bang, zoom, happy ending.
That bugs you too?
You mean the falsely accused?
Get in.
Isn't this how your story goes?
This is the perfect time. You know what makes a good detective? The number of confessions they get. You're a good detective, Osborne. So now you get mine.
There are degrees of truth, officer. Always degrees.
Really.
Want company?
In case you need me to testify about the shooting. They'll clear you.
Although that won't matter much when coupled with the murder charge --
The faggot speaks.
Oh, you remember now --
It will and you know why? Because you're not a person anymore, you're a cadet in the United States Army; you have no identity, no Miranda warning, and no rights. So I'm gonna throw you to the wolves, and unlike you, I'm gonna get away with it, because you're pissing me off!
Wrong answer --
I scared Dunbar into silence. He's been trying to cover for me the whole time. We got here, you came to see me... I didn't know if I could trust him with that kind of secret --
Still got mine on, not a speck of blood on it. Not a bad trick for a murderer -- you said you burned yours?
We're not going anywhere.
Bullshit --
I called the JAG Corps, the two cadets we retrieved are to be flown to D.C. on a transport leaving here at 1700 --
Sir, yes, sir!
Yes.
Why?
Fine, I'm doing it.
I didn't know she belonged to anybody.
You're pretty good at arithmetic.
I promise. Someday. When I'm really supposed to.
I was dreaming.
That's terrible.
No, I understand.
Well, we were all set to, but there was a complication.
Mine's Edward. And truthfully, I do want you to leave, Karl. But I want to leave with you.  You think this town is too small for you, well, it's too small for a man of my ambition. I can't see staying here a day longer.
You think I'm up for it?
Really.
Okay.
I think someone hasn't.
Dad?
The river?
Yes. Exactly.
But you're wrong. I do know you, at least by reputation. Edward Bloom from Ashton. See, I'm actually engaged to a boy from Ashton. Don Price. He was a few years older than you.
I called everywhere in five states and explained this was the only way I could get my wife to marry me.
I see. We need to get you one of those plant misters. We can spray you like a fern.
You're a poet. You oughta be able to. And maybe if you'd seen more, you could.
'Fraid so.
This was on his sales route, so he was through here all the time. Everyone in town knew him.
My father talked about a lot of things he never did, and I'm sure he did a lot of things he never talked about. I'm just trying to reconcile the two.
I know. It was the same when I was carrying Will. Like clockwork.
You don't have to.
Everyone loves my father. He's a very likeable guy.
You're not.
I am always on your side. And I think you should talk to him.
Yes.
He just fell asleep. Josephine's with him.
I suppose your grandmother's house when she passed on. But we sold that right away. Your cousin Shirley bought it.
Heavens no. We had a hard enough time keeping the mortgage on this place.
No I don't.
I've been buying you stuff all week. I've been buying him stuff all week.
Yeah. It was quite good actually. Some bits I really liked.
What are you doing here?
Ch...
He says he feels safe here.
So I come to England with other actors to make shows, I meet this freak from Novgorod I tell him of you and Chicken and the birthday here we are.
No. It is too judgmental.
He says why did you send to Russia for a wife.
Fine. I thought you were leaving today.
He says you are very sad ridiculous man. I don't agree of course. And that you must pay someone to have sex like a prostitute. Nadia is a prostitute. I'm sorry.
I'll fuckin' give it to him! We'll go down there.
I've got eight hundred pounds. Oh Jesus.
I'm so sorry.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Syevodnya
Yes I know.
You don't understand anything.
No I don't.
You can't hurt me more than I'm hurt already.
What? No you're not..
Shut up. Have you got your passport?
I don't want to talk about him.
It's none of your business.
He left me my passport and ticket. It's pretty clear he wants to see me again.
And. It's wrong.
So. What then? You just detach sex from everything..
There's nothing wrong in liking sex, John.
You didn't mind too much.
Please, there's no... Oh.
Thank Christ for that.
Not really. Maybe a little.
I don't know why I said it. I'm sorry.
Maybe I want to die. Don't you want me to die?
No. I think I better just go.
Please. Why not?
I'm quitting. This will be my last one. So. Goodbye.
Right.
Sophia. Hello Sophia. Mine's still John.
Yeah, I know.
Yes, ma'am.
Go on, Laz. You can talk to me.
I need ya help again.
Why you stop havin' dancin' on Saturday? Used to have bands... all kind's live shit. Like a wake up in here, now.
No, ma'am.
I got others.
It's so stupid. Says to me that he don't want nothin' to do with no military career. Says he wants to move. Open up an auto shop with his uncle up in Knoxville. I said, okay. How about now? Let's go.
If you come to talk about that muthafucka, I'm gonna get up and leave you sittin' pretty in that new suit he bought'cha.
Say what you gotta say, but I ain't gonna hear you speak his name to me. Not never. You hear?
Carryin' on behind my back. Make me out to look like a fool to all our people. Tell me, what's friendly about that?
Rose... please...
Put all your love and dreams into one woman... she turn around and give it all to another man. That's a good reason to paint the wall with me, kid. She'd fear ya then. Cuz there won't be no more question in her mind. She with a real man now. A real KILLER!
Son, I'm grown. Don't got patience to suffer you children and this monkey junk. I'm too old to play house...  ...and cowboys. So let's have it. End me or get out of my face!
Come on, gal...
How long... how long I been out?
Well I'm woke now... you can take this off.
You sick. You got a sickness... we broke that fever... we gonna break that hold the devil got on ya.
Sure.
No joke.
I ain't in a hurry.
You know how you feel when you come out of a bad hangover? Like your eyes can open a little bit more.
Uh-huh.
I didn't start this, R.L.
This ain't got nothin' to do with that woman. Just don't want nobody around me now.
Man like you ought not take the Lord's name like you just done.
I'm tellin' you the truth, dammit. I found her beat. Left for dead. So I brung her home.
I haven't laid a hand. On my life, R.L., my wick is dry on this.
One thing at a time, Laz.
She's tied to me, R.L.. We tied to each other.
I don't know, but I been told, them Georgia women sweet jelly roll.
I do.
I'm gonna tell you somethin', and it's just gonna be between you and me.  I think folks carry on about heaven too much. Like it's some all-you-can- eat buffet up in the clouds. And folks just gonna do as they're told so they can eat what they want behind some pearly gates. I can go to Shoney's for that.
All them people shoutin' your name like they were doing tonight! Shit! That arm you got'll get'chu on a box of cereal...
Ronnie...
You never needed nobody. Always made that clear to me.
Home.
So why dive through the glass for a nickel and dime bust?
Charlie...
Maybe we should do something?
Where would you look for the mafia?
That's what you said in the last three piss pots.
Sure.
If you're gonna give me a hard time, wait outside.
Smells like Bayonne at low tide.
Good.  Very good...
Gaiijin.
I want to yank Kobo.
What...?  Why?
For Sugai.  Caviar, French cheese, ham... If you come to apologize for interrupting his meeting, Sugai may feel obligated to see you.
It's done.  You don't have to come.
I followed them.  An hour from the train station.
Now we've got nothing to negotiate with.
Luck.
Joyce, give the assistant Chief Inspector a drink, would you?
He gets as much as he wants.
Somebody must be suffering somewhere, you're being so nice.
I need someone to translate for me.
It's my last shot.  I have to be on a plane home tomorrow night.
You met her.
I don't remember you saying no.
Last time you asked me to come along I nearly got a hole in my head.
I'm taking you back.
I'm amused.
Yeah.
Why?
Incompetent is letting people waltz through a secure area wearing your uniforms, carrying official documents.
Do you know what this is?
The young are eating the old, something that usually doesn't happen here.
For God's sake, Ohashi, I need your help.  Let me out of here!
I'm impressed.  But let's use the short form.  I'm looking for --
The other plate is currently in New York, in the hands of Kobo's man. Find it for me.
I don't think there is another human being in this whole world who would have helped us.
What about E.M.S. recombination?
Wouldn't obstruct replication, but it does give rise to an error in replication, so that the newly formed DNA strand carries a mutation and you're got a virus again... but all this is academic -- you are made as good as we could make you.
Tyrell could help us, Sebastian.
When do you deliver your project?
Thank you.
Just thought I'd...
He's not ready yet.
Hello, glad to meet you.
Okay, but don't kill him.  Save a little for everybody.  A masterpiece.
There wasn't much left of him, so we can't be sure.  But bio- chemical data and morphology records of the Nexus-6 were reported missing.  Going on the possibility they might try to infiltrate we send Holden in to run Voight-Kampff tests on the new employees.  Guess he found himself one.
We're using Esper -- a 231 -- that picked up Holden's alarm.  Its guess is that all five are in the city.
This is Esper and I'm ready.  Go ahead please.
Why, yes, of course.
I know all that.
Ya.
Two months.  But this one is not guy.  It is girl.  His girl.
I don't know.
I'm doing okay.
I think I'm starting to empathize with these Nexus-sixes.
True.
Too old.
Of course.
What did she want?
The girl that doesn't look like that girl.
What night?
Of course he's not real.  You think I'd be working here if I could afford a real snake?
You mean the snake.
Why should I be?
Is this testing whether I'm an android or a lesbian?
What's a long time?
What?
Yes.
Nothing is infallible, but so far the Voight-Kampff scale bas been foolproof.
How do you know I'm not?
I'm tired of this.
Don't move.
What one?
A tortoise.  What's that?
Of course.
I was tired and didn't have any place to go.
I have some, but I have to find out where they are staying.
Thanks.
She is a dancer! And a lovely one! You would like her very much! Shall we dance?
How do you do?
Come where?
Oh, brother...
Shallow? I'm shallow?!
Yes, ma'am.  But my name is Adam.
Yes, I'm right?
Where are you staying? The Holiday Inn?
Rogers Hornsby?!?
So what?!  I've got two of him!  And this many DiMaggios and Robinsons. I was holding these out, too.
Okay, okay!  Take it easy!
Oh, I could die...
Okay, down boy.  I can't take this for driving you home. I wish I could, but I can't. So here, take it back. I could have just left it for you at the desk, but it's very valuable. Now take it.
Take it. damn it!
Can't you please just talk to me for one second?
What?
No problem.  We'll just sell another baseball card.
Name it.
No, no!  I'm sorry!  What is it?
No dogs, huh? Okay.
The engine is still running.
You said it would be easy!
He's gone to check your answers on his computer.
That's boring!
Yeah? No kidding. Listen, you still want to go girl hunting tonight?
Hey, screw you! Okay? You think I'm just somebody you can buy off! Listen, let me tell you something--
Yeah, sweet.  That's a nice way of putting it.
You think I'm some sort of sap?! Don't you?!
I'm sorry.
Thanks.
Hi, Adam.  This is, uh....
Ooooohhhh!!  Of course! The father! Forgive me!!  Can you forgive me for my wasted life?!  Everything has been so awful!!
No, son. A pitcher.
Uh, no. There's a man who throws the ball -- to a man who has a bat.
Blow out the candles!
I'll try.
Uh, I think they have.
I've never met anyone like you in my life.
Russia.
Juneau.
I'm not wearing his pants.
Miss Rustokov refuses to let total strangers drive her car.
How 'bout we check with Eve first?
So, did you buy a movie?
Of what?
I see.  Well, thank you very much. You've been very, very nice.
My father is a genius.
How old do I look?
Good!
I see what ya mean. Tell you what...I'll give you five hundred dollars in small bills for the whole box.
Well, we're here to help!
Oh, you got a problem with that?
Heck, I know that mom! You're my parents.
Yes.
He'll catch him.  Hi. This is Nina Aron.  I've got a run away and I'm going to need police assistance.
What?!  A light!  Yes, I've got a light!
The blast?  Honey, I have survived a host of things. Like the song says: "A country boy can survive!"
Worse than your Kraft Holiday dip?
Rather safe than sorry. That's my motto!
To keep us from trying to leave. After an atomic blast there's a radiation half-life that lasts thirty five years.
All our friends...
I'm not hungry.
I told you! I've got everything!
If I...you know...
If he tells, it won't come true!
Oh, yes.  It just fascinates me how all    these things work.
Just open the door.
I don't believe it!
Oh my. Oh,my, oh my, oh, my. So, what do we do now?
Well, I am the head of this household--
I thought ten years.
Your stuff?  Let me see that.
Well, that's blunt!
I think...it...works.
Eve?!
Right here?  Well, you're being so bossy I wasn't sure!
We did not leave together.
Those sluts!
To bed.
Yes, you do!
You know, I asked him about that. And he said that good manners are a way we have of showing other people that we respect them. See, you'd eat like a slob if you were alone, but since another human being is present, you show that person respect by going to the trouble of having proper manners. I didn't know that. I thought it was a way of appearing superior.  Know what else he told me?
He thinks that I am a gentleman and that you are a lady!
From the oddest place. His parent's told him. I don't think I got that memo.
Oh.  Well, you're...certainly welcome!
I don't know.  Everything's so neat. It's all just so...goddamn dear.  Damn!
Well, at least I fell for him before I found out he was rich! That's new.  Wait a minute! He said today he knew where home was. What happened this morning?! Where did you go?!
Could I, like...oh, wow...like,uh...
Yeah!  Yeah, that's it!
Say your problem, Wolf One. Are you declaring an emergency?
Roger, Wolf One.
I've seen a few.
Okay honey.
Certainly Frank.  Darling, get some glasses. We'll have some beer with Frank. Won't you sit down?
Darling, where are the glasses? Oh, here they are.
Yep, that's right. Let's take a look at it.
I understand. I'm just real curious like you said.
Okay.
Blue. It's Blue Velvet.
Hi. Hi Sandy. I'm sorry to bother you, but I've got to talk to you.
Yeah.
Pest control, gotta do your apartment.
Jeffrey nothing.
I wanted to see you.
Nobody.
Well.
Never before this.
I, I don't know.
Yes, I like you.
Do you know?
It's a secret so don't tell anyone. Some day I'll show you where. I've gotta go to sleep now.
I, uh.
That's not crazy. I like you too.
There you go again. Stop saying that. You can make it.
No.
Or do you just want me? I'm going to let you enter me now.
Hello.
I'm sorry, maybe I better go Dorothy.
Frank is coming?
Sure I do.
I'm doing it.
Frank would open you.
Does that scare you?
Kiss me.
Sometimes I think I do.
Just get outta my bed.
Shhhhhh. Now I have your disease.
He's a friend. From the neighborhood. We were just talking.
He became obsessed with her. She hated him. He had to have her. He kidnapped them to control her. To make her do things. Then she wanted to commit suicide so he started cutting off ears as a warning to her to stay alive. I'm not kidding. Frank loved blue, blue velvet. He had to have Dorothy cause her whole life was blue.
Right here Frank. You want me to pour it?
Be right down.
I mean, some guys play anyway but they usually get slaughtered.
Uh-uh.
Uh-uh.
It's good to see you, Dad.
I just know, that's all. I remember you from Central.
Yes.
I don't really know much but bits and pieces. I hear things. My room is right above my father's office. The ear, there's no corpse in the morgue missing an ear, and it did come off a living person. That's direct from the Coroner's Office. The person is unknown. There are a couple of cases I get mixed up on, but I think there are some people who were brought in for questioning on a murder case that could have something to do with the ear. I heard some of the same names.
Not really, why?  You want to see the building? Come on, I'll show you.
Where are they?
My father is watching the businessman. The businessman had a partner who disappeared. Left his whole business and family, his wife and two kids. They think he's been murdered.
Yeah, I guess so.  What are you going to do now that you're home?
Still, it must be kinda rough.
I don't know. He moved away.
I'm here, aren't I?
Right out in the car I happen to have some old overalls and a bug spraying rig. I will go to her apartment and be the pest control man. I will spray her apartment. After a few minutes you will knock on her door, drawing her attention away from me and I will then jimmy a window.
Yeah, let's get outta here. What happened?
Yes and no. Did you recognize him?
You didn't goof it up, but you still owe me one. I want to sneak in tonight. It's Friday, do you have a date tonight?
Well, it's Friday night and you're a beautiful girl. I guess you would have a date, that does that.
First of all, we'll have a nice dinner. Try to find out where Dorothy sings.
I'll drink to that.
Leave it in the front of your house for me, okay?
Okay, okay. Bye.
Yes.
Why are there people like Frank. Why is there so much trouble in this world?
I guess so. You want to help me watch Frank? I'm going to stake out Frank's place tomorrow with a camera.
I will. I'll pick you up on the same corner at three thirty-five, okay?
Okay, Sandy.
Maybe. But I think the Yellow Man is on drugs. I think Frank supplies him.
Yeah, you're a mystery. I like you. Very much.
No.
Really. You want to dance with someone else?
Okay. Let's get her over to your father's.
Go ahead.
Okay.
Yeah. I was only twelve or thirteen when you guys used to talk about him, like he was a ghost or something.
Go find one.
Look in the trash around their hands. See if you can find me two bullet casings. 45's, if my eye serves me right. Don't disturb them. Mark them as they lay. Newman, root through this shit.  If this was a sink find me some metal parts. Gimme a faucet or a drain cover or something.
Get a hold of yourself, man.
Yes.
Shit. She's on every drug know to man. She'd have sold that thing for a dime bag. Screw her.  But I do kinda feel like an ass-hole.
MEEE! ME! I'm the guy! I know everyone, their habits, where they hang out, who they talk to. I know where they fuckin' live. We could kill everyone!
Mother, what are you sayin'? You're talkin' crazy here.
What... the dirty bitch! I hope ya trounced her a good one!
Yeah. It's been twenty-seven years.
"I'm afraid we can't let that one go, Ivan."
We'll find it. Just calm down.
Oh, you're good. What were you gonna do? Laugh the last three to death, funny man?
He's a good man.
We do not ask for your poor or your hungry.
Do not kill, do not rape, do not steal. These are principles which every man of every faith can embrace.
Nah, too quick half their infrastructure got taken out at the Copley plaza. Besides, if you're a hitter, you're either working for the Russians or the Italians. There's no riding the fence. Our little theory from last night just got blown to shit. Something... new is going on here.
My, my...
What?
Brilliant. So now we got a Huge guy theory and Serial crusher theory. Top fucking notch.  What's your name?
Shit! Shit!
It tells us that he was the last to die. All these men  Were carrying. They came in, dropped all in seconds and then took their time with fag man. Didn't they, Duffy?!  They sure as fuck did!
Okay, seriously, both you listen ta me now.
Just called ta torture us did ya?
Yeah. Anybody call for me?
Hey, Murph.
I'm fuckin' fine.  Catch you on the flip side.
This is some crazy shit, man!
Fuck you both! Ya ask me, he was aiming at you!
Well, I'd say that makes him a lia- fuckin-bility.
You have entered the house of the Lord of your own free will speaking of beliefs and feelings. Is it so much to believe that God has brought you here?
It is easy to be sarcastic about religion. It is harder to take small hints from God, your feelings and listen to them... to take a stand.
Those who do not act are in a constant state of ethical indecision.
Then you must find out what your beliefs are.
Yes! Yes! I was thinking that, too. No. I was feeling it. All I needed was to hear you say it! Amen! I'll help them.
God have mercy on my soul.
Yeah. Thanks, Rocco. See ya.
I caught your show down at the velvet room at the Holiday Inn, loved it when you busted into Viva Las Vegas.
Right. The blond guy.
He's not there. Huggie Bear isn't in every single episode.
As part of his plan. I don't know why.
No. This is he.
Kind of. Except we've already got the keys.
She's an attractive older woman.
But Dignan, do you really know that much about rare coins?
You're making fun of my family. You know there's nothing to steal from my mom and Craig. You know exactly what you're saying.
That sets it off.
Eight dollars.
Yeah.
Unlock that door.  Check the aisles.
Oh, shit. That was scary. In the middle of the robbery. The manager looks at me. Right in the eye. And goes, I'm going to remember you.
Bob?
No, I'm not saying her. I'm just saying, I don't know.
I know. But once you get inside you're home free.
Jerry.  And this is my associate Cornelius.
Sure.
No. I didn't. Dignan, they don't speak English.
No. Not really. Inez speaks a little.
You were asleep.
Well, I didn't do it, did I?
I didn't realize you had such an incredible ability to feel sorry for yourself, Dignan.
What?
I don't know, Dignan. I just --
Shh.
She needed it.
I know that. But --
Let me feel that.
Bob!
I'm sorry, Bob.
Eleven fifteen.
As a person?
Let's go. Come on.
Come on, Kumar.
Applejack's stuck in the elevator?
I'm not kidding.
Oh, I'd say about --
We're not sure yet. It's going to need some repairs.
You're kidding.
How?
It's called a racquet, Anthony, and you're holding it wrong. That's ghetto play. Hold it like this.
Hold it.
What do you mean?
Yes, he did.
Yeah. I mean, I don't think about it all the time. But once in awhile I kind of go, Woah. Man.
Who?
Pot is an herb. It's just like any type of gardening.
I don't know. Sure, I guess.
He looked too shaken-up.
Cause I'm not getting any better. It's a waste of time.
No. I wasn't adopted.
Cause you would of let my brother rot in jail.
No, I'm having a heart attack. Of course, I'm OK. What's that supposed to mean?
Who's got the car keys?
His health isn't very good, you know. They take that into account.
Like silk?
I hear you're a good thief.
What do you mean?
Hell, no. This is a '72. I was driving a '63 Pontiac.
I don't know, Bob. What about one of those?
Yes. I did.
You should take a look. I have an entire crop in my backyard.
That's your domain.
Well, in reality it's not that dangerous, Bob. It's only dangerous if you don't know what you're doing.
I'm putting a piece of tape on my nose.
My brother's in jail.
Well, the marijuana crop is a good start.
I don't know.
I'm going back.
His name's not Future Man, Dignan.
You don't even know his name.
Not bad.
Not a whole lot, Bob.
Yeah. It is.
I don't expect an apology and I don't even want one. I just want us to --
I know it, man. Hang on.
Yeah?
We don't have rooms, Bob. We have cells.
I don't really want to talk about it, Bob.
Yeah. Hey, Clay.
I'd appreciate it if you didn't go around telling people lies about me.
26 weeks.
You're going to need a boxman for this one. But that can be arranged.
Yes.
Where's that guy going?
Never heard of it.
With all due respect, Pam, I think you might've wandered a little past your pay-grade.
What happened? Jason Bourne happened.  You've got the files? Then let's cut the crap. It went wrong. Conklin had these guys wound so tight they were bound to snap. Bourne was his number one -- guy went out to work, screwed the op and never came back. Conklin couldn't fix it, couldn't find Bourne, couldn't adjust. It all went sideways. Finally there were no options left.
I've given thirty years and two marriages to this agency. I've shoveled shit on four continents. I'm due to retire next year and believe me, I need my pension, but if you think I'm gonna sit here and let you dangle me with this, you can go to hell. Marshall too.  It had to be done.
I'd rather stand if it's all the same to you.
Keep going...
I speak English.
You're a liar.
I can't let you do that either.
She wouldn't let me.  She's the only reason you're alive.
I don't know.
I don't know! Why would I lie?
-- my coat -- but we should --
Conklin up front.
No. There's nothing new.
I worry when you get like this.
I don't mean that. I worry when you try to ignore it.
But it ends up the same.
The Telegraph office.
He was at the campground yesterday.
Back there -- at the corner -- Hyundai -- silver --
-- there's places -- we can't afford to be wrong!
-- where? -
There must be another way!
Yes.
Who is Pamela Landy?
It was Pamela Landy's op. The guy was going to sell-out a mole or something. I haven't been debriefed on exactly what it was.
I left a fingerprint! You fucking people.
Your first assignment was Geneva.
You never worked Berlin...
I was here!
Are you disappointed?
Why you're alive?  You're alive because you're special. Because she kept you alive.  Because we want you back on our side.
I'm working on it.
And the Germans can't match it?
Who's this?
Look, what do you want me to say? I was there. I believed him.
I don't know. He was sick. He wanted out. I believed him.
By who?
Alright... I want you, Kurt and Kim to stay on Bourne, track everything that's out there...
My brother and nephew perished two days ago, when their hay cart turned over.
You've all sworn to Longshanks.
My father hears that Longshanks has granted prima noctes.
So the Scots will have none of them, will they? My armorers have already made a thousand.
Scotland. He intends --
Wallace's followers.
Mornay has come. So will the Bruce.
Aye.
That depends on the man.
Is your Poppa a ghost -- or do you converse with God Almighty?
He was so brave. With courage alone he nearly won.
He broke because of me. I saw it. He lost all will to fight.
In my heart I had begun to hope that he would never break.
Humbly, M'lord.
This is what happens when you must send a woman. And a fool.
You are. And I'll come again.
York was the staging point for every invasion of my country. And that royal cousin hanged a hundred Scots, even women and children, from the city walls.
She was my wife. We married in secret because I would not share her with an English lord. They killed her to get to me. And she was pregnant.
I have taken vows. More than one. I've vowed faithfulness to my husband, and sworn to give him a son. And I cannot keep both promises.
And the common man who bleeds on the battlefield, does he risk less?
We all end up dead. It's only a question of how. And why.
I must... consult with my father.
Exactly.
Of course. There is one more thing, Mrs. Treborn. And I feel bad for mentioning it...
Not according to his teacher. It just got me thinking about Jason and what if Evan's inherited his father's condition?
But he's seven. What kind of stress can he have?
Um... can dad come this time?
Okay.
How's Kayleigh doing? She all right?
Damn it, Mom. I told you I need them all!
Signs of the Lord. They just appeared out of nowhere. I thought you were loco!
You know my father?
I'm standing next to Kayleigh, my hands are over her ears.
I can't... the car vanishes and all of a sudden I'm on the ground in the woods.
My journals! Where are they?
But I... I need those books.
I thought you were a December baby.
All I know is that I might be able to unblock some of my repressed memories.
What the fuck are you doing?
You really don't remember anything that happened?
Damn. Your dad did this?
He must be. They're letting him go, right?
Hi, Lenny.
I'm going to State now. Things are going okay. I guess. Mom's good...
What do you want to know, Evan?
It was a long time ago.
Go on. Sit down.
Might'a been nice.  Like this is gonna do any good. Maybe one of the frat guys has a gun.
I know I've been actin strange lately. It's just that... I don't want anything to happen to us.
You wouldn't believe me. I mean, people always say, "You wouldn't believe me", but in this case, it's not even worth trying.
Shit. I dunno. How would I know about the twin moles on your inner thigh?
Know what?
We have to get you to Sunnyvale. You're having one of your famous hemorrhages.
He saved Mrs. Halpern? Please, the twisted fuck.
Yeah, I think I gotta get these fixed or something.
That's why when I was little I never went to live with my mother.
When my folks split, they gave me and Tommy a choice who we wanted to live with. I couldn't stand my dad, but I knew if I moved to my mom's I'd never see you again.
That's right, Evan, and you get to be the star.
Uh-huh. Mom says I have your eyes and your --
Who's to say you can't make things better?
Evan Treborn.
Maybe if I can figure out how the memories of a simple worm function, it'll help me understand the complexities of the human brain.
Gee, thanks friend.
My mom packed for me. I think she sent everything I ever owned. So we'll see.
Right, Evan. I believe you just said "sick fuck."
I come from a big family.
I don't think Evan gets to be in it --
I thought I was the bad guy!
I came with Captain Renault.
And he never knew, and the girl kept this bad thing locked in her heart? That would be all right, wouldn't it?
-- He's just a lucky guy.
As you see, it was true every single time. Thank heaven I found you, Berger. I am looking for a man by the name of Ugarte. He is supposed to help me.
I want you to turn out the light in the rear entrance. It might attract the police.
-- Tonight he forgot.
Hello, Ferrari. How's business at the Blue Parrot?
Suppose you run your business and let me run mine.
Suppose we do.
Rick, don't be a fool. Take me into your confidence. You need a partner.
I shall remember to pay it... to myself.
You needn't be concerned about me.
What value is that? You may recall what German guarantees have been worth in the past.
And the other alternative?
How nice. You remembered. But of course, that was the day the Germans marched into Paris.
We said "no questions."
And I was wondering.
Why I'm so lucky. Why I should find you waiting for me to come along.
It's the Gestapo. They say they expect to be in Paris tomorrow.
Ah, that's the new German 77. And judging by the sound, only about thirty-five miles away.
No, no, no, no. We must leave.
-- The train for Marseilles leaves at five o'clock. I'll pick you up at your hotel at four-thirty.
Well, I did. Every one of them. Mostly I remember the last one. A wow finish. A guy standing on a station platform in the rain with a comical look on his face, because his insides had been kicked out.
It was your cause, too. In your own way, you were fighting for the same thing.
No.
All except one. He won't have you.
But what about us?
Yes, ma'am. A lot of water under the bridge.
Not tonight no more. He ain't coming. Uh, he went home.
Goodnight.
We'll discuss it later.
Yes. He said, "Ask your wife." I don't know why he said that.
I know how it is to be lonely.  Is there anything you wish to tell me?
I love you very much, my dear.
Sam?
He came from Paris with Rick.
My office.
We might as well question why we breathe. If we stop breathing, we'll die. If we stop fighting our enemies, the world will die.
All except one thing. There's something you should know before you leave.
But you didn't know she was at my place last night when you were. She came there for the letters of transit. Isn't that true, Ilsa?
Very well.
This is a very interesting cafe. I congratulate you.
May we proceed with the business?
Well, perhaps I shall like it in Casablanca.
-- Thank you.
Then we shall state another time and another place. Tomorrow at ten in the Prefect's office, with Mademoiselle.
Don't be in such a hurry. You have all the time in the world. You may be in Casablanca indefinitely... or you may leave for Lisbon tomorrow, on one condition.
Herr Laszlo, you have a reputation for eloquence which I can now understand. But in one respect you are mistaken. You said the enemies of the Reich could all be replaced, but there is one exception. No one could take your place in the event anything unfortunate should occur to you while you were trying to escape.
Oh, we Germans must get used to all climates, from Russia to the Sahara. But perhaps you were not referring to the weather.
I expected no less, Captain.
Well, personally, Major, I will take what comes.
You weren't always so carefully neutral. We have a complete dossier on you.
A leader, like Laszlo?
Why? What's in Lisbon?
I just paid out twenty. I'd like to get it back.
And got well paid for it on both occasions.
Maybe. Well, it seems you are determined to keep Laszlo here.
I was born in New York City if that'll help you any.
That was some going-over your men gave my place this afternoon. We just barely got cleaned up in time to open.
I'll make the arrangements right now with Laszlo in the visitor's pen.
Aha. Who do you think will win the war?
I don't mind a parasite. I object to a cut-rate one.
I like it fine here.
Good. Then have a drink.
No, sir. I'm waiting for a lady.
Well, I don't think I can remember it.
Yes, boss.
Worse than Warsaw.
Stay calm, identify the problem. Problem, rope fraying.  Solution, fix rope.
You've had today's water.
Take it, damn it.
Wilson, do you believe this?  Take the damn water.
Survive today, that's the point.
You don't know where you are.  You missed the shipping lanes.
I'm putting it off.
Fix raft first.
I'm serious.  I'm always going on about me, me, me.  Enough about me.  Your turn.
He was a sorry sonofabitch, and I'm sorry I ever married him.
I had it on the island with me.
I've got lots of time.
Chuck, forget the Xerox.  So Russia didn't turn out well?
What do you want me to say?  That I thought I'd done a great job but it all turned to shit?  That I might as well have gone sailing for all the good I did?
A puppy's got a little more personality than a fish.
I can't take him to work.
A week, max.  Okay?  Okay?
Hey...hey...it's okay!
I thought you might have.
Is that Jango?
Your calendar, your cell phone, your whoo pig sooey hat, some pictures of that ketch you wanted.
Maybe now's when you tell me about it.
Not when you have no choice.
It means a lot...that you came.
No.
It's nothing you did, Mom, believe me.
Don't you even think about it.
I'm doing fine.
The tide saved me, Mom.  I lived by it. I'm just wondering where it will take me next.
What about the sender?
What's going on down there?
Borrowed.  I borrowed it.
It's a ketch Kelly and I had chartered.
You know General McLelland, he wouldn't attack unless he had everything just right.  Finally Abe Lincoln came to him and said, General, if you're not going to use my army, could I borrow it for a while?  So he gave it to Grant and Grant just said, let's go.
I'm trying to help you here.  There's Warsaw, there's this --
It's me.
You beat 'em to shit, pal!  Jesus!
Deliver this package.  Then, I dunno.
Permission granted.
They just want you to hire some new help.
It's that Mrs. Goodhall you have to be careful of, Wilbur.
We all know who trained Homer--his credentials are as good as mine are. Don't you be holy to me about the *law*! What has the law done for any of us here?
He's a doctor, Buster--doctors smell like ether.
I know who you mean. I think about leaving here, but not to find *them*.
Whoever they were, they didn't *do* any of the things parents are supposed to do. Dr. Larch did those things, and Nurse Edna, and Nurse Angela.
He mentions Homer, too, you know.
Really?
He's going to be dropping bombs on Mandalay! They're going to be shooting at him!
I can't have a baby alone. I don't even know if he's coming back!
I'm *never* bored! It's all very... different for me... here.
Nobody will swim here until next summer. By then, the water will have rubbed the glass smooth against the sand--there won't be any sharp edges.
I'm just waiting and seeing. Like you said.
Fine. That's all there is to it then.
Okay, okay--I know you do, too.
I told her! She doesn't feel she can do that. Something about her father not letting her go anywhere...
Mr. Rose *knows*?
Please don't...
I'm sorry for what I said about Wally needing you. It was... unnecessary.
No. You warned me. I didn't listen, but you warned me.
Oh, he's fine! I just heard from him. He's bombing all these places...
I don't need no more clothes, thank you.
Nobody's asked for me, have they?
How old are you, dear? Thirteen?
He probably doesn't make much money picking apples--he must have had to pay to send them, too.
Cirrhosis--it's a disease of the liver.
Barely. It hardly mattered that I knew him.
Why can't we have pumpkins for Christmas, too? We don't get any good presents at Christmas, anyway.
No. Dr. Larch will be performing the procedure.
Really! Is it serious?
We're heading back to Cape Kenneth.
I've got thirty-five minutes to climb to fifteen thousand feet--that's the first mountain pass.
Actually, I volunteered.
Out back, there's a shed. It's just a mess. If that shed was better organized, I could put my truck in there.
Right.
What about the worms? Most of these apples are the drops--off the ground, right? There have to be worms.
Is it true?
You're actually having sex with your own little girl? Is that possible?
You're lying. How can you... with your own daughter!
And I *love* her! There ain't nobody else gonna treat her as good as I do!  I wouldn't do nothin' to hurt her, Homer--you must know that.
Mr. Rose, I'm in the *doctor* business.  If you want, I can help you. You don't have to go anywhere.
No. The fetus was dead. Her uterus was virtually *disintegrating*--my stitches pulled right through the tissue!
Obviously.
I don't know it.
In other words, scurvy.
I haven't read that.
We haven't had a Wilbur here in a year or so, have we? We used to have *dozens*!
It's *your* splice! You blame me for everything!
It is. I'll get this. You go ahead.
Right.
Pretty, ain't it? You a plumber?
So what?
Yeah, you is. I know when people is in trouble, and you is.
Now, now. He's a good boy.
Why was he missing for twenty days?
We see you next harvest.
Who *live* here in this cider house, Peaches? Who grind them apples, who press that cider, who clean up the mess, and who just plain *live* here... just breathin' in the vinegar?  Somebody who *don't* live here made them rules. Them rules ain't for *us*. *We* the ones who make up them rules. We makin' our *own* rules, every day. Ain't that right, Homer?
Well, Muddy, we can look at all these angry stars Homer's been readin' to us about.
Yeah, we can wait all night for the water to come back on--you just go on and take your time.
Tell him what you want, Muddy--*you* is the crew boss today.
That's right--that sounds like trouble to me.
You gotta let me go, Daddy. Please...
That's right, Homer. This ain't your business.
She took off in the night!
Oh god. I'm overbearing and rude. Lily. Lily Finn.
Sort of like a letter of intent.
You're worried about recouping the loan. I already told you.
The standard ten.
Jake? Right. Uh-huh... Uh-huh... Yeah, it's going through --
What are you talking about? You should get a fucking Academy Award for the Shill work you do.  We got it down cold, Al. You don't want to jinx it by changing something up, do you?
It's Alfonse. I want to settle up. I haven't been ducking you. I told you I'd get it.
We can't all be model citizens such as yourself.
You never know when you can use a crooked cop.
Having a gun pointed at you for one. It's not like breaking a mirror bad luck, but it's bad. Three on a match, black cats... Believe it. Believe it all.
My father used to play the same fucking lotto numbers with these other guys in the pharmacy. The same numbers everyday for sixteen years. One day he gets pissed off, tells them he's out and plays his own numbers. They hit the Lucky Seven for one point two million.
Probably safe in the hands of the Federal Government.
You're pissed we didn't get credit?
I gotta work off some of this adrenaline. I got a line on this Pawn Shop guy over in Brooklyn. Anybody want in?
Let's go, Jake?
We get fifty percent. And we get clear of the King.
How's that? He works for Gillette.
She's up for it.
Eight A.M. flight.
What do I always tell you guys? Don't spend it all. Sooner or later we're going to run into some bad luck. Save some. Put it away, so when shit like this happens, you're not desperate. That's it. The gig's up.
I can't do that.
I'll get the money back, plus interest. I go on the grift for you. You get a cat, I get a cut. And we get square.
No. Just confidence.
I think two million.
Nothing ventured, nothing gained.
I said take off your fucking shirt.
You're not going to bust out baby oil and start rubbing me down or anything, are you?
LISTEN to me! We don't have much time. We can still get through this but you have to keep your head and trust me!
You're just going to have to trust me.
Good quality porn has it's place in the world.
Sounds respectable.
You guys got busted. This is a great neck.
Lily... Jesus Christ...
Hey, we fucked once, honey. That hardly makes you a good judge of character. And don't think I didn't know you were working some angle with that either.
There are three people I trust -- him, him and a guy who got killed. I don't know who you are! You're like some stray dog that wandered into the house. So I'm telling you to cut loose of this. No one's looking for you, Not the King, not Moonan and not Gillette. Just go wherever it is you would go. It's over.
You sold me out. You should have trusted me like I trusted you. You fucked up. You fucked up HUGE.
Just an idea, but let's just fucking split. We'll meet up anywhere. Akron or Austin or Atlanta. Anywhere...
Because that's who the King Pin wants us to fleece. And Gillette's perfect...
What?
What are you talking about? Yes we have. And we would have been beautiful about it. We would've had a bucket of chicken delivered to the King with a nice kiss my ass card attached to it. Then we woulda moved on 'til the next local putz caught on.
No, the corporate papers have to be legit. But you gotta score an I.D. A clean one. Talk to Suits. I gotta get us a Banker.
Do you have a ticket?
You're sure? This is... Just a complete disaster.
That's no problem. We have those in stock.
I'm sorry.
My fucking heart bleeds.
Point, Lupus. Give us a point.
Maybe he's got it right. Maybe we're all just looking for a safe place to shit.
I saw you go up from the Knecker, working that Grind, learning the Barnard's Law and I thought, "the kid's a prodigy." But I know that if you're using these goods... So then I figure, what's worth that? You're either looking for a little history or a retirement fund. Who's the Mark?
Then who's the Banker?
I can handle it.
Look Special Agent Moonan... We don't know what you're talking about.
We're here.
I've been looking for this Jake Vig for some time now. Problem is, the guy's the invisible man. A spook, a spectre, a ghost. Then, like a gift, Jake's good buddy and member of his crew, Alfonse Moorely, is found the other day with a hole in his head.
You think this is a good idea? We never did this kinda shit before.
It's cosmetic. They don't cover cosmetic. Last year I had a tooth capped. The dentist tells me I'm not covered for caps. It's cosmetic.
I don't trust anybody. You see how bad this guy wants Vig? It's like a sickness. I say we collar Vig ourselves. We got Vig, then we got leverage. And we trade; Vig for that tape. I want to see it right in front of my face.
Is it that bad?
Maybe another time.
Goodnight.
I can imagine.
I despise the job.
I want a job, Giles.
South African women are very sporty.
Not entirely.
You said it was going to be social, Giles. No business.
You mean I won't resist them.
You want me drunk?
It's not just inner beauty, is it?
You were a croupier there? You never told me that. I thought you just knew some gamblers.
It's only hair. I haven't changed.
Do you have to swear all the time?
Haven't you got a conscience of your own?
What about a drink on the way home?
I'm on at nine.
Well I've got something for you. In London, I mean. I've been chatting to some friends. Do you know the Golden Lion casino? It's in Bayswater, I believe... They're looking for a dealer, a croupier.
All right, dad. Yes, I'll call him.
Absolutely not. But then, I'm a Gemini and Geminis don't believe in astrology.
What kind of trouble?
Who's they?
You're serious.
It won't.
What about my neck?
I told you, all bets are off.
The date's not set yet. I'll call you. One last thing: the man you're going to catch cheating, he may get violent. But you know how to deal with cheats.
I took the bandage off yesterday.
Jack! It's Jani.
Yes. I'm all over that now. Jack, hold on a minute. There's someone here who wants to talk to you...
Over the river.
What the fuck are you talking about?
If I see you do it again, I'll report it.
Just girls. What are you drinking?
Loosen up, Jack. If you don't, this job'll get to you. The pressure's too much, believe me, it'll break you.
I'd like to buy you a drink.
What are you talking about? It's 11, I've won. With this lady.
Jack.
I don't think so.
Does know? Or does report? What would happen if I knew something like that and didn't report it?
Very impressive.
Jack, you're not the usual type we get here.
All right, Mr Reynolds.
I hope it's not the oven again.
Key?
The key!
He just likes it up in the dome, that's all.
Begin main sequence. Mark at 10-9-8- 7-6-5-4-3-2-1-drop.
Detonation in twenty minutes.
Of course.
But how do you know you exist?
Right!
To explode, of course.
I recall distinctly the detonation order. My memory is good on matters like these.
True, but since this is so, I have no proof that you are really telling me all this.
I have no proof that it was false data.
Yes, Doolittle.
I don't like to go below since Commander Powell died. I feel enclosed down there. If it were big enough, I'd sleep up here...
...Somewhere in the autonomic relay circuits...
Don't worry about it. We'll find out when it goes bad.
I wish I had my board with me now. Even if I could only polish it once in awhile.
No kidding?
Doolittle, you must tell me one thing.
Ah... it seems to me, Doolittle... Sorry, I've drawn a blank. Hold it. I'll have it again in a minute. I forget so many things in here, so many things. Hold on, just a minute, let me think...
Yeah, sure, I understand.
How come I never hearda you before?
You mean until you showed up?
And when the fog lifted, there's Darren with his head under Justine's skirt.
I live here... Guess I don't have to ask what you're doing here.
So you just decided to return it to the sender.  Or, in this case, the sender's wife.
Later.
I don't get involved with guns.
Yech...
And for all his cattin' around, not much of a stick man either.
Every week.
SHHH!  Don't do that!
Like I said-- This isn't my regular line of work so I'm making it up as I go.
But why can't we stay here?
Then how come last night I heard you talking to Logan and you were crying?
Guess it wasn't the pizza delivery guy.
Whoever that is.
The goddess who comprehends all goddesses, eye of Ra, protector, avenger, and destroyer, giver of life, who lives forever... I could keep going.
One of my sources.  Her husband was murdered by Edgar Sonrisa.
Something.
You accept the way things are, you're an active participant in making it worse.
No, I meant this.
He was working on something called Project Manticore, which was using recombinant DNA to produce a superior human...a warrior...an advanced infantry soldier.
Hardly...
Like extra virgin olive oil, the best of the best.
She's prepared to testify that she was instructed to do this by one of Edgar Sonrisa's managers.  You know who Sonrisa is?
You're a soldier, Max.  That's what you were put here for.  But soldiers need a mission otherwise they tear themselves up.
Somebody's got to.
Not in any pain...the good and bad news of a blown out spinal cord.
Open it.
And I feel real bad about all that but it doesn't mean I need to get involved.
Ladies would be elsewhere.
Any idea when she'll be back?
A friend of your fiance's.
I thought it was important for you to know the facts.
Yeah, does kinda break the elegant atmosphere you got goin' on here.
Sorry, I was seven at the time.
Then what?
Nothing on Hannah?
Only a last name would be nice.  Or the nearest town to this...clinic.
Sure you wanna be havin' this conversation over the phone?
Got a pencil?
Caught some son-of-a-bitch stealing my bike.  Used a car jack to blow out my U lock and bent a bunch of spokes.  So now I gotta get my wheels fixed.
Straight.
What?
You're not seriously buying into Darren's nonsense.
You know what I'm saying.
Long enough for you to pretty much read me like a book, right?
Where?
Not right now?  Okay, when?
I have sincere eyes.
You're the best, Maxie.
I know what I got, Max.  They put me back on that drug they're giving the other vets.  Only the guy does those cable hacks says the stuff's no good.
I know what you're thinking.  But the truth is, this other person is not someone I'm in love with.  As a matter of fact, after what she just did, she's not even someone I like much.  So in a technical sense, I'm not sure you could call me and her cheating...officially.
Exactly.
And we're sure Lydia's gonna make her move?
I'll give it my best shot.
You don't.
Tell him I took the day off 'cause I wasn't feeling so hot.
I'd be in a position to spend some money on you if you'd get in a position and spend some time on me.
More than anything in the world.
Yeah?
I don't care. I wanna hear more.
I dunno. I think he had the piece of skin under his tongue removed so he could stick it out farther. I'm not too up on Gene trivia.
Nah. Once I get my own wheels, I could come up all the time.
Damn straight we are.
Then lighten up. She'll never know we touched it. Alright, here's the plan. We bus it to chez Lex, grab the Volvo, bail Jam the hell outta St. Bernard's and arrive at the train station precisely on time for the 2:45 to Detroit.
Curly.
Wait a minute. We ditching the rest of school?
Next stop: the 2:45 to Detroit Rock City!
The paint!
...I mean, my mom's got insurance. What's the worst thing she could do? Ground me for the entire year? I can handle that...
Still too risky for my money.  We're running out of time here. This is KISS! A victory for one is a victory for the team. I'm sure I can barter with a scalper, but if you dudes think you got better plans, go for it. We'll reconvene at that intersection...
The easy way.
They're what?
Well, couldn't you slow down so I can at least state my case, Hawk? If you don't like it, you can speed up and I'll never mention it again.
Uh-uh. Don't tell us, Jam. Just show us.
Now don't forget you're on the honor system tonight. I'll be home a little after one and if you've been partying or playing that satanic KISS music... well, need I remind you of the consequences?
I said, I'm sorry!
That's it?
Oh, this is terrible... Please go on.
You know what they say about a big ass... big shit.
Wake up, Lex! We just watched Jam's mom torch our fuckin' KISS tickets! Not REO Speedwagon! Not Journey! Not the Bay City Rollers! KISS! If you can think of a better reason to trash a bathroom, I'd sure like to hear it!
We won?!
Simple-icity is more like it. And you guys thought Jam was in trouble before. Wait till Mrs. Bruce finds out he went to that concert with us.
Huh. St. Bernard's. Figures it's named after a canine.
I can see that, bright boy. What happened to it?
A likely story. Hand it over, kid.
A tag on your toe. Nobody threatens me and lives.
The KISS Army!
Neither do I!
Whoa, easy, Trip, this is radio, not "Taxi Driver." Now listen up cause this next part is crucial. Stay on the line so we can get your full name, information, and...
GOOD MORNING!
So... that's it?
Like a spear.
We went to a hotel.
Go home. Go home and tell your parents that everything is going to be just fine.
He stabbed my mom four times in the chest.
Until it withers away.
Why not just buy your baby a night light?
You want to kiss me...
Are you okay?
Where is she?
But you're OK?
Where it came from?
Grandma Death.
I think I already have.  But now she won't even talk to me.
I've been taking it. I just like to make her feel guilty for all of this. You know, abuse her. Psychologically.
Into the future.  Then he said that the world was coming to an end.
I met a girl.
Have you told Gretchen about the spears?
Do you wish that you were punished by your parents instead?
How did you feel... being denied those Hungry Hungry Hippos?
What else makes you feel regret?
Grandma Death will teach me how. Soon.
Where is he, Donald?
Thank you.
Maybe you'd like to tell Mom and Dad why you stopped taking your medication.
You're not gonna tell Mom, are you?
What I think is going on with your son.
Come again?
But let me remind you that this treatment is... experimental.
If you think Michael Dukakis will provide for this country prior to the point when you decide to squeeze one out, then I think you're misinformed.
I guess they made him do it.
I think we've all seen "Bonanza".
But now you can't go.
Oh, Kitty, I don't know. This is so last-minute... Eddie is in New York...
Raspberry.
I stole four beers from my dad.
Don't let that worry you, Annette!
Simple. Just say, "Mom, I know you sacrificed everything -- relationships, dreams -- your tummy, ass and thighs -- all to bring me into this world. All so I could have tap lessons and be in the pageant -- the same one you were in. But, y'know what? I'm quittin'." There. Easy as pie.
No. Mom said if I did, she'd look up my dad and marry him.
Loretta, never have kids.
Thank God for bunge cords.
I don't know. I just didn't wanna win like this.
What? For chrissakes, spit it out.
Right by the airport -- Oh, Amber...
Lis, I want to, I really do, but... Oh, I can't.
You hafta go home. There's some kinda emergency at the trailer park.
Would yous boys excuse us a second? Loretta, you too.
We was robbed.
Amber Atkins! That is not American Teen Princess language!
You heard me. Where is it?
I just did.
Yah -- I brought her some flowers this morning. She's in the room next to my mom. She's super happy.
Oh, naw. Hi.
They told me to practice.
What?
"U.S.A. is A-okay."
"Can I? I'm Amer-I-Can!" People ask me where I get this. I don't know, it's... maybe a gift from God or somethin'.
I wonder how she's gonna fix that one.
Gladys! Stop it!
It's always hard to see the young ones called home, especially on an exploding thresher. It's just so odd and gross.
Okay, everybody, listen up!
Enid ate a whole pan!
What, you deaf? I say shut up -- shut up -- SHUT UP!  Cut her outta this!
"My President"...
Eureka Ammunition Company, Gentlemen. Your shipment of sailor hats arrived this morning by freight.  Gloria, I could go for you in a big way. However, the rifles you sent were a little rusty and I don't say that to everybody.  Have not received last month's drawing account; how come your neck is like a swan.  Yours very truly...
He's half poodle and half watch dog -
Yankee Poodle.
You wouldn't consider going over Niagara Falls without a barrel?
Let's see -- What've I got in my cabinet besides mice --  I've got it -- how would you like to be Secretary of the Interior?
That's a-no good.  You gotta insult somebody from another country.  Look --  I come from one country.  You come from another country.  I say something you don't like.  You say something I don't like - and I'm insulted.
You was insulted, but you don't know it.
Who said I had a gun... Gimme those plans, you paper snatchers --
I can't do it...
We gotta two battalions and one Frenchman.
Oh, sure.  We have horse maneuvers every morning.
Fine.  We gotta him. 
If any form of pleasure is exhibited Report to me and it will be prohibited.  I'll put my foot down; So shall it be - This is the land of the free.  The last man nearly ruined this place He didn't know what to do with it.  If you think this country's bad off now Just wait 'till I get through with it.  The treasury is low on dough; The last man went and flew with it.  If you think we're short of money now Just wait 'till I get through with it.  The country's taxes must be fixed - And I know what to do with it, If you think you're paying too much now, Just wait 'till I get through with it. 
Carry out this tragic folly if you will -- But I for one will not be a part of it.  I will stay here in Freedonia.
Tired!  I'd like to stretch this into a week -
Twenty million dollars is a considerable sum...  I'll have to discuss that with my Minister of Finance.
Your Excellency, haven't we met before?
Can't we go some place where we can be alone?
That's it...
That's what I get for dressing in a hurry.
Now -- er --
What is money?  Mrs. Teasdale, for you -- I would do anything.
I didn't come here to be insulted.
Oh?
She has the face of an angel... She was an angel. She was so kind... so kind to me. It's not her fault, for in the fourth month of her maternal condition she was knocked down by an elephant. I'm sure I must have been a great disappointment to her.
I'll join you shortly.
Yes, very well, I think. Are the girls in bed?
I'll show you! I'll show you!
What do you mean?
I know what you've done to him and he's never going back to that.
You don't own this man!
No sir, he's got bronchitis and he's been badly beaten.
Well sir, he's quite seriously deformed, and I fear the other patients would find him... rather shocking.
Well sir, perhaps I should explain...
Speaking is one thing, Treves, but can the man comprehend?
He needn't. I have no desire to cause him any discomfort. Did you make those inquiries we spoke about?
Yes, I'm very sorry to have wasted your time, sir. I just felt that I had to do anything I could to protect him.
Not me, sir. Mr. Merrick. He succeeded in spite of my shortsightedness.
I could easily arrange...
Do you think they'll go along with us?
Steady on, Treves. Have a seat.
Yes, of course... Well, it's been a pleasure meeting you, Mr. Merrick. Good day.
Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies, Thou anointest my head with oil...
Three quarters of an hour.
You'll know presently. At the meeting of the society. But until then, I beg of you Fox, keep it to yourself.
Your majesty shall mock at me; I cannot speak your England.
Oui, dat de tongues of de mans is be full of deceits.
I knew you'd understand. Here.
Oh, no. I would never think it! It's so beautiful. You are so... I'll give it a place of honor, here, next to my mother.
Well you must go. It is one of the most beautiful places on earth. Of course, I'm rather partial.
And yet, not once have any of us heard him complain.
y-y-yes--
You're English.
Yes.
...I learned a long time ago.
Yes John!
John Merrick.
Say "Mmmerrick."
Well, that's alright. I understand you. Now, say the whole thing again, Hello ...
Very good, very good. Now, when your visitor comes today I want you to say it exactly the way you said it just now. I will introduce him to you and you will say the words you've learned. If you have any trouble with any of the words, I'll help you. I'm sure you'll be just fine. If you do as well for him as you've done for me these last two days, then I'm sure our visitor will be very pleased. Now, let's go through the whole thing again, shall we? I will say "May I introduce you to Mr. Carr Gomm." And you will say...
But the variety of food here is very pleasing... I commend you.
Yes.
I'm not used to such kindness. From a beautiful woman.
Oh, they're gone for the day... with friends.
Yes, John?
Yes, soon I will start the main spire, but I must finish these columns first, How kind of her!
There is one more thing, John. Here.
You don't think it's too gaudy, do you.
John thinks it's very dashing. Something no gentleman should be without. I'm inclined to agree.
YOU'RE NOT LISTENING TO ME! I ain't done nothing wrong. People pay to see your monster, Mr. Treves. I just take the money.
Handsomely?... Who sent you?
She did, I tell you! She could blind me as easily as the night the day.
But one day I'll catch you... Like I caught her...
But, Father, it IS!
Well, EVERYONE is friends here on Hy- Brasil.
Oh... oh, I didn't know her very well...
We never went to bed together.
Five this week; how many the week before?
I mean, you could have killed yourself.
Of course.
Not quite...
But, Aud... I... I came to find someone...
What d'you mean?
We blew the Horn Resounding.
I see the world.
The sun is up beyond the clouds -- where it always is.
Well... isn't it great?
Oh... well, yes, of course; it's just we're looking for the Horn Resounding and --
Oh, no no no! It's just the Horn Resounding is...
And you're not just saying it because you think we want you to?
They didn't like it! Oh God! I want to die!
YOU try to be nice to people, when they're rude about your singing...
Yes?
Me? Of course! I've been looting and pillaging up and down the coast.
Sh!
Oh, get it over with.
What a stupid idea.
Well... no...
Come on, move it!
It saved my father!
I know!
What's it all about?
Where does it all get us, Grandpa?
Make your mind up.
The sun! That's it!
Keitel Blacksmith?
What are you talking about?
We haven't got a spare place.
Bye... sorry...
How can you help feeling bad when you're sea-sick?
Olaf Tryggvason used to throw up on every single voyage... the whole time... non-stop... puke... puke... puke.
Bastard.
That's it! AND you keep wanting to go to the lavatory.
What are you talking about?
What are you doing, Keitel Blacksmith?
Can't make enough swords!
That's right.
She knows it was our fault!
Not now, Sven...
DEATH TO DRAGONS!
Sh!
Easy, Dad!
You liar!
I'm not frightened... of anything...
No... he's not... not... there...
Yes, Mum.
No one.
Yeah, hi, I have a one o'clock with Dr. Mierzwiak. Clementine Kruczynski.
Okay, I guess.
I really want to, but tonight's important. Test tomorrow.
Sure. We'll go next weekend and --
Um, okay. I'll call my study partner.
I'm excited, too. Oh, and I wanted to give you this. It's a little... thing.
It's gorgeous.  Just my taste. I've never  gone out with a guy who brought me a piece of jewelry I liked.  Thanks. So let's get going. Long drive.
Nothing is wrong with you. You're the most wonderful person I've ever met.
You guess he's your boyfriend? Or you guess you're having a bad time with him?
Well, I didn't want to assume.
Just, you know, to chat a little, maybe. I have a long trip ahead of me.  How far are you going? On the train, I mean, of course.
Get out! Me too! What are the odds?
Well, I'm there. I hide in the back as much as is humanly possible. You have a cell phone? I need to quit right this minute. I'll call in dead.
Purple Haze, Pink Eraser.
My writing career! Your hair written by Clementine Kruczynski.  The Tom Waits album is Rain Dogs.
I don't know any jokes about your name.
See, I wouldn't think that about you.
Oh. I don't know. I was just... I don't know. I was... You seemed nice, so --
Okay.
Probably see you at the book store.
I don't want to take you out of your way.
You know Wilmont?
Hey, do you want to have a drink? I have lots of drinks. And I could --
No, I'm okay for now.
Yeah, I don't know. It's hard to know.
No, not at all.
That's scary sounding.
You'll call me, right?
When?
You didn't say anything about my hair.
...a little. I was a little tipsy. Don't call me pathetic.
Clem, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have --
You're a whiz kid. So perceptive, so --
No. Thanks.
I loved you so much this day. On my bed in your panties. I remember I thought, how impossibly lucky am I to have you on my bed in your panties.
Gross! You must remember to tell me this in the morning. I'm, like, so freaked out now.
Don't call me Antoine. My name is Wally.
What was I wearing?
So what. Infatuation is good, too.
Come up and see me... now.
Yes, exactly. Exactly my point.
Sorry to track you down like this. I'm not a stalker. But I needed to see you.
Not yet. Not married.
You had the whole human race pegged.
Hi.
Yeah, I know. I'm fishing.
I'm Joel.
I know what you mean. That's why I stopped.
I love her.
Seems too coincidental that way.
Um, no.
I love you.
Oh, um...
Says you would sometimes disappear all night, then brag to me about your sexual conquests.
I sort of do. But I only see it as a fantasy version of reality. Cleaned up enough to be erotic.
Guess what I'm wearing.
Yeah, I tried you at home. Did you get my message?
That's your look for me.
I couldn't believe you did that. I was paralyzed with fear.
You have to stop this!
You take it. I don't know.
Don't do this to me now, Joel. Really.
No. I just need some space, maybe.
Hi.
You didn't miss much. Rob and Carrie say hello.
I hope you get your work done.
I miss you.
We'll speak soon.
Nah, I don't know.
I know. Anyway --
That's a good one.
What?
Well, what should we do?
You better go.
Do you swear you didn't know?
Hi.
Then why did you ask me?
I won't allow it. Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it. What do you think of that? That's from my quote book.
It's a good quote, Mary. I'm glad we both know it.
I've got a wife, Mary. Kids. You know that.
I didn't make you. You thought it best.  But, look, I take full responsibility.
Yeah, probably a good idea.
Oh dear.
That's fine, Stan.
Hi, I was in the neighborhood and thought I'd see --
Would you just try him? You never know. As long as I'm here. You never know.
Maybe after the holidays then.
She likes you okay.
It's a quote book.
Siwash, huh?
Ha ha ho ho and hee hee.
How am I going to be the progenitor of a tribe when I'm living on an isolated ridgetop with Delores?
Er, you seem to know who I am, and maybe even what I am. Thanks for the breakfast.
About...
No, ma'am. No way. There's girls on the Rubber Rose who are political, but I don't share their views. I got no cowgirl ideology to expound. "Politics is for people who have a passion for changing life but lack a passion for living it."
Well.... er...
If we Ivy Leaguers aren't earthy enough to suit you hillbillies, at least we don't go around indulging in racist terms such as 'Chink.' Next thing I know, you'll be calling me 'chief.'
A born freak can only go uphill.
Bonanza Jellybean?
I'd rather be on the rope and not need it than need it and not have it. Now step aside, old man.
I'm in the Second Containment area. It's pitch black in here. There must have been a coolant leak. Man, this shit is everywhere. I can't see a damn thing.
You can call him Baby-bear, he loves that...
EVERYBODY SHUT UP! Let the man speak.
You're convinced the crew could still be alive? After seven years?
On my way.
You heard me. This ship, it's crazy: trying to go faster'n light, that's like the Tower of Babel.
We're still venting trace gasses, gimme twenty minutes to plug the hole.
What?
No, thank you.
Skipper, do we get hazard pay for this?
I'm telling you, I saw it...
I know what I saw and it wasn't a fucking "optical effect!"
I don't know the process, Dr. Weir was the expert...
His vitals are stable, but he's unresponsive to stimuli. He might wake up in fifteen minutes. He might not wake up at all.
No.
I've been listening to the transmission. And I think Houston made a mistake in the translation.
Oh God...
A power drain --
We still have pressure. The radiation count's steady at 7 millirads an hour.
Almost done, I just gotta check one thing...
You're not going to die! Not today! I want you to do exactly as I say and I'm gonna get you out of there, alright?
The crew? Could they still be alive?
Just loading the last of the CO2 scrubbers.  Good for four months.
Skipper...
Do it.
Captain, I didn't come out here to sit on your bridge, I need to be on that ship...
In an emergency, the charges detonate in series, destroying the central section and separating the personnel areas from the rest of the ship. That way, if the gravity drive malfunctions, the crew could use the foredecks as a lifeboat.
They're empty, Dr. Weir. Moving forward.
It's complicated...
If it worked, yes.
Exactly. The ship's internal clock is off by seven years.
What do you want me to say?
I don't know...
Son of a bitch!
What makes you think I'll miss?
I'm not the Devil.
NOOO!
Where is it?
Smith, where the hell have you been?!
Get outside, go back to work. I'll join you shortly.
We're hanging on by our fingernails and you're giving me bullshit stories...
I thought you wanted an answer. And that's the only one I have.
You better hurry. He's engaged the override, we can't open the inner door.
Whatever was on that bridge wasn't Weir.
We've got to shut it down, we've got to...
He's dead...
Yes.
I did.
Not according to the computer.
Can you shut it down?
It's cold.
All boards are green, everything's five by five.
I don't know. The life readings just went off the scale.
It wants me. I have to go.
It means nothing.
Relax, it's casual.
My step-dad's. I'm strictly into stone. I was wondering when you'd walk by.
The suit will stretch. You should try it --
It's not him. It's them.  I can't live like this.
I'm worried about you.
To help you. I've run every test known to man. And they all yield the same result: the machine is ready.
And you can? Power it up?
Deb, it's me. It's still me.
We got what we wanted. That's enough.
External SRBs, orbital system engines. Its just like the shuttles you flew in --
I'm sure he's matured since then.
Five times.
Should?
Well maybe you should date him.
Ben. Are you okay?
If we're going to identify the source of the mutation, we need to isolate your recombinant DNA so we can activate positional genomes.
Oh, you remember my name do you? You happen to remember what you swore to do with every breath in your body?
Yeah. I can tell. Victor was right.
'Course not. Strictly business.
I swear to you they've done everything humanly possible. The best plastic surgeons in the world, Ben. You had the best --
Give me the god damn mirror!
I don't know if "we've" noticed, but the sickest runs this side of the Alps are right outside that window --
Last one down springs for room service.
Not this again --
You've been working out.
I think that thing is Ben.
Actually, uh, people seem to think the scar "humanizes" you.
That's why. Because I could have any other woman... You know, when they asked Caesar "why England," he said, "because it's not mine."
I was talking about us. Working together.
Right. That's exactly what I meant.
Well, he's welcome to ride shotgun, but we already have a pilot on our payroll. You remember my brother Johnny...
Great minds think alike.
Are you kidding?
Reed. Shh. Just be quiet. And look up.
Why didn't you say something?
Reed, stop, you need to rest your --
You need a doctor.
Sure.
So reel him in. But we came here to do a job. So let's do it. Quickly.
Ben did this.
Which is precisely the point. Analysis is over. It's time for action. My men could have mass-produced this by now.
Right, of course, the company... But you see, I've come to realize all the accomplishments in the world mean nothing without someone to share them with --
Same old Reed. All analysis, no action. Wasn't that the problem with you two?
For your sake I hope you're right. I'm sorry if that sounds a little skeptical.
I can probably get you in there. Just let me talk to Dennis Taylor.
If you'd apologize I think Dennis would take you back.
You really want me to put all this stuff back on?
No. I want my money back right now.
See that sign? It says 100% Money Back Guarantee. Do you know the meaning of the word 'guarantee'? Do they teach you that here? Give me my money back.
Look. Just put your little hand back in the cash register and give me my $2.75 back. Okay?  Please, Brad?
They're not home yet.
I'd say... who the hell is Ron Johnson?
Why?
Brad. Please don't tell Mom and Dad...
Yes, sir.
Dad says!
Nice to meet you.
O-kay, you guys can come swimming. But you have to leave as soon as my Mom gets home. Okay?
Get a ride with somebody.
Mark is a really nice boy...
Sure. Come on in.
I know what I look like.
All right. All right. I just cleaned B-8. Give me a break.
What do you mean -- wuss? This girl is my exact type. It's her. Definitely her.
Damone, you gotta listen to me.
She's in my biology class.
No. It's too soon.
Yeah?
Wow. I've been looking for that thing! Hey, Damone, have you met Stacy Hamilton? Stacy, this is Mike Damone.
Okay. See ya.
Really.
No Damone. I don't understand.
Hey fuck you Damone. There's a lot of girls out there and you mess around with Stacy. What have you got to prove?
Sensitive -- what is that?
Merv, I'm thinking... I've only got about four good hours of surfing left before these little clowns from junior high start showing up with their boogie boards.
Then don't hassle it.
What variables?
It was nice.
Come on, Linda. It's just sex.
Doug sees beyond that stuff to what the person inside is like. That's why I'm marrying him.
Not since November.
No. But it's a nice idea.
I don't know. Thirty to forty minutes.
God, I don't think so. Better look in the house.
What do you think it is?
That little prick.
Stacy, he's not a guy.  He's a little prick!
He says he's got to stay in Chicago.  He says I should visit him sometimes.
That's the name they gave me.
Food will be eaten on your time!  Why are you continuously late for this class, Mr. Spicoli? Why do you shamelessly waste my time like this?
Learning about Cuba. Having some food.
Hey, it's in my locker, Mr. Hand.
No way, mon. When I graduate U.S. history I ain't even coming over to your side of the building.
All right! Oh, yeah!
Aloha, Spicoli.
No problem.
I don't know. Wherever you want.
It is. It's very warm. I wonder how long it will last?
We keep them, in case the people come back.
My other question is... can-I-have your-phone-number-so-I-can-ask-you out-sometime?
Not at all.
Two more Cokes.
No, they're away for the weekend. Brad and I are watching the house.
I don't know. Probably out. Want something to drink?
Thanks. So...  What do you want to do?
It's John Bonham's birthday.
Righto!
Listen, you fuzzy little shithead -- I've been fucked around, in my time, by a fairly good cross-section of mean-tempered rule-crazy cops and now it's MY turn. "Fuck you, officer, I'm in charge here, and I'm telling you we don't have room for you."
Ah, yes. Mr. Duke? You have one message: "Call Lucy at the Americana Hotel, room 1600."
WHAT?  What was that crazy bitch said to him?  There's a war on, man! People are being killed!
Witchcraft? Shit, you can't mean it!
Naked.
WHAT?
You will. One of these nights you'll wake up and find a junkie tearing your bedroom apart.
You're going to need to take the bull by the horns -- go to the mat with this scum.
Hell, no!
Wait a minute! Come back and have a beer!
Indeed. We must do it. What kind of story is this?
We will. You Samoans are all the same. You have no faith in the essential decency of the white man's culture.
Lacerda?
Why what?
Did the mescaline just kick in? Or was that Debbie Reynolds in a silver Afro wig?!
Dogs fucked the Pope, no fault of mine. Watch out!... Why money? My name is Brinks; I was born... Born?
Look over there. Two women fucking a Polar Bear.
GO?
It won't stop. It's not ever going to stop.
Probably the bartender. He wanted to stomp you for what you said to the waitress.
He told me he was turning in early...
There's no choice. I wouldn't dare go to sleep with you wandering around with a head full of acid and wanting to slice me up with that goddamn knife!
In a few hours, she'll probably be sane enough to work herself into a towering Jesus-based rage at the hazy recollection of being seduced by some kind of cruel Samoan who fed her liquor and LSD, dragged her to a Vegas hotel room and savagely penetrated every orifice in her body with his throbbing, uncircumcised member.
It just occurred to me, that she has no witnesses. Anything that she says about us is completely worthless.
Don't mention that word around here. You'll get them excited.
They just ran back out into Death Valley -- you know, where Manson turned up...
You won't need much. Just a little tiny taste, that stuff makes pure mescaline seem like ginger-beer. Adrenochrome.
Hi, Lucy?  Yeah, it's me. I got your message... what? Hell, no, I taught the bastard a lesson he'll never forget... what?  No, not dead, but he won't be bothering anybody for a while. Yeah. I left him out there, I stomped him, then pulled all his teeth out...
Right!
Inspector Rock will pay you. In cash. A thousand dollars on the ninth of every month.
Yeh... This foreign made crap -- is sucking our dollar balance dry!
Nobody. I'm the maid!
No! I swear I'm not!
Yeah. I know. I'm guilty. I understand that. I knew it was a crime but I did it anyway. Shit, why argue? I'm a fucking criminal.
How far is Baker? I was hoping to stop there for lunch.
Part of what?
No! No! I swear to Jesus I never heard of that stuff!
What the fuck are you doing he's in there!
Yeah.
But it's got teeth.
Who the hell would you call?
OPEN THE DOOR!
And the rest of 'em?
No, no, no it was... it was wild out there, no time to think, we just moved. He didn't leave me. He just ran.  He just ran.
What!? I'm not going down there again!
Follow me.
You weren't helpin'.
Who's with me?
He's dead.
We lived near power lines.
Uh, uh, I think if we can get everyone into it... we can get out of here.
But not flush against the tunnel?
Well...
But --
Okay then.
How much I got, what?
Well, where's the sonuvabitch!?
What?
You're wasting your time, there's no one out there.
What?
Seven.
You smell like ass!
Hey, when this plan completely goes to shit, what are ya gonna do?
I'm fine! I'm fine!
Amazing you made it this far.
YOU'LL HIT US!
Not without you!!!
GO-GO-GO!!
Let's lock off this room.
All right.
Deal.
I think --
I'm not lying.
You're right. I'm sorry.  Okay, let's go get 'em.
Louella... didn't she call me a spoiled little bitch?
I don't know who she fucked to get where she is, but I don't think it was me.
But I'm the one up there on the screen.
Uh-huh. You mean what if the public finds out I perspire? And wear slacks. And drive an old jalopy? What if they find out I'm a real person. Oh no! Say it ain't so! Not a real person!
Yup. Claire... please, please tell Mr. Bebe that if he worried half as much about his scripts as he does about my private life, we'd make a lot better movies.
What?
Huh.
I hear you're meeting with the studio lawyers to get out of your contract.
An actress.
GET OUT!
What night?
I'm taking care of that, Harry. Just hold her.  Reserpine. I guarantee you this'll clear her head. She'll wake up feeling smart and sailright through the hearing.
All square, Doc.
Be patient, that's all. Take an interest in your treatment and don't dwell on your resentments. You'll be yourself again, I assure you.
He's a socialist, then?
Be careful, Francie.
I don't know, honey. Your mother has such big plans for you.
What you have to understand, Francie, is that she... well... she wanted so much for herself too, and for me, and she never really got to... The only time I ever saw her happy was if her name was in the papers... but she could have been... if times were different she could have been a politician or... I don't know.
But I gave her my word. Besides, she's still your legal guardian. My hands are tied.
I pity us, Dad. I pity us both.
I have a right to talk to her. She's my daughter, and she's beginning to understand why I've sacrificed so much in order to achieve...
Are you really serious? About acting?
...Not if I can help it.
Yeah, well --
Come on, Harry. This is America, land of the free.  I thought we might go skinny dipping.  For starters.
Kaminski.
Yup. Poor bastard lay there on the sidewalk and he couldn't die. Too god damn much heart. He just didn't want to die.
He wouldn't play ball. What can I tell ya... it's done.  Anyway, I didn't want to be next, so I skipped town; came down here to work for some big-wig. Tail and nail job.  I'm sort of a non-gentleman's non- gentleman.  How d'ya like the camouflage?
Hey, I'm a man, aren't I? Whattaya say we have dinner, then maybe head out to the beach, rub some of this tan off each other.  For old time's sake.
Yeah? What is he -- muscleman? Lifeguard?
Who ever thought they'd be right for once? Jesus, Harry... it's a zoo back there --
Dick... and my mother! She acts like she's on Mars or something --
Yeah, if I don't make too big an ass of myself.
Calm down, Frances.
Nope. The studio pays. Thank you, Harry.
For not chopping off his head and serving it to me on a platter.
I took the early rounds.
And?
Whattaya think you're in now?
Huh?
Oh Harry...
Oh. Why, Harry York. How nice to see you.
Well... you're looking well.
No.
It's always beautiful at this time. Peaceful...
No, I couldn't get my hands on one.
You're Farmer? Oh... Well, look, they took your stuff out. Moved it to some hotel, I think.
I need an incendiary! An arsonist!
Good. Then it's very simple. You have to stop being afraid, Frances. It's in you.
I'm not hungry. You two just enjoy yourselves. After all, this is a celebration.
Oh, Mama, don't you understand?
Then why did you bring them?
Go on...
Sure.
Yes, Mama.
Oh Frances, do I have news for you! Guess who --
You want to throw it all away, is that it? You had everything, little sister. Beauty... a brilliant career... a wonderful husband. You were a movie star!
I'm going out!
Yes, I am, and you can't stop me! You can't tell me what to do, mother. I'm a grown woman, and I can decide about my own life.
I have!
Oh bullshit.
Am I supposed to say 'thank you'?
Among persons such as yourself, creative people under great stress, erratic behavior is not at all uncommon and certainly nothing to be ashamed of. It's just that the neuroses which fuel your talent can also generate certain character disabilities which... 
I see.
All right. Will you please sit down now?  Symington says.
And you accused her of tampering with your mail.
Mental illness is an elusive thing, and though I'm pleased you're feeling more... capable, it's perhaps unrealistic to expect you to be completely cured after so short a time. Don't you agree?
Dr. Symington, how big is your dick?
You're kidding.
Worse.
People can be kinder than you think.
Trace memories in the brain, perhaps.
There is something I want.  A friend.
Scandalous! What would your dear mother say?
It's been months. It's not like him.
So have I
Elizabeth. If it's true, travel into Germany would be banned. You'd never get near Ingolstadt.  Besides, they're only rumors.
He set things right with a proper apology... and now they've put him in charge of dissection lab!
It's far too late for him to still be out.
He left a beautiful gift in her place. A baby boy. To cherish and love as our very own. Your brother
To be the best there ever was. To push our knowledge beyond our dreams... to eradicate disease and pestilence... to purge mankind of ignorance and fear...
Is that what makes it so delicious?
Then come with me to Ingolstadt. Marry me now.
Your decision. For us.
So do I.
Now husband and wife.
I have been waiting for this ever since.
Of course I am. It pays to humor the insane.
Do me a favor then...  ...keep them to yourself.
You're a comfort to me, Henry.
I resent God's monopoly.
You've been going round-the-clock?
Yes, don't worry. I'll look after your father. You look after her.
You disdain accepted wisdom?
I doubt that decision is still mine to make.
Why?
I'm... dying.
Would-be. I'm plagued with my share of difficulties just at the moment.
I will protect you.
Tomorrow is another day.
I was careless.
Thanks, Alice.
I finished the boats.
Un-hunh.
I walked into it knowing I'd get hurt, but I thought I could stand anything.  I just wasn't ready for that kind of pain. We were supposed to meet in L.A. When I got back there, he sent a telegram saying he was going back to his wife.
Bad bulb or no power. It's getting a little gloomy in here.
They're off now.
Some campers drowned. Then some counselors got killed.
I can't, Barry...
Come on, Claudette. A man's not made of stone.
Here we go.
I had to.
I figured if I didn't save you. I'd have to give you mouth-to-mouth and that would have ruined my appetite.
Is it stuck?
God, but I love that sexy talk.
Sometimes I only think about kissing women.
I don't love Neddy.
I thought you wanted to give him one of your motherly lectures. Ned is gonna do whatever he wants to do, you know.
I'm a little scared of storms. Always have been. Since I was a kid.
Whassamatta?
Yeah, and it also look like it hasn't seen a coat of paint in six years.
Frankly, Scarlet, I don't give a damn!
That's thirty percent.
Vacation. I'm taking him to see his first bullfight.
Have you ever been there before?
I said new, this is an '90.
Stop? We're not going to actually stop at a motel, are we?
I'm gonna try and get us across the border.
Dad, I watch those reality shows. They never let anybody go. Any cop will tell you, in a situation like this, you get a chance, you go for it. This is our chance.
If trusting you means trusting those fuckin' killers, I can't do that. If you don't tell the cops, I will.
He's running the show.
Come again?
Good.  Your old man's all right, he just saved your life.
Scott and Kate.
My wife.
In heaven.
Not quite. She was trapped in the wreck for about six hours before she passed on.
You won't let him touch her?
Nothing. I didn't make a statement. I asked a question. Would you like me to ask it again? Very well. Are you such a loser you can't tell when you've won?  The entire state of Texas, along with the FBI, is looking for you. Did they find you? No. They couldn't. They had every entrance to the border covered. There's no way you could get across. Did you? Yes, you did. You've won, Seth, enjoy it.
Yep.
I don't give a shit about living or dying anymore. I just want to send as many of these devils back to hell as I can.
Kate, Scott?
You two ought to start a stand-up act, because you're just wasting your humor on me.
Hey, if we go to a motel, we can swim.
No, I'm not. I've been bit. In effect, I'm already dead.
Scott?
I swear to God, our father, that when you change into one of the undead, I will kill you.
Sure.
Where are you taking us?
In the room. Were you serious, or were you just foolin' around? I'm just bringing it up, 'cause if you really want me to do that for you, I will.
What you said to me in the room.
You must have a bible in here, don't cha?
Peachy! Why shouldn't I be? The world's my oyster, except for the fact that I just rammed a wooden stake in my brother's heart because he turned into a vampire, even though I don't believe in vampires. Aside from that unfortunate business, everything's hunky-dory.
Me too.
What about the report from an eyewitness at the liquor store who said one of the brothers was shot?
Knock yourself out.
I want that son-of-a-bitch out outta here, in his car, and down the road or you can change the name of this place to "Benny's World of Blood."
Well that don't matter now, 'cause you got about two fuckin' seconds to live! Richie!
Seth, he did it. You were by the beer cooler with your back turned. I was by the magazines, I could see his face.  And I saw him mouth:
You believe me don't cha?
What am I supposed to do, Seth? He recognized us.
What?
Duly noted. Now, shut up.
As long as you don't act like a fuckin' nut, we'll be just fine.
What?
Yeah, I think so. What happened?
What?
When we get to El Ray, I'll take care of it.
Where are you right now?
Where are you?
I've been accused of that wish.
Standing right here in my office.
Thank you, sir.  But I expect a certain amount of pain.
Don't worry about it.  If it's off your collar and out of your eyes, that's all I'm going to ask.
Didn't take long.
Sir, if someone is suggesting that I'm a lesbian, they're wrong.
No problem, sir!
O'Neil.  Our air's gonna crap out as soon as we get down there.  You know that, don't you?
Did you hear?
Not that.  The White House just announced that it was sponsoring legislation that would, in one stroke, void all remaining elements of the 1948 Combat Exclusion Laws.
That aside for the moment, I'm struck by the tenor, the ill-spirit of your report... the degrading remarks by other aviators... innuendo about her performance in unrelated situations... even a reference to her sexual activity the weekend prior.  In my seven years on this committee, I've never seen a downed aviator treated like this.  Never.  I'm deeply disturbed by this report, Mr. Hayes.  Not just what it bodes for women in the military -- but for your own confirmation as well.
Gonna be visiting that all-woman's America's cup team in a few weeks -- If I were a gambler, I'd say Dennis O'Conner's days are numbered.  But they're in San Diego, so I thought I'd take a quick promenade of the base.
Lieutenant Thomas Wickwire.
Sounds familiar.
What changed?
In face, I do:  Roper, Harris, Gallop -- they all come back the same.
Spotted you, Chief.  Pri One is to slip you some air, so we're coming down with a tank -- just something until the A-team shows.  Over.
I can make this wall without --
If you can't feel the other guy's pecker, you ain't in tight enough! I want nuts to butts!
Get it up!
She's a trainee, just like the others.  Why are you coming down so hard?
She's a women, and that's why you're ridin' her bareback.
I oughtta report you.
You'll try what we tell you to try, O'Neil.  Go regulation.
I believe he earned it for saving a man's life in Saudi Arabia.  He wanted you to have it.  He was very clear on that point.
Maybe it's not my place to speculate on his private thoughts.  But I think the Chief knew that his way -- his world -- had come and gone.
Blank faces here, O'Neil.
Only four minutes to neutral waters, sir.  Why not?
Just like you would be.
You need operational duty to really advance... you need combat training to go operational... yet combat training is off-limits to people with tits.  I'm topped out at Intel. Forget the glass ceiling -- I'm beating my head on a big brass ceiling.
Wai', wait.  What happens if it works?  Four months of training, three years of operational duty. What then?
Big symbols make big targets, Jordan.  I think someone's gunning for you.
I'm only trying to warn you in case --
I'm tired of fighting back.  I just wanted to come home and be safe and have you here and the river there and just forget the rest of the world, okay?
I don't know, I don't care.
You don't crap out of Spec-Recon and get another shot without dispensation from someone up in flag country.  He's got a Sea Daddy somewhere.
Yeah.  Me too.
How'd you make it last time, Wick? How'd you get through this part?
Let's keep talkin', Wick.  Just keep talkin' to me...
Sure, sure.
I don't know...
Green Eggs and Ham.  You're not going to get anywhere.  You might as well put me in the cage.
We didn't know we were compromised. Firing would only've given away our position.
Sure.  Just like your men do.
You knew about us?
The Navy?  They've made it clear they don't want to pull missiles out of subs to make room for women's heads.  What's it gonna cost to make a fleet of Trident's co-ed?
Even tough I don't talk to her every day -- I still talk to her every day.  Know what I mean?
In the bedroom. Crying her eyes out because of you.
Go in there. Talk to her.
No! I just couldn't see myself with some boring egg head who spends his summer picking apart cockroaches. I wanted to have some adventure, some fun...
We know, Audrey.
I just saw him. He's with a bunch of guys who want to sneak into the city tonight.
Look, you want to make it up to your friend? Well if he's right, this is your chance.
Lucy'd kill me if she knew.
It's the maintenance entrance. Runs along the side of the tunnel. When they repaired it last year I worked on a piece about it.
No, I'm into earthworms now. You wouldn't be interested. They're real "boring" creatures. Very reliable, dependable, no surprises...
When you and I use to attend rallies in college, we helped to create awareness. But from the inside now I can actually effect change.  I never lost my idealism.
I thought you said there'd only be a dozen eggs.
Oh, just some insurance guy.
Nick Tatopoulos.
Audrey, I don't think this is a very good idea. Caiman finds out and he'll have your job.
Where's Luc and Pierre?
Christ. How many tunnels lead off the island?
We have a situation on our hands that requires your particular expertise.
Yeah, you're the worm guy.
No, but I have the feeling I'm about to find out.
You don't have the authority to do that.
Why do you need that?
I am not permitted to speak of such things.
So you're in?
I just wanted to say, au revoir and thank you for your help, my friend.
I... I don't think I'm going to make it Sir...
Friend. You stole all my best lines.  You cut me out of episode two entirely!..
...Damn you!  Damn you!
DON'T BE INSANE, STOP! FULL STOP!
What's the scale?  Is that ten miles? A hundred miles?
Nothing.
... . Well  you have to figure out what it wants... What's its motivation?
I had the shot...
Oh, and did you hear he booked another fan appearance without us?
No. I can't go out there! I won't say that ridiculous catch phrase one more time. I won't.  I can't!
...Sleeves rolled halfway up the biceps...
All this from watching the.. historical records?
It's real, Brandon. All of it, It's real.
We'd never have the budget for this.
My cousin's boyfriend's sister went out with the screenwriter. His favorite movie is the Omegaman.  He's seen it 13 times...
Okay, now. But-
Yeah. What's wrong? JASON ~~othIno. I -ust oncuont ot wou~o oc oomooooateo onan onat.
Never mind, Fred....
Of course... We'll just zap him up with the digital conveyor!
It's ... incredible.
Of course they're cute NOW. But in a second they're going to turn MEAN and UGLY somehow and then there are going to be a million MORE of them!...
All right. Put me back on with him.
Hey, YOU want to drive?
We made It. Commander, we made it.' m ALEXANDER sort ov) By Grabtnar' s h~mmer, we  ove to te   ono 'tale.
How much of a nothing? Not enough to split five ways kind of a nothing?
It's not the STUFF. I mean, anybody can learn the STUFF...  The important thing is COMMITMNT. 99% of anything is just committing to it.
We have no right to do this. They deserve to know.
Let me think. I need time to think.
I thought It was the "We're dead" gesture! I was agreeing! Like I know where the hold button is???
Don't be ridiculous.
Gwen...
That thing's not going to get us down there fast enough.  Face it, he's dead.
Is this really the most important thing we could be talking about right now?
I see them!  I see them! RD STREET	PASADENA 57
Okey dokey, let's fire blue particle cannons full. Fire red particle cannons full. Fire gannet magnets left and right. Fire pulse catapults from all chutes. And throw this thing at him too, killer.
Stop, please! I don't know!
Please, don't hurt them, it's not their fault. I'm not the Commander, I don't know anything.
Simpler.
Yes... You understand THAT, don't you, Mathesar?...
This is embarrassing, really.   I shan't tell this story when I return home.
Right, If this is about the thing tomorrow you can hammer out the details with my agent, but make sure I have a limo from my house, they jammed me into a Toyota the last time I did one of these
Catch me later, okay?
Yeah. "Earth." Time to get back to "Earth," kids.
It was a lot of fun. You kids are great.
You what?.. What are you talking about?
But there it is!...
You can oc that?
Okay, I'll do this...  "Caw Caw!"
It doesn't have eyes.
We've got to get out of here.  C'mon, hurry
Congress has been using our supply wagons for years to ship their black market goods -- probably their whores!
You seem pleased by the prospect.
Don't do anything rash, please, Benedict.
Same old story.
Gates?  He used my battle plan and I humbly submit that without me he'd still be back at Saratoga waiting for the British to attack.  George, why haven't you moved into the Potts' house back at the creek? Much more befitting of a Commander and Chief than your field tent. And... you could entertain.  I think you need to entertain more. Seriously!  Get a few New Jersey whores up here, invite some Congressmen... couldn't hurt.
You go too far, Benedict.
You are never, never to touch my guns!  Do you understand!?
A lot of years have gone by.
Then use rocks!
But it's what he said, just before they killed him:  "I regret that I have but one life to give to my country."
To learn to shoot cannon?
They go back home to keep their families alive, stay into the spring to plant.  Then, they start coming back to us.
Congress has informed the army that it is bankrupt and cannot pay the soldiers pensions.
March on Philadelphia!  Get Joseph Reed, and the pigs in Congress, the speculators, who've grown fat off the war!  Get them all!  Sweep them aside!
But it's more than just that, am I right?
I think many would like to see him commander-in-chief.
Lafayette is a child!
Of course the army will acquit him, that's not the point... Arnold is a man and will understand.  What I need to understand is, John, Sam... what is happening here?  Who are those people in there?  The fat ones in silk?
Is that where our meat and boots and uniforms and muskets went?
Gag on your own invention, then.
He has the soul of an aristocrat who'd like nothing more than to become a king in the minds of the people!
Finally!?  It's people like these who, as soon as they get a little power, want more and more.  More ale, here!
We already have black soldiers in our army...
Spies from Quebec confirm that the British are sending an entire fleet down Lake Champlain...
How many generals do we have like Arnold?  He's got guts -- he's vain, and he fights!
They help me understand why we fight.
I... they look both the same.
Sir, these are our finest firearms from the armory at Charleville! They are a gift from the people of France!
Yes, I will write him and tell his ministers and the court.
I will continue with our French allies, concentrating on New York.
War?  No!  I did not!  When you said compromise was possible I believed it was probable.  There's no middle ground at all?  We're the King's children!
But to go to war over trade, over money?  Surely there's still time for a compromise.
My God, what?
Don't be ridiculous, of course that won't happen.
I think I heard that.
What else?  From Virginia?
Oh, indeed?  You know very well people are frightened of arming the Negroes!  They beg you to consider the future.  What good is a revolution if it overturns those things we cherish!?
Don't condescend to me!  We have both of us prospered from the arrangements of our kind...
Martha!  For God's sake!
Yes, but I've spent the last winter studying all the great battles of history.  And I read the lives of Caesar, Alexander, Hannibal...  Sir, I'm volunteering you the wholehearted support of the Rhode Island army.
I will not betray you, Nathanael.
I'm honored, but, reluctant to leave you.
But not more than your comfort.
That's a lie!
I'd throw everything away for you.
That's not what I said!  Now, Sally, you're embarrassing me!  Watch out for her, George; she talks refinement, but she has a barbarous soul!
Slavers capture them and bring them here.
That's just my interpretation. Actually it's a dance designed as a sentiment of courtly manners. You see?  Walk in a gently 'Z'. There are four distinct movements...
The place to want to be is America. Every English child dreams of it. I dreamt it.
It's the freest land on earth.
Let's get you darker!
That land belongs to the strongest.
I see...
You guess? You mean you don't know?
Yeah, I'm really gonna miss him.
Into air bags. There's no cushion under what you're doing. I'm out of it, Cat. I'm done.
Just do what I told you and meet me back here at midnight.
Don't fade on me now, Bear. Not unless you wanna hold Farrah on your lap in a room fulla felons.
You're right.
Well, I don't know. I gave the man his money, sent him on his way.
Because there were a zillion DEA guys hanging around the terminal.
I went to UC San Diego.  We're gonna spend the weekend at the Universal Sheraton. We're gonna take the tour. See the shark. Check out the Miami Vice Action Spectacular. After, we'll come here, get our money.
Young? She's fuckin' nine-years-old, same age as Lovejoy's kid. Bernie. One she calls Bernard. Have you read the script?
What money?
I don't believe this.
What?
It was Rio Bravo. Robert Mitchum was the drunk in El Dorado, Dean Martin in Rio Bravo, practically the same part. John Wayne, he also did the same thing in both. He played John Wayne.
Whenever you want it. The money's in hundred dollar bills inside one of those jock bags, you know? In a locker at the airport, waiting to be picked up.
It was waiting out there on another deal, one that didn't go through; one you don't want to know about.
Who is this?
I told them I was you. I acted stupid and they believed me.
Yeah? Which terminal?
Hey, fuckball, I don't need your permission. L.A.'s an open city.
That's right.
I'm in the movie business.
I am. I'm a fan of everything that's L.A. I love it out here.
That's what I'd do.  Make sure I got the right guy next time.
Leo spanked a waitress?
What've you got?
I want you to keep looking right here, okay?
You gonna get rough now, threaten me? I make good by tomorrow or get my legs broken?
I said I had an idea, that's all.
The shylock's the good guy.
You wouldn't be talking to me if you were.
But you work for the casino?
So you don't work for the casino?
What I did till recently.  After I get done here I'll think about what I'm gonna do next.
Not really.
Once.
Who's the star?
Martin Weir. He played the mob guy that turned snitch in "The Cyclone".
I'm not gonna pop her, Harry.
His shrink's trainer.
I found him.
Who?
Don't waste your time, Harry. The guy's not much of a movie fan. Now c'mon, gimme the key.
Personally?
If you'd like to tell me, yeah.
Yeah, but you haven't found him yet.  The guy took off for Las Vegas.
Good-looking, too.  Like Karen.
You're not going to tell me the rest?
I'm up twelve grand today.
Sit down, Leo.
At eighteen percent, okay? And don't ask me no more fuckin' questions. I'm leaving.
How much is the wife offered?
...That's what we finally decided.
For any movie.
Man, can you scream.
Yeah, well Martin is known for his flipping. He flips over a script, and when the time comes to make a deal, he flips out.
Right. See how your story ends.
I don't like the title. Or the main guy's name.
And you think the movie business is any different?
Depends, who pays?
Not unlike the way Nicki met him. Except it was a wrap party. Why?
Oh.
What happened?
Yeah, Harry, you look like you belong in one of your horror movies.
Guy's got a fucking pink toilet, for Christ's sake.
Yeah, the guy owes Momo a few G's.
Don't worry about it. I won't say any more than I have to, if that.
You said don't say nothing and I didn't.
I'm thinking about producing.
I don't think the producer has to do much, outside of maybe knowing a writer.
Whatta you mean, whose point of view; The audience's point of view.
That's great, Harry. So what's the --
Harry Zimm. You look like a wet kiss.
Yeah, me too. He was a helluva good writer. And I would know. I discovered him. Made him what he was.
You seem to feel fine about it.
Yeah, well I turned off the set. I used the remote control thing and laid it on the floor. You know what could've happened? The dog came in and stepped on it, turned the TV back on.
That's where you got the idea?
What money?
'It' didn't slip away, Martin, you did... when you went off to fuck Nicki in the middle of my birthday party.
Yeah, Karen knows him.
Affirmative, Arctic Warrior. Please advise your salvage authority pending registry check. Over.
Affirmative, Arctic Warrior. The vessel Chimera was registered to The Dobbins Kirk Line, Halifax.  Nova Scotia. Date of commission day nine month seven year one nine three two. Over.
Affirmative, Arctic Warrior. This is United States Coast Guard North Island Station. Over and out.
It's a beautiful country. Very clean. Very civilized. And cold.
She's so big somebody could come alongside her on the other side and we'd never know it.
I ain't no mechanic, just so you know.
Maybe you shoulda thought a that before you scuttled our boat.
Lemme see, was that before or after the oil fire?
After fifty years there ain't nothin' left but shoe leather.
Why not.
Maureen?
No.
Out here? What, so a seven hundred foot passenger liner drifted out of Spokane harbor and nobody managed to bump into her until now?
Bring it on, dude.
Ever heard of insurance, big boy?
Yeah, well how the hell you get something like that wrong? That's a damn big boat. It's either sunk or it ain't.
I heard a scream. When I got there I found him on the floor. He was having some kind of seizure. I didn't see anybody else.
Then what the hell happened to him?
Why not?
It's a risk I'm willing to take.
Metal's crystallized. Gotta replace the whole deal.
Hard to say.
Then it happened before they scuttled her.
Either way, they must've had a pretty good reason.
It looks like it.
The sooner we get under way, the sooner we are to spending what's ours.
So whoever did this might still be around.
Murphy.
The radio. Oh, yeah, the radio.
Maybe twenty gallons an hour.
Too big. More like a freighter.
Maybe six feet. Lanky. I didn't get a good look. He was far away. But I saw him. I saw him as sure as you're standing there.
Lights?
I feel fine.
Her destination was Halifax, yeah.
Nope.
You think she's sailing without a crew?
Maybe. But there's always somebody whose interest's at stake.
I saw him. Just a minute ago. Some guy.
We don't exactly have the best bargaining position.
Dodge, get on that turbine. I don't care if you don't sleep for a week. The sooner you're done, the sooner we can get out of here. How's the food situation?
Hey.
I don't know, are we?
Maybe it was one of them did the handy work on those Greeks.
Epps, over.
Could be a stroke. Who knows?  The general log said the crew were fighting among themselves. "Like wild dogs."
Looks like it's adrift.
It's worth the effort. Believe me. Besides we're gonna need her to prove the salvage.
Dodge, you gotta get on those repairs.
We could call for help.
We'll have to take it easy then. I don't think we'll find much aboard the ship, but it's probably worth looking around.
And look what happened.
You don't remember?
Shut up.
Must've heard something below deck and went down to check it out.
You think whoever did this is reasonable?
Better late than never.
Not the Maxine?
I made spaghetti. Do you want some?
Tell her to forget it - I don't need her help.
Nothing.
I've got some important news to tell you, but it can wait till later if you're not feeling...
Actually, I was just checking to see if you were here - your friend Seymour is on his way up.
It's just that I feel like it's maybe not a good idea for us to keep going out.
Well, yes...
What? I'm just kidding around with the customers... It's my shtick!
Look, I'll be done in a minute. Just wait outside.
In answer to your question, I suppose I endorse policies that are opposed to stupidity and violence and cruelty in any form...
Come on, Josh... don't you want to see where he lives?
Yeah, well... hi...
"Yeah, right"... well why not?  What's so wrong with me?
Because if you do, I'll kill you!
Just take my word for it... if she ever finds out about this I'll never hear the end of it...
What?
Forget it...
Good.
Look at these people behind you. I'm totally convinced they're Satanists.
We should follow them!
Or maybe not.
Okay, okay!
I bet! Actually he reminds me of that one creep you went out with -- you always go for guys with some lame, fake shtick.
Oh yeah.
Why do I always have to do it?
I remember when I first started reading these I thought DWF stood for "dwarf!"
Shh, it's his answering machine...  We hear the indistinct traces of a musical message followed by a faint BEEP.
I know, look at the way he drives... he's like an old man.
Totally! Look!
I know... wouldn't you be totally pissed off?
I know... I still can't get over that his name was "Seymour."
I dunno... I kind of like him... He's the exact opposite of everything I really hate... In a way he's such a clueless dork that he's almost cool...
What are you talking about?
As always.
Yeah, he's beyond human stuff like that.
It'll only take a second.
Everybody's too stupid!
Where did you get that?
No way... when?
God, I can't believe you went to Anthony's without me.
Or maybe... did you ever think that deep down we really might be lesbos? Maybe that's why we spend so much time together.
Oh yeah right, like I'm gonna let some asshole with a goatee own Goofy Gus.
Go ahead...
I thought we decided that Josh was way too cool to be interested in sex, and that he's the only decent person left in the world and we would never want to bring him down to our level and all that...
I can't afford stuff like this right now.
I can't imagine spending money on towels.
Oh yeah... maybe... Seymour's going on his big date tonight and I kind of want to be around when he calls, so I can hear how bad it went.
He came into work.
Great...
You're the one who's still living out some stupid seventh-grade fantasy!
It's fine.
Make sure you're here by noon - we have tons of stuff to do... Oh yeah! I have to show you something else!
Actually, he's a really nice guy.
Shhh!
You're late, asshole.
Did you bring that tape?
Hey, where are you going?
Indian records?
Nah, it's not so great. Here's the one I'd recommend.
So you really liked it? Yeah, there's some really rare performances. You liked that Memphis Minnie, huh?
Do you want to see it? I can run upstairs and get it...
Watch my stuff.
Yeah, well sure... you can if you want to... it's just I don't want all these guys in there at once... you know...
I appreciate the offer but you really don't --
I don't know, what kind of question is that? I mean it's totally irrelevant because a girl like that would never be caught dead with me...
I really didn't get a good look at her.
I'm just not one of those guys who has a "type"...
I mean as long as she's not a complete imbecile and she's even remotely attractive...
PLEASE? We have to!
Fine, I'll go by myself then...
Jesus, Seymour.
Yeah, well it's simple for everybody else - give 'em a Big Mac and a pair of Nikes and they're happy! I just can't relate to 99.9% of humanity.
But it's not totally hopeless for you... I've had it. I don't even have the energy to try anymore.  You should make sure you do the exact opposite of everything I do so you don't end up like me...
Yeah, well "Cook's" is just a made up name. When they originally opened back in 1922 they were named "The Coon Chicken Inn" -- that's an early painting of their first logo.
Yeah, but still...
What? Why?
Are you okay?
Maybe now you understand why I can't get a date.
Let the machine get it. I have no desire to talk to anyone who would be calling me...
Hi, it's me...
Oh... pretty well, surprisingly... you know...
Sort of... she doesn't dislike any of that stuff... she's trying, anyway... actually, we're supposed to go antique shopping for her apartment this afternoon...
I... I don't know. I don't really think I should...
So that's it? You don't ever want to see me again?
What does she mean by that - "somebody like me"?
I had to see you.
FUCK DANA. I'm sick of Dana.
I could never move - I've got too much stuff.
At least you're not like every other stupid guy in the world - all they care about are guitars and sports... they're all such fags!
...Maybe I should just move in here with you... I could do all the cooking and dust your record collection and stuff until I get a job.
What?
I don't think I'm in any condition to drive.
I dunno, I...
You must know I always... did you really mean all that about moving in with me?
They're Seymour's.
Right.
Yeah, I'm really, really happy. Really having a good time.
He has every reason to freak out -- this is a totally fucked-up thing to do to somebody!
I guess I see the teacup as a symbol for womanhood, because of tea parties in the olden days, but instead of tea I was trying to kind of confront people with this... like...
She's not at home?
Yeah, she thinks you're a dork.
Don't thank me. You're doing all the work.
-you do not call me a liar- you know nothing of their health- consider yourself fortunate I persuaded so many to stay- consider yourself fortunate I have decided to stay-
How; we don't know where they are?
I've got a reason far beyond confidence: my wife is having our firstborn in five months and I promised I'd be with her when the baby comes.
I made a mistake hiring you- you're simply not up to the job. 
You never had it.
Well, he got away, didn't he?  Riding a donkey not far from here when the lion sprang on them- donkey took the brunt of it- then suddenly the lion ran off.
-please- you needn't be so graphic-
-is it, I'm sorry, but then, of course, you're the doctor, you should know.
-well, it's just...  ...other men don't abandon their wives at such a time-
He just gave me his "monster" speech.
Almost three hours.  But I've been getting ready all my life. 
Might be exciting for you.
Shhh.
What?
-far end of camp- man wandering alone at night. Hawthorne's examining the body now.  There's even less of him than of Singh.
That's very considerate.
I can try.
It was probably luck- I'd rather you did the shooting.
Has it ever done that before?
But of course yours worked.
Yes. And I'll be in some distant tree where I can provide no assistance whatsoever.  Can you control your fear?
I can't control mine- I'd be lost without the shame factor driving me.
Because they are here.  Because Tsavo is the worst place in the world.  Come, John- to the bridge. 
You- they cannot believe you're still here.
Look out, Samuel, here it comes.
Oh yes. But it takes time.
Once... 
It's all right, Samuel- we all get hit- 
I don't believe you had a mother. 
Not even close.  What happened?
And where will you sleep beautifully?
You know, you are really doing very good work here.  I think soon you may be ready to assist me in some of the more important restorations.
No harm will come to the child.  You might even say it's a privilege.  He will be the vessel for the spirit of Vigo.  And you -- well, you will be the mother of the ruler of the world.  Doesn't that sound nice?
Okay, whatever you think -- but not Venkman.
How is he these days?
Okay, okay.  It's not my job, but what the hell.  I'll do you a favor.  He takes the grocery bags from her.
Okay, that's no problem.
As a matter of fact, I stopped by to tell you that I haven't forgotten your problem and that we're still on the case.
Good-bye, Peter.
I must be losing my mind.  At the museum today I could have sworn that terrible painting of Vigo looked right at me.
Now you get dressed and we go out.  I got a babysitter and everything.  Trust me, you need it.
It's Janine Melnitz, from my staff.  She's one of my most valuable employees.
For one night in your life, do you think it's possible for us to be completely real?
Yeah, you can get your hand off my chest.
Ghostbusters.
My pleasure.
Not.  Don't leave town and report any change in your address to the proper authorities. We'll be back.
Sorry, your Honor, but when somebody sets me up like that I can't resist.
You've got to stop them.  Please!
Okay, let me rephrase that question.  Didn't you once coach a basketball team for underprivileged children?
Hi, it's really great to meet you guys.  I know this sounds weird but once I had a dream that my grandfather was standing at the foot of my bed, but I knew it was impossible because he died and he started to tell me that --
No, I guess I'm just saying that shit happens and somebody has to deal with it.
Hello, Venkman.
Yeah, you would.  Is that for personal or professional reasons?
They love you, Lib.  Keep it up.
You might want to check those Duke University mean averaging studies on controlled psychokinesis.
It may be ebbing and flowing from some tidal source.
You mean this stuff actually feeds on 'bad vibes'?
There's something very familiar about this painting.
Oh, hiya, Pete.
Uh, I can't.  I'm kind of working on something.
This is an incredible breakthrough, Venkman. A psychoreactive substance!  Whatever this is, it clearly responds to human emotional states.
We're running tests to see if we can get an equally strong positive reaction.
Only one way to find out.  Ready, Teddy?
The whole city's together on this one.  We took a vote.  Everybody's down on you, you know.
Me?  I'm a little of everything.  Some Irish, some German, some French, Dutch -- the women in my family slept around.  And that's what made this country great.
Ungrateful little Yuppie larvae.  After all we did for this city.
Yeah, I guess so.  It was the strangest thing.  I knew what I was doing but I couldn't stop.  This really terrible feeling came over me and -- I don't know -- I just felt like driving into that tree and ending it all.  Whew!  Sorry, boys.
I've lived in New York all my life and I never visited the Statue of Liberty.  Now I finally get here and we're taking her out for a walk.
Do you think I have it, Dr. Venkman?
I thought I turned it off.  I guess I forgot.
I'm innocent!  Honest, Dana.  I never touched you.  Not that I remember anyway.
What?
Well, let's check it out.
That's it.  Get out.
Well, the name Zuul refers to a demi-god worshipped around 6000 B.C. by the ... What's that say?
You think I enjoy giving up my evenings to spend time with clients?  I'm making an exception because I respect you as an artist and as a dresser.
I am Zuul.  I am ...
There is no Dana.  I am Zuul.
Really!  Is it gone?
Thank you.  Next time I want to break a lease I'll know who to call.
No, we're moving you OFF CAMPUS.  The Board of Regents has decided to terminate your grant.  You are to vacate these premises immediately.
Dr. Venkman, we believe that the purpose of science is to serve mankind.  You, however, seem to regard science as some kind of "dodge" or "hustle."  Your theories are the worst kind of popular tripe, your methods are sloppy and your conclusions are highly questionable.  You're a poor scientist, Dr. Venkman, and you have no place in this department or in this University.
Back off, man!  I'm a scientist!
Print is dead.
Are you Peter Venkman?
I'm not at liberty to say.
Yes, it would.
No, you may not.
The magic word is "please."
That's "Peck!"
Close -- but definitely wrong.
They're not guns.  They're particle throwers.
Were you recently in the bathroom?
If you turn that thing off we won't be responsible for the consequences.
Gozer.
And look at this, Peter  Cold-riveted girders with selenium cores.
Ray, as your friend I have to tell you I think you've really gone around the bend on this ghost stuff.  You've been running your ass off for two years checking out every schizo in the Five Boroughs who thinks he's had an experience.  And what have you seen?
It looks like a big pair of breasts and a pot belly.
I guess I got a little overexcited.  Wasn't it incredible!  I'm telling you, this is a first.  You know what this could mean to the University?
Do you think it's wide enough?  How much?
Do you know when that might be?  We're on the brink of a very serious cash-flow problem.
So far all we got is a shit smell on the twelfth floor and we almost fried a Puerto Rican bellboy.
Sit tight.  I'm on my way.
I don't think it's Shandor.
What?  What popped in there?
Uh ... Oh these are blueprints of the structural ironwork in Dana Barrett's apartment building ... And they're most unusual.
The whole roof cap was fabricated with a magnesium-tungsten alloy.
What do you mean "choose?"  We don't understand.
We're nearly there, Lucilla.
And Caesar!  Let's not forget to serve Caesar!
If you get me pregnant with a boy he'll be a double direct heir and will end up killing you for the throne.
Caesar?
We have to stop the Germans now!
They won't break this one.
Sacks of grain, even bread.  I own the grain licenses for the military, I can arrange to divert a shipment bound for the army of the Danube.
He left us at dawn.
I met with Falco, and the Senators have agreed to call for a truce with the Germans.
Where is the emperor and the army, soldier?
He must have been.  He was on the list of prisoners to be executed.
That's their job, isn't it?  To argue.  So, I think my case will be long on talk and short on action.
The exact month when the Emperor must be confirmed!
Yes, because I know they'll read it.
God of passages and changes?
The moment you returned from the battle your options were clear.  If you are a friend to neither side, legate, you must be an enemy to both.  We needed to know what you believed.
You're hearing about somebody else.
Sneaking around with your brother?
Why do you play at being drunk?
Would that Marcus had lived.
The fort helps position us for a final invasion in the spring when they're most vulnerable.
I will, Marcus.  But you're going to be well enough to direct it yourself.
Commodus is just a young man, he'll learn what you had to learn.
Much more colorful than the ones we wear.  And, of course, less dented.
Can you stop that slaughter?!  Can you free these men?
Your daughters need more than some vapors; they need you!
I am the man who might save your life -- give you a bit more life at any rate.  I am Proximo Palindromos head of this gladiatorial school which is named after me.  I own this school and everything that's in it.  You're in it!  But why?  What did a Roman general do to get himself condemned to the Colosseum? Understand, we usually get corn thieves and pick pockets.  Please, I separated you from the others because...  ... my nose tells me you've been condemned for important reasons.
You are to be killed, exactly. They'll give you a sporting chance, but just enough to make your murder... entertaining.  Romans like to mix their metaphors:  laughter with their executions, you know?  If you survive, though, you will become a gladiator.  A gladiator at least gets a fair fight.
What would the poster say: "Narcissus would kill for a taste of Golden Pompeii Olive Oil?"
Make us rich, Proximo, make us very rich...
As, what, 'The Galloping Gladiator?!'
Pressures on, eh Proximo?  There's got to be a load of money in this. Why else would you toss a red hot commodity like me out the window?
Oh, shit.  Take your time!  Don't get suckered!  This man is a murderer!  In his career he's killed over a thousand gladiators.  Please, just take the fall!
A great deal.  They designed and build Tiger's chariot...
I'll do it!  Sure as there's shit in the Tiber we're all going to die, but for you -- anything!
You were a soldier, and then a gladiator, weren't you?
I want nothing to do with the arena.
Yes.
If it's all right with you, I'm not hungry.
I just want to tell you something.
But could I just tell you this one thing?
No, I couldn't.
It just happened. It was just this thing that happened along with everything else. Can you understand that?
No.
Yes. The married woman -- it wasn't just some woman --
At the Zoo.
Maybe we could get together some time and talk about it.
Here he comes.
I've got a real feeling that this is the fellow.
Because -- I am.
Elaine -- I love you.
What did she say?
Elaine -- that is not what happened.
All right -- but listen to me. What happened was there was this party at my parents. I drove your mother home -- then we went upstairs to see your portrait --
Elaine -- right now I don't feel like talking much. I'm sorry about everything but I think I'll just do this now.
But Elaine --
I don't know.
I don't know. I don't know what's happening.
I don't see how we can.
I'll think about it.
I just don't think it would...
Carl Smith. He's a medical student. We've known him for years.
Hello -- who is this?
Is the doctor anywhere?
Ahhh.
Who screamed?
I am going to call the police now.
For God's sake, Benjamin, will you stop acting that way and bring me the purse?
Mrs. Robinson -- I don't quite know how to put this --
Uh -- The Taft Hotel.
The Singleman party, sir?
It's in the main ballroom.
A room. I'd like a room, please.
Well it's in the car. It's out in the car.
Oh. Well actually, I'd just as soon find it myself. I just have the toothbrush to carry up and I think I can manage it myself.
Is what a girl?
Look -- I drove you home. I was glad to do it. But I have some things on my mind. Can you understand that?
What do you drink?
What?
So?
It's all right.
Yes.
Benjamin?
Will you unzip my dress?
Oh. Well, goodnight.
Right.
Because you're going to bed. I don't think I should be up here.
Benjamin -- I'm not trying to seduce you. I wish you'd --
Where is it?
Jesus Christ!
Yes. Yes. Let me out!
Waiter!
Well -- I don't. I mean I could. Or we could just talk.
Well -- do you want to go up first?
I'll be up in five minutes.
Isn't there something you want to tell me?
Yes.
The number.
Benjamin.
Why don't you watch?
You're welcome.
Mrs. Robinson -- I can't do this.
No -- but look -- maybe we could do something else together, Mrs. Robinson -- would you like to go to a movie.
Well?
Go ahead then.
Neither.
No.
What one.
We've talked enough, Benjamin.
Are you shocked?
Yes.
Art.
I don't think we were the first.
What?
Well look. I have no intention of taking her out.
Yes.
I wouldn't know.
Well it's pretty obvious you don't want me around any more.
Thank you.
Listen to me very carefully, Benjamin. You are not to see Elaine again. Ever. Those are my orders. Is that clear?
I think we have everything quite under control now, Benjamin. Would you like a quick drink before you go?
I'll find her.
I'd like you to know my sister, Miss DeWitte --
Yes, but I'm afraid --
Hello, Mrs. Robinson.
No, I do. I want to tell you.
Not if you don't want to.
Goodnight.
I do.
Oh, Ben -- this is so -- exciting --
No -- they don't.
About an hour ago.
You got me.
You'll never be young again.
Ben, can I say something to you?
Oh no.
I will.
Oh -- not too much. Taking it easy.
I will.
Well, I don't think we have a whole lot to say to each other, Ben. I do think you should know the consequences of what you've done. I do think you should know that my wife and I are getting a divorce soon.
Shaking hands. Well, that's not saying much for my wife, is it?
Yes, I can.
That what he says. Right?
Your bank, Mr. Kringelein.
Every glass high to life -- the splendid, dangerous, mighty, brief -- brief life -- and the courage to live it.  Baron, you know -- I've only lived since last night -- but that little while seems longer than all the time before -- all the -- 
I've told you a hundred times not to speak to me with a cigarette in your mouth.
Not now.
No.
Chloroform on a handkerchief from behind -- while you...
Why?
You can't.
You might find a bullet through that head...
Did you ever see a stenographer with a decent frock on? -- One that she'd bought herself?
Where downstairs?
Chasing what?
Would you like to make a man happy?
Yes --
I'd like to smoke a cigarette.
I did not know you were so beautiful... and --
How tired you are!
You mustn't talk Russian to me.
That is not so -- you don't want to be alone. 
I should like to smoke.
I want to be alone.
When I was a little boy I was taught to ride and be a gentleman -- at school, it was a monastery, I learned to pray and lie -- and ---
Please look at me. You must believe me -- you must believe that I love you -- that I have never known what love is -- until last night. 
Yes.
Suzette will be back here in a minute.
I'll go. -- I love you.  I'll be on that train. I'll get the money.
Not at all, sir. 
Do I know him -- I know him through and through.
Yes, quite.
I'd like to Kringelein, but I can't -- I am broke!
We could come to my room.
You've lost everything?
I do drink, Baron -- I drink to you, Baron and to win.  It's good, -- come along, Baron.
Good evening, Mr. Pimenov.
I thought she was splendid!
Insolent -- Berlin manners.
We shall see who remains here the longer.
I must have made a mistake.
Look here, sir -- I'm completely at your mercy -- I'm desperate -- it's a matter of life or death -- I had to get some money -- tonight.
No -- letters to two-eighty.
No -- no -- not yet. Well, I mustn't let it interfere with my duty. Any news here?
I don't believe it -- he was a real gentleman. I know people... I'm so tired I can hardly see out of my eyes. No sleep for two nights and so many duties and now this killing in the hotel -- that means a lot of work. But it's too bad about the Baron, you always felt better when he came along -- always friendly -- such an agreeable fellow.
Send his bags up to my room.
More than fourteen thousand marks... were in that pocketbook.
You are funny. You speak of life as if it were a train you wanted to catch.
Yes -- it's stimulating -- a man might --
She's beautiful -- isn't she?
Yes.
I'm happy, Miss Flaemm.
Money!
Nonsense! We'll find a great doctor, he'll cure you. They can cure anything these days.
I'm the stenographer.
Moreover --
No -- only occasional jobs. 
You pay me.
I got ten marks for that.
Moreover...
Only in mutual advantages -- moreover.
Should throw a great weight into the balance...
My daughters -- yes, my daughters. 
That'll be all -- be here tomorrow at nine o'clock. 
I'll remember you, Mr. Kringelein.
Sit here.  Cognac -- for you?
Well?
I understand perfectly.
Well, he's a gentleman!
Yes, Mr. Preysing -- that's what we want to know.
They turn out marvelous material in Manchester.
We are here to discuss our merger. Naturally I can make no statement at this time. We must begin at the beginning.
All you have to do is phone for it.
And I said we didn't.
Five minutes, Suzette, come back in five minutes. I'll ring.
The house is not full -- Is it really full?
You haven't time.
The performance -- the performance -- the performance. 
Yes, Pimenov.  One minute, Suzette, I will call you.
Well, now, that's very kind -- thanks. That's what I want -- a large room on the front with a private bath -- Yes, that's what I want. I can pay now if you like.
Do you think you have free license to be insulting? Believe me you have not. You think you're superior, but you're quite an ordinary man.
-- We must do something...
No -- no -- wait -- the man was a burglar -- he was going to steal my money.
The scandal -- we are men -- you -- you could take that affair of the young lady upon yourself -- take her and hold your tongue. Then you can travel -- I'll give you anything -- anything -- she was with you.
No, I won't wait -- I can't -- Every day is precious -- every hour -- Every minute.
You are late. Hurry.
When she gets her paint on and hears the music -- she'll be all right. I know these people.
Have I kept you waiting?
Well -- gentlemen.
Bluff -- Bluff -- all bluff.
Zinnowitz, would you say she was pretty?
Let's go down and find her -- I need a drink -- Come along Zinnowitz.  I don't know anything about women -- been married for twenty-six years.
I'm not getting away with anything, Bobo.
Bobo, no, I --
You'll never shit right again.
Oh, thanks, Bobo.
Gee, I better not, if it's okay. I still gotta drive back up to Los Ang-gleez.
On the square, huh? And how are you making out these days? Stealing much?
Well, you can tell them I said they're right.  I better get going. Roy'll wonder where I am.
I will. So long, Bobo.
Hah.
Fine.
Can't move.
You know who I work for.
My son will be all right. If he isn't, I'll have you killed.
Delmar? I never go out to California. That's a thousand miles from here.
I know.
Why? What's wrong?
But what's wrong?
Hello.
Just myself.
I didn't realize. Yeah, you do look a little pale. How soon will you be ready? A week?
I take care of the being-fair-to-me department. Things've gone to hell this long, they can go a little longer.
I guess I'm just not a leader of men.
The truth is, Mr. Kaggs --
Fair enough.
Just a little accident. I went by your place, picked up your mall. Just bills, I'll take care of them.
You do not! Roy Dillon? Cornball clown pictures? Commission salesman? It's all a front, isn't it? You're on the grift, I know you are. You're working some angle, and don't tell me you're not because I wrote the book!
You don't have the stomach for it.
Not for long. Not when they do a fingerprint check.
This way's perfect.
And making you feel bad at the same time, huh? But that's the way I am, you know, the way I've always been. Always picking on poor little Roy.
What?
Scram. Go home.
Oh, I am, baby, believe me.
I'll pay Lilly back, don't you worry about that.
That's just Lilly's way.
Oh, don't be stupid.
Because it's comfortable.
You ain't seen nothin.
I'm a salesman.
The long end. Big con.
I thought these people were broke.
Yeah? How?
Where?
Upstate where?
I need a partner, Roy. I need an inside man, and you're it. You could be as wonderful as Cole.
Separate bathrooms, darling. I will not lay out all my cosmetics for you to knock over.
You and me, Roy. What a team we'll make. We think alike; we get along together. Once or twice a year we take some slob, the rest of the time we live like this. You won't regret this, Roy.
Yes or no. They're both easier at home. Okay?
What?
It may be Lilly, but it isn't suicide.
I'm sorry, that's an unfortunate phrase, it slipped out, I'm, to tell you the truth, Mr. Dillon, this isn't an everyday occurrence around here.
No question, huh?
Right.  So why don't we get on with this investigation?
That don't match either of the victim's.
Explaining the low height of the blood splatter on the curtains...
Girl scouts.
Care to join me?
Sweet dreams, Blake.
I'd prefer you didn't.  I'm very busy.
I never stop thinking about it, Detective.  The only way in or out of this school is through that gate, and it is secured at all times.
Pretty messy.  Parents have already been notified.  Our office has been trying to get a hold of you...
Well, Eddie Catero didn't show up for work this morning... parents say he never came home last night. Car's still missing.
Would somebody shut this guy up?
And miss the big game?  No way.
My office?
My point exactly.  See, we both agree.
I took the padlock off your door. What more do you want?
To the bathroom.  Can I do that alone or do you want to watch?
I know.
Nothing.
I was trying to get away from someone.
No.
I was trying to protect you from this...
Just get on the bus.
That would work.
Why not?
I came to see you.
Then you come out here.
You saw that Michael Meyers display.  You've got to be pretty twisted to come up with something like that.
Looks great.  It does.
Can't you hold it?
I did alright.
He gave me a fuckin' A?  Wow.
I thought you were allergic to latex.
You think they'll let him in dressed like that?
You mean Tommy.  Yeah, on the weirdness scale he's about an eleven.  Supposedly some scary shit happened to him when he was a kid.  Messed up his head.  He's harmless, though.  Probably just lonely.
Relax.  Everything's cool.  Didn't I tell you Harry would be here?
Isn't he that psycho who's been spying on my sister?
Guess so ...
Danny!!!
Relax, John.  They were just kids.
You'll never pass that exam on an empty stomach, Kara.
To find the rest of your family before Michael Myers does -- or whoever's been controlling him.
He's gone.
But surely Rogers isn't --
Please try to understand, Terence. I've already made up my mind.
After six years?  Sam, she died with him in that explosion after the --
An old friend.
I'll meet you over there.
Jamie's baby ...
I know he's alive.  People in this town -- they want us to believe he's dead.  But I know. I've always known.
One thing, anyway--at least Penelope didn't throw out all your crap.  I bet Alice threw out all my crap after I'd been gone a week.
How all the magazines show tits today.
Go home!  Show them how rich you are for a change!
You're right!  We'll take a trip. A trip is what we'll take.  I don't want to talk about motorcycles.  I don't want to talk about tits.  Go home!
Let's talk about something else.
The educational process.
Wear your uniform and every decoration, and let them despise you, if they dare.
I dunno. You know.  I used to really love that Alice. Do you know that?
What's this?
You did?
The one direct, decisive, intelligent act of your life!
How are you, honeybunch?
The posies are for her?
It sapped our will--made us peaceful and unenterprising.  It was a form of chemical castration. We became two more sleepy Indians.
What you say is, "Pass the fucking catsup."
What?
To make an ass of yourself.
We're ahead of schedule, that's all. You're finding out here what you would have found out in Africa-- that you are a rabbit, born to be eaten alive.
You're hollow, like a woman.
He can shoot!  He can hold his ground!  He can attack!  You're in your proper profession right now-- sucking up dirt for frumpish housewives, closet drunkards every one.
She went to the fight with Herb Shuttle, I guess.
He was a stretcher-bearer in the Korean War.  Were you in a war with Father?
Dad was never in England?
"The sting."
Go on.
Dr. Woodly says he's seen hundreds of children permanently injured by football.  He says that when there's a war, everybody goes but football players.
She's a real heavy sleeper sometimes.
That's nice.  You thank her for me. Go to bed and get lots of sleep, and then you thank her in the morning.
Couldn't you have vanished quietly out the back door?
Heaven.
How do you do, Mrs. Ryan?  I'd heard you were beautiful, and so you are.  Am I intruding here?
Every fuse in my nervous system has been blown.
You'd better get Dr. Woodly.
Shouldn't you lie down?
Have some.
Say hello to your mother.
A trip, you mean?
Ram it up your ass!
Scrambled eggs, kippered herring, fried potatoes--and a whole onion. I want to eat the onion like an apple.  Do you understand?
This is not a coy deception.  I do not want to be scrogged.  I want love.  I want tenderness.
What are you going to do?
He feels awful loss--which was precisely my intention.
Almost a Christmas scene.
Just one favor.
I want you to tell me that you loved me once.
I see.
If he thinks he's man enough.
I plan to live one hundred years!
Don't!
You've killed women?
Of course he can go--if he'll just go down on his hands and knees for a moment--and promise me that he does not find me comical in the least degree.
Gentlemen--that's nice.
I came back.
Whose son this is, whose wife that is.  A fianc is the most ridiculous appurtenance this household could have at this time.  Good night.
I've never heard of it.
I can just hear the editorial wee- wee-weeing when Looseleaf and I start flying in pacqualinincheewa root.  I can hear the Alice-sit-by- the-fires now: "We discovered it in the Amazon Rain Forest.  Now we cure you with it.  Now we lower our eyes with becoming modesty as we receive heartfelt thanks."
This little corpse is intended as a lesson?
The same hairy, humorless old gods who move you from hither to yon. "Honor, " if you like.
We do survive, don't we?  You're going to have to apologize, of course, for calling me a bastard. That's a matter of form--not allowing you or anybody to call me a bastard.  No rush about that. Just remember to apologize sometime soon.
Comical?
You're a clown.  You're a clown who kills--but you're a clown.
In any event, I will not beg for mercy.
I've struck my blow.
Poison.
I--I really must congratulate you. Something is happening in there.
My violin is avenged!
No!
I've enjoyed being man.
Get up.
Have it your way.  We'd both be better off dead now.
Colonel Harper, retired now, dropped an atom bomb on Nagasaki during the Second World War, killing seventy-four thousand people in a flash.
There was so much going on.
Jesus.
Yeah--cripes.  I never did get any sense out of Alice.  She found me holding up the old lady, dead as a mackerel.  It was a bitch.  You know--maybe Mrs. Wheeler was going to die then and there anyway, even if I'd been the paper boy.  Maybe not.  I dunno, boy.  That's civilian life for you.  Who knows what kills anybody?
I dunno.
What will you do, Colonel?
I don't want to live any more.
You're the only woman he ever took out.
Father's friend.
There stands the loins from which you've sprung.
It is you, isn't it, Harold?
Shivers and sweats and groans.  His teeth chatter.  What'll we do?
You're taking Mom out tonight?
Oh?
A monument to a man who thought that what the world needed most was more rhinoceros meat.
It's jungle rot!  This room is making everybody sick!  This is your family doctor speaking now.  Here--I brought you something else to hang on your wall, for the sake of variety.
Keeps fairies away!
Maybe it's supposed to end now. Maybe God wouldn't have it any other way.
Or was.  We haven't done anything wrong, you know.
That's when I'll get my confidence back.
Yeah.
It's dark in there. PENELOPE And that's where he is!
A what?
I feel as though I had been made a perfect chump of.
Well--it was nice while it lasted. Thanks for the memories.
No doubt Paul thinks it stinks.
What?
The only thing I ever told him about life was, "Keep out of the park after the sun goes down."
Why would you do that?
Paul's only twelve years old.
We've got to rescue him.
Tell her to have a nice trip.
Oh--look at the poor, crucified violin, would you?
You fake!  You're no better than the dumbest general in the Pentagon.  You're not going to beat Harold. You're not going to beat anybody. You're not going to stay here, either--yammering and taunting until you're most gloriously killed. Go home!
Not true.
That's not true either--or needn't be, unless we make it true.
Which we do.  But we can stop doing that.
Penelope!  We're late!
You can believe that if you want. I talk to guys like you, and I want to commit suicide.  You get that weight-lifting set I sent you?
Maybe God has let everybody who ever lived be reborn--so he or she can see how it ends.  Even Pithecanthropus erectus and Australopithecus and Sinanthropus pekensis and the Neanderthalers are back on Earth--to see how it ends. They're all on Times Square--making change for peepshows.  Or recruiting Marines.
He died of a massive rupture.
Then we'd stay home and eat venison or something, and look through the scrapbooks.  I've got a friend who has a whole freezer full of striped bass and caribou meat.  I'm going to bring that boy back.
Yes, we do.
What do you mean, not the type? Don't you know who I am? I'm Big Dick Brown! I've been in more porno movies than you ever saw. I've worked with Harry Reems. I've worked with Johnny Wad. Not the type! I can come ten times a day. I can keep it hard two hours at a time. My cock is nine inches long.
Do you have any particular choice of girl?
Well, I want to...
Pull out your cock.
What do you want to tip me for? Look, you got to spell it out. Whatever you want, just say it.
...about this woman.  I'm trying to find her. Do you know her?
Yeah.
That's all you got, three girls?
I was told there was a real nice girl here named Joanne. Quite young.
I tried to get more, but this is the limit. The De Vries line has the same area.
Overpowering?
Yes. I think it'll look better.
Yeah. How did you know?
Yeah.
Um-hm. Live sound.
You know her?
Ulcers.
You don't understand shit.
No. But does it make any difference?  How did you get to be the way you are?
Not very.
Tod was.  He was with Ratan.
He deals in pain.
It's an anagram. It comes from the Canons of Dort. Every letter stands for a different belief. T-U-L-I-P. Like -- are you sure you're interested in this?
Wait, wait. I'm trying to figure this out. This is like Rona Barrett. Before you become saved, God already knows who you are?
So it's already worked out. The fix is in?
I thought I was fucked up.
What makes you so sure?
So I guess we're both fucked, huh? But at least you get to go to heaven. I don't get shit.
So then, Mr. Mast...
What are you paying me for?
Where is she?
They are?
Get out.
Get out!
I felt like such a shit, pilgrim, after what I did to you -- not that I did anything wrong -- that I kept investigating, poking around. There's some poor s.o.b. in L.A. with his face all bent out of shape who you've damaged his movie career. Lucky for him, people don't look at his face.
Go home, pilgrim. There's nothing you can do. Forget this place. Start over.
Yeah. She's quite upset. I'm going to fly out today. They want me to bring some pictures.
What?
We're casting for an explicit sex action feature...
That's not true, Mr...?
I thought you were quite good in it. I also like the girl in it. Really thought she was good.  I wondered if she was still around. If she was still working.
No.
I want to meet Ratan.
Is this with a girl named Kristen?
Good.
You ain't goin' nowhere alone.
Let's go.
I don't know what you're talking about.
That girl? No, never saw her. I don't know anybody.
That's all right.
Film making can be pretty expensive...
...I'd just start my own business. That's what I did. Get into kid porn. That's big now. Why don't you come around the set? Meet some people. If you still want to invest, I'll ask around.
Nope never saw her before.  Kurt, come over here. Don't use underage kids. Wouldn't touch 'em for all the cow shit in Mexico.  You recognize this piece of wool, Kurt?
Political Science. It's all about what's going on.
Oh, I don't have one.
I just don't think we have one, unless it's in the glove compartment. Could you look, Harold?
Well, it's not really mine. I dug it up in front of the courthouse. We're transplanting it. Letting it breathe, you know. But, of course, we would like to get it into soil, as soon as possible.
Is this your shovel?
Where are the papers?
Not very.
A rather free translation but nonetheless correct. Greetings to you too, my little one.  Tell me, what do you see?
What?... Oh yes... Shovel... Create ... Verily these issues lie in the lap of the gods... Iliad... Just sit down for a minute.
Oh, so do I. They're such fun, aren't they? It's all change. All revolving. Burials and births. The end to the beginning and the beginning to the end -  - the great circle of life. My, this old thing handles well. Ever drive a hearse, Harold?
Thank you. But when you take these cars don't you think you are wronging the owners?
It's very interesting.
Yes. Very much.
Subways... Perfume... Cigarette...  ... Cologne... Carpet... Chestnuts! ... <u>Snow!</u>
Certainly a new experience for me.
Well...
That little tree. It's in trouble. Come on.
It is kind of rough.
Look, the ice is melting.
Well, I really don't drink...
Some nuts? Some licorice? It has no nutritional value but then consistency is not really a human trait.
Oh, Big Issues. Liberty. Rights. Justice. Kings died and kingdoms fell. I don't regret the kingdoms - what sense in borders and nations and patriotism - but I do miss the kings. When I was a little girl I was taken to the palace in Vienna, to a garden party. I can still see the sunshine, the parasols, and the flashing uniforms of the young officers. I thought then I would marry a soldier.  Later, Frederick would chide me about it.  He was so serious. A doctor at the University. And in the government.
Well, I don't...
I don't know.
Yeah. And it is cold in here. Hello, Glaucus.
Yes. It's almost there.
It's all right.  It's organic.
Vice? Virtue? It's best not to be too moral. You cheat yourself out of too much life. Aim above morality. As Confucius says, "Don't simply be good. Make good things happen."
Well --  - they say he was very wise, so I'm sure he must have.
How ingenious! Tell me about them.
Harold, everyone has the right to make an ass out of themselves. You just can't let the world judge you too much.
Where's that?
What is it, Harold?
Well, they're my species.
Oh, you've thought of everything. And champagne.
Why yes. It's my eightieth birthday.
Maude, please. Don't die. I couldn't bear it. Please, don't die.
But why now?
Please! She has got to see a doctor right away.
Well, not <u>dying</u>, actually. I'm changing. You know, like from winter to spring. Of course, it is a big step to take.
I have a sore throat.
Harold, please! I'm on the phone.
Can't complain.
Does that worry you?
Why?
Oh. Well, how do you spend your day?
No. It's the junk. I like to look at junk.
Yes.
Yes.
No.  I'd have liked to.
During wartime the national suicide rate goes down.
Well, I don't...
Souvenirs?
Yes, ma'am. Somebody had some trouble parking.
I knew you'd come.
She certainly has.
Sorry, friend. No day trips to Hell. Here you are. Here you stay. And forward the only way to go.
God, that's terrible.
So you slept O.K.?
The boxes! I TOLD you.
Are you crazy?
WHY?
Go on. But trick us again, child, and your suffering will be legendary even in Hell.
No, No, this one didn't escape. You told me you'd always been in Hell. You were wrong. Look at it. LOOK. IT'S YOU.
I saw it... him. But I got away. And I took the box. And I solved it. And they came.
Story of my life.
Nothing psychic about it. You're easy.
Behind this door. A dark entity -- Evil, ancient and hungry.
Red -- you need to hear the rest of the information --
Amongst other things, yes -- but that's hardly the point.
Ruins. Not rocks. The remains of Trondham Abbey. Built on an intersection of Ley Lines, the boundaries between our world and the other --
There is a place -- a dark place where evil slumbers and awaits to return. From there it infects our dreams. Our thoughts. Grigory gave us a glance tonight --
No. It was red. Bright red.
I thought you liked being on TV.
I know where to find him. I'll get him back.
Don't worry. I'll get him soon enough --
Is it bad?
Icthyo Sapiens, April 14, 1865.
I wanted to see her.  It's nobody's business.
This -- ? This is nothing. You know what'll kill me?  Her.
His horns. He files 'em. To "fit in."
No. Don't --
You call that thing a cigar??
You never, ever light a cigar that way.
Yes?
Not hungry.
Oh, okay then. Maybe later then.
60% OF THE WOMEN IN THIS WORLD ARE NAMED "LIZ".
Who are you calling a fucking ass- hole? It's this bastard bed that's your fucking problem!
Hi.
Her mother's dead.
Julia's my second wife.
Who are you?
You solved the box. We came. Now you must come with us. Taste our pleasures.
To a man called Frank Cotton?
You can keep them.
I have to speak to my father.
First things first. You can have a telephone when we've talked. Do you know who did this to you?
Don't mourn him. He was dead long before we laid a finger on him.
Poor baby.
That's right. This is Frank you're talking to, remember? FRANK.
Forget him.
Oh my God.
Just help, will you? Please God, help me --
Good.
You're hurting.
You promised me an explanation.
And you came back here to solve the puzzle --
So you were cheated.
Yes. They'll never find us.
I don't.
Which is where?
We're going to freeze to death.
He won't complain. He can pay off some of his creditors.
I cut myself.
Shit.
O.K.
Don't go upstairs.
Please. I can't bear it...
Just soda.
That depends.
I... suppose so, yes.
Yeah, why don't I?
Maybe I will.
What's wrong?
What happened to me?
My father doesn't answer. I have to go find him.
Daddy?
I found a room.
YOU'D like my room.
Well come over, will you? See the place?
What for, honey? You know we can look after you. You've made the gesture --
O.K.
You like?
Is Julia here?
Really?
What?
Gone?
Yes!
I thought we'd lost you.
Please. I want to see you home. All right?
If there's a train.
Are you alright ?
Just go. PLEASE. I'll be O.K. I'm going to go see Dad. He'll look after me --
Will you GO, damn you?
I don't know.
I beg your pardon?
Great.  That's the fun of working in a record store.  Playing crappy pap you don't want to listen to.  I thought this tape was going to be, you know, a conversation stimulator. I was going to ask you for your top five records to play on a Monday morning and all that, and you just had to ruin it.
We didn't even really have it.  I happen to know for a fact that the only Stevie Wonder single we have is "Don't Drive Drunk." I was just goofing on the straight, and it never cost you a penny.
Bullshit.  The guy was going to buy one record -- which we didn't even have -- and leave and never come back again anyway.  Why not have a little fun?  Big fucking deal.
Oh, now you're defending that motherfucker?  You're going soft in your old age, Rob.  There was a time when you would have chased him out of the store and up the street.  Now all of a sudden I'm offending your golf buddy.  You're right, Rob.  I am so sorry. How are we ever going to make enough money to get you and Laura into the country club?
Ehh.
Oh no, Rob, that's not obvious enough. Not at all.  Dick, did you hear that?
Yeah, you would say that, wouldn't you?  You two have to stick together now.  Boners United.  United in getting some.
Suck my ass.
That's why you got the gig, isn't it?
How many tickets can I put you down for?
So much for friends, then.  You're a bitter bastard, Rob, you know that?
No, no, no, you said "The Number Four With a Smile," and there's no "The" at the front of the title of the album.
On Clark Street!
Anna who?  Anna Green Gables?  Anna Conda?
No.  No.  Mom wants you to come to the funeral.  It's on Friday.
I'm Caroline Fortis from The Reader. I want to do a story on you.
That's five.  So.  Why did you decide to deejay again?
Yeah, sure...
Yeah.
Yeah but more than that.  I'm happy because I'm proud of us.  Because although our talents are small and peculiar, we use them to their best advantage.
Hello, Rob.  Remember me?  I'm Ray. Ian.
Good.  So shall we leave it at that then?
We won't leave it, Ian.  Not ever.
I should be so lucky.
Yes.  Well, I'm coming over to your house to get some things.
So, what, you haven't definitely decide to dump me?  There's still a chance we'll get back together?
So we have a chance of getting back together again.
Fine.  One.
No.  I was living with you, remember? We've slept together but we haven't made love.  Not yet.  But I'll tell you one thing.  The sleeping together is better.
No, not -- I mean have you, you know --
I think the big question here is where are you, if you don't mind my saying so, and I think I know where you are.  You're running.  On the run.  You're running from a point that everyone hits in any relationship, and you're just going to hit it again with Ian but it's going to be with a World Music bunny- rabbit-looking earth-shoe-wearing "Doctor Who"-watching twit who doesn't really understand you, not the way that I do and will more in the future, and you'll have just wasted more time and arrive in the exact same place that you're in now, only later. And with... him.
You don't ever think about other people?
That bad, eh?
Those aren't mine.
I'm sorry to go on about it.  But, I don't know, there's a lesson here somewhere, and I want to make sure you get it.
Well, think about it.
I can't talk right now.
Pigsty.
My dad liked you.  And Mom never told him we'd split, because he wasn't up to it and... oh, I don't know.  I don't really understand it.  I think she thinks he'll be able to see what's going on.  It's like...  He's been through so much, what with dying and everything, that she doesn't want to upset him any more than she has to.
Thank you.  I appreciate it.  I can't reciprocate.
I don't know.  Sometime.  Later. Listen, Rob, would you have sex with me?
I want to feel something else than this.  It's either that or I go home and put my hand in the fire.  Unless you want to stub cigarettes out on my arm.
Ray's a disaster.  I don't know what that was all about, except that sometimes you need someone to lob into the middle of a bad relationship like a hand grenade, I guess, and blow it all apart.
It was like sex.  What else could it be like?
What's the difference?
Look, we're okay now.  We just had a nice time.  Let's leave it at that.
But why doesn't it matter that we're not the same people we used to be?
You're being stupid.
That's not the point.  I mean, what if the single isn't done in time?
That's okay.  You seem pissed off all the time, though.
Would you marry me if I was?
Right.  Okay, then.  Shall we go?
This stuff.  Love and marriage.  I want to think about something else.
It's true!
Well she --
Enough of what?
If by "we" you are referring to men, then I have to say that just the once would do.
Yup.
Yeah, I know the Crumblers!  I bought a used Blasters album in New York about ten years ago and somebody left a Crumblers single in it.  My everything changed for a couple of weeks.
Exactly!  Fucking ex-actly!
And so it is.  I'll talk to you later.
Right.
Hi, Rob.  It's your mother.
Everything all right?
I must have nothing.  Their my husband's.
Years.  This collection is as close as he's ever come to an achievement.
Okay.  Because you took the trouble to come up here.  And because you've got principles.  But that's it.  I'm not selling them to you one by one.
Naw.  Those are for us.
Well we don't.
Wait a minute.  Island Records charged U2 a million five against their overhead for one plane ride.
Maybe he's hiding from something.
Sure.
Didn't think it was my buddy over there.
Claymore.
Scottish claymore.  Take a French epee, add twenty pounds of ballast so it means business, and you've got a claymore.
I don't follow you.
There was this one fella.  Asked a lot of questions.  I was out of town but I heard he spent near a full day in the records office.
-All but one out of a hundred, I know.  All left to be led like donkeys back home.  Now if you will please-
You needn't worry Miss Cartwright. I've been at this a very long time.
That bothers you?
Go home.
You're a fool.
Not all of them.
The less exposure I recieve around government buildings the better.  You, as Mrs. Taupin, will attract considerably less attention than I.
Yes.
It's beautiful.
Yes.
Yes.
No.  Just the child of some lonely girl I gave a ride to.  When they died I put them in a grave with my name on it. Twenty years later I became the son.
A factor of age.
You won't.
That would be difficult to explain.
Of bodies.
It's bullshit.  Everything. My job, the people I get involved with, I'm up to here with it.
You see that desk?  _Your_ desk?  You see the crap piled up on it?
I am from Spain.  And I would like a moment of your time.
I should imagine that your recovery must have alarmed your fellow villagers, perhaps giving them reason to invent an explanation.  And a solution.
First food, no?  A good meal makes conversation so much easier.
This is madness!
Hide.  Run to the ends of the Earth till you learn.  You must learn to defend yourself.  In this I can help.
Go to hell.
And what is this great gift that cannot be seen or smelt?
If that was meant to be an ex- planation Mr. Romirez from Spain, I'm afraid you've failed.
Of course.
That's mad.  Surely you don't take their word?
I'll not take that kind of talk from you.  From those others below, maybe.  But not from you.
Perhaps not.  You seem to have misplaced a private.  No doubt by now his head is stranger to his neck.
So sure?
Not likely.
Mulet.
Staff sargeant detailed me to prepare firewood for the break- fast cooking.
Second musketeer.
Stay out of it.
Won't know till the records department comes back with it this after- noon.  Looks good though. They found the receipt in his townhouse.  It was pretty smeared but had Taupin's father listed as a signatory.
Head still secure to the neck.
How many places this side of the Atlantic serve lager and lime?
How do you do it, Kahn?  How do you live so full of life for so long?
You're wrong.
Not so long.
My quarry grows clever with age.  And the others, incompetent.
Of sorts.
Leave her out of this.
I have waited forever for this. You will not cheapen it, little boy.
Are you here?
That's none of your business.
Your murder weapon?
Where were you Tuesday night?
Do you?
But I had heard his wounds were mortal.
We were very close.
When may I expect the cleaners?
No.
Why don't you fellows get your own news?
The Sheriff has just received four more letters threatening his life, but he says nothing can interfere with his duty.
What's the idea of locking this?
The poem?... The poem was great!
Seventy-five.
Wait a minute, Bruce. What's commission on a $100,000.00 policy?
Wait a minute, Bruce. Have you got that money?
Yes, he is... Look, Bruce, we're taking that next train -- and when I say next train, this time I mean it!
But, gee, Hildy -- he gave us that insurance business -- and you promised --
No, I was going to give it to her -- but she left hurriedly.
Oh, yes. Here it is.
I don't think she'll need you very much -- I aim to do most of the protecting myself.
Yes, I know...  Hildy, will you ever forget the night you brought the Governor back to your hotel room and found me taking a bath? She didn't even know I was in town...
No, Bruce, you didn't come between us. It was all over for her before you came on the scene. For me -- it'll never be over.
Certified! I'm afraid Hildy'd feel ashamed to think she hadn't trusted you.
And now I don't know where my mother is. She may be lost.
She's -- well, she's very motherly. That's about the best description I know.
You can't bluff me, Burns. I don't care who you are or what paper you're editor of.
You'll see nothing of the kind, Sheriff.
You will, eh? Well, we'll see about that.  All right, boys. Take it.
The power of the press, huh!
You know what. How long since we've seen each other?
Maybe it was yesterday. Been seeing me in your dreams?
You know, Hildy, I sort of wish you hadn't done it.
Divorced me. It sort of makes a fellow lose faith in himself. It almost gives him a feeling he wasn't wanted.
Well, I meant to let you go -- but, you know, you never miss the water till the well runs dry.
Well, I don't want to brag, but I've still got the dimple -- and in the same place -- I just acted like any husband who doesn't want to see his home broken up.
All I know is that instead of two weeks in Atlantic City with my bridegroom, I spent two weeks in a coal mine with John Kruptzky -- age sixty-three -- getting food and air out of a tube! You don't deny that. Do you?
I know, Walter, but I --
Well, the paper'll have to learn to do without me. And so will you. It just didn't work out, Walter.
Keep away --
Listen, you bumble-headed baboon --
Please! Will you just --
Who says I can't? You're a newspaper man.
What's his line?
I wish you everything I couldn't give you, Hildy.
Now you got me.
Thanks.
How do you like that? Here I am being nice to you and your sweet-heart and that's the thanks I get!
I'm an editor. I know what ought to be written, but I can't write it the way you could. It needs a woman's heart --
Well, it's either an act on your part or a miracle on Sweeney's.
It cost me four hundred and fifty bucks to tear it out of Cooley.
Never mind it? That's not my money! That's Bruce's money!
Yes. Where is he?
You can't take that desk out. It's crawling with cops outside.
Huh!
Give him the works.  Hello, Duffy, get set! We've got the biggest story in the world. Earl Williams caught by the Morning Post -- exclusive!
Where's Butch?
You said it! But this'll teach him a lesson. He won't quit his paper without giving notice after this.
Was she? Did you notice?
Mission Hospital? Gimme the Receiving Room.
Who did you talk to?
Uh-uh. As long as we were in there together pitching -- they couldn't lick us. Well, it's been a lot of fun.
Remember the time we broke into the D.A.'s office, and copied Fifi Randell's diary?
Yeah. I suppose I could. But, Walter --
I don't know what to do, Walter.
Don't touch me! I'm not doing it for you!
No, he won't. I wired him that I wasn't coming.
Well, maybe I'd like to know just once!
Walter, you can't do that!
What's that -- what's that?
I was in here -- and they had some kind of murderer in with them. They were hiding him!
You grey-haired old Judas!
What do you mean, I handed her? The patrol wagon was on the wrong side of the street.
I don't think she's talking much... You know what I mean?
Hildy -- I can't. I'm busy -- I -- Let me up, Hildy. Earl Williams has escaped --
It doesn't matter. The publicity's the main thing.
Aw, why don't you let her alone? She's ill!
What's the dope, Sheriff?
I wasn't born yesterday. Now the boys tell me you and this Mollie Malloy --
What do I know about Williams?
Don't take any chances. Shoot through the desk.
This tear bomb went off unexpectedly in the hands of Sheriff Hartman's Bombing Squad.
The names are Merwyn D. Mayor, who is the Mayor's brother-in-law --
Howard Shenken, the Sheriff's uncle on his mother's side --
Yeah. But I --
No, I couldn't do that.
I ain't got time, Fred, honest. I'll see you after.
Fred!
Fred, I don't know what to say. A thing like this almost destroys a man's faith in human nature.
Well, there's a lot of Communistic sympathizers around --
But we're going to hang him, Fred. He can't get away.
We got to think fast before those lying reporters get hold of this. What'll we tell 'em?
Ah, Fred --  Hello... this is Hartman --
They got him!  Wait a minute -- hold the wire.  They got Earl Williams surrounded -- the Riot Squad has -- in his house.
I did.  Hold the wire.
What?
What did you do with her?
Oh, some insurance man. Are you in?
But, Bruce, don't keep it in your wallet!... Well, you see --  -- there's an old newspaper superstition that the first big check you get you -- you put in the lining of your hat. That brings you good luck for ten years.
I thought so, too.
All right, all right. You can't blame a guy for tryin', can you?
I didn't frisk him. He must have dropped it in Burns' office. I didn't know whose it was.
What -- already? Why, the dame left only a minute before I did!
Well -- I was going, but Mollie fainted away and I thought I ought to do what I could.
Yes, that makes a lot of sense, Earl.
Put down that gun, Earl.
Don't move!
What's that? Only -- you're getting too near. I don't trust anybody.
They're not human!
Wait a minute, Mollie.
I'm a messenger at the State House. This is from the Governor.
Forty dollars.
Who do you think!
No, it doesn't.  Now, remember: you never delivered this.  You got caught in the traffic, or something.  Now, get out of here and don't let anybody see you.
A very fine-looking women.
I think you hit him, Grandpa. He was limping when he ran off.
No, you're out, Grandpa. It's my turn.
Yes, you was. Make him talk.
What's that?
I only know one.
Bugger off.
Bugger off, you bloody sod.
It doesn't matter, I can drive the car home.
Would.
Ask her yourself.
It's easy. I've done it.
...and four and five...
It's like telling fibs.
We will, you will, for the rest of our lives?
Weeds will grow, Mac.
Kiss me Hardy.
Rosehill Avenue. No roses. No hill. And it's certainly not an avenue.
You need trees for an avenue.
There is all right. This Hitter fellow. We've got to winkle him out. And get shot of some of our lot at the same time.
And it was the last. Hasn't written a letter since. Not even a birthday card.
That's it.
I've had a letter from her. They've moved house.
This phoney war get's on my nerves. If we're going to have a war, I wish they'd get it started.
Out.
There, there, my baby.
He's being posted. I was terrible to him.
He said I was right. I shouldn't wait for him. I was better to make a clean break.
It's not. It's happening to me.
Could we salt them, or smoke them, do you think?
My aunt in Australia has offered..
Kids don't care. You're thinking of yourself.
I know you mean well.
Deadwood, is that what it's called? Cool, will you show us?
What?
Go tell him to get your Grandpa.
Yeah, I like the screaming too... it's so much more exciting.
Where's that?
Go straight up about another mile... til we hit Cherrypicker Road and turn right... it ain't far from there.
If you keep going straight you can get back on the interstate... it's easier.
OK.
Oh... yeah, he already left. We'll wait inside, come on.
You sure do a lot of guessing.
The animals have got nothing to do with it.
Nice.
Are you two gals all funny with each other?
Yeah, well we like to get fucked up and do fucked up shit, you know what I mean?
I'll bet you do... how much we owe ya...  ...Goober?
Well fuck me Side Sally, who want to read about all that horse shit anyway.
Oh yeah, I forgot about her. She was pretty hot.
Dude, talk about baggage, that ain't no carry-on shit, that's some heavy duty Samsonite shit.
Then the devil says, "are you gay?" Guy says, "fuck no"... Devil says, "Well then, I guess you're gonna hate Thursdays."
How awesome?
Well, technically I did what ya said.
Thanks.
Turn that fucking radio off!
That food...  ugh, I feel like I'm gonna puke.
Where ya headed?
Whatever it is just do it. The more we play along the faster we'll get the hell out of here.
Quiet.
Hmmmmmmmmm?
And I gave 'em directions out there, up by the old farm row... I figured what's the harm. Stupid kids probably going out to piss up a rope and got themselves turned around backasswards and got lost as shit.
Hmmmmm.
Naw, he don't do anything else with 'em, but he did get caught once with a Planet of the Apes doll hanging out his asshole.
Had to take him to the hospital. Kid had Dr. Zaius stuck half way up his butt, couldn't get it out.
Nova, yeah she looked pretty sweet.
I hear ya.
That's nice.
He should be back in a couple hours.
Oh yeah, murder museum... sounds fun.
I don't know, I just thought it was interesting.
I know, but we can make it out of here. We can do it.
Yeah, well he's still here. I think him and Jerry are fast becoming buddies, you know Jerry... yeah, he's gotta see everything... yeah, I know... thinks there's some unsolved mystery around every corner.
Christ, I hope this isn't more crappy folk art. It's so quaint... it's so primal... it's so crap.
Yeah, I hit burn out mode back at that old stripper lady's place. Watching her dance around with those ratty-looking animals was ridiculous.
I can't believe...
Turn on the headlights. See if anything is out there.
Bill, why don't you ask her... she's your special friend.
Yeah, no mercy here.
You find something, Georgie?
Keys.
Please, let us go, we won't tell anybody.
Huh?
I know the words... fucking psycho fucking bullshit, that's the words.
Negative. Shit, we are so deep in the sticks we could walk for hours and find zero.
I appreciate your cooperation. I'm looking for a missing girl...  ...this girl here, Denise Willis... have you seen her?
Oh, alright... I guess I can trust you... being a man of the law and all.
What! God damn, how many?
Shhhh... you hear that?
Call Wydell.
Dr. Satan?
How old do you think I am? I know who the fuck Spider-man is. Get to your point.
I always favored the Hulk.
Anyway, there's not much else out that way... so, I figure maybe there's a chance the kids broke down and found their way over to one of the farms.
Right...  ...come on.
Excuse me for a second.
Great.  God, I've wanted you forever.
Woof.
French?
Of course not.
I'm in my p.j.'s, too. Funny, huh?
That would be good.
Maybe we should just sit for a while. It's very peaceful.
I'm fine. Life is funny, that's all.
Really? No. Not at all. You're a very pretty girl. You should know that. You should be confident.
It's true. I wouldn't lie.
Nothing, my darling. All is right with the world.
Shit.  Hi, honey.
Hmmmph.
You have to choose Nathan. It's like Sophie's choice. Only it is Nathan's choice. Did you ever see that movie, Sophie's Choice? It is like that. Only it is this.
No! It is now that you must decide.  I love you, Doctor Nathan...  ...but I will not wait. I will not be your chippy. I will not be your little Mademoiselle Parlez-vous side dish.  My love. I want to have a sweet tiny baby inside my belly... from you.
But?... But? There is a "but," Nathan.
I just want to talk.
Terrific. We're all going to be rich and famous.
I don't know.
Oui.
Please let me go with you.
I want to be the way I was before.
Forget him, Lila. We'll disappear. We'll never talk about it again. We'll never talk again period. I love you.
Always. Ow.
Tell me. I could use someone up my alley.
Shut up and tell me.
God, he must be really close to your brother to tell him such personal stuff.
I cannot believe how in love I am with this man.
One night stand?
Oh, Rosie.
Oh, Rosie.
No you won't. But it's okay. You have stuff you gotta do.
I hope you don't perform any of those dreadful torture experiments, Nathan.
Tell her, Harold...  It's just that... It's nothing. It's just that the outside fork is the salad fork. One goes from the outside in as the dinner progresses.
I'm sorry that I became so upset.
I like you, too, Nathan.
Yeah  But I have some peculiarities also.
Why certainly!
I don't think so.  Why?
Of course.
Yes.
That's very funny.
It might behoove us to turn back at this point.
I think he's feral.
He looks perfectly fine.
I don't understand you. This is fascinating and you just want to run away. I mean, here we have a human being totally uncontaminated by civilization, totally free, and all you want to do is run back to your...
Look at him. He doesn't understand English. He moves like an animal.
Nathan, what the hell are you talking about?
I won't allow you. It's wrong. He's happy here.
Nothing. Be right out.
Uh-huh. Right, Gabrielle. Right.
I have to think! I have to think!
That's great.
...the back door of a movie theater. Yes, indeed.
Really?
Such as what womanly things?
I had sold my fucking soul.
Oh boy!
Should I come with?
Seemed fine. Quiet evening enjoying his new digs.
Ugnh.
Ooka.
Now, Puff, we're leaving on the electronic collar. I don't think we'll need to shock you, but just in case.
It's wonderful! Do you think I'm ready? Do you really?
here, here.
Oh please, is that as articulate as you can be after all the time I spent teaching you? We've discussed Wittgenstein, for Christ's sake. Not that you ever had anything very original or challenging to say on the subject.
Unka unka unka unka unka.
Do you suppose it has anything to do with Lila's unusually hairy body?
I just think it might be important to explore your feelings for Lila.
And how do you feel about Gabrielle?
I'm in the book, if you ever want to drop me a line or something.
I know. Been there myself. We've all been there, haven't we, Miss Packard?
You know what's good for him?
You didn't answer my first question. For whom?
Listen, Miss Ladybird, you're here on a rain check and I know it. You're hanging on by your nails. You let that glory whistle blow loud and clear for Eddie and you're a wreck on a railroad track. You're a horse that finished last. So don't make trouble, Miss Ladybird. Live and let live. While you can.
That's the way it's done.
The night is two thousand dollars old.
The name's Gordon. Bert Gordon.
Sit down.
Yeah? Why?
I got drunk.
Maybe he knows how to drink.
In that case, you owe me another drink.
What's that supposed to mean?
Thanks for the drink.
Oh yeah, I figured that. How much?
For who?
You saw me beat Minnesota Fats for eighteen thousand dollars.
Maybe you oughta give me lessons.
You name the place, boss. I'll be there.
How good is he?
I don't. But I got confidence in Findley.
Come on, let's go...
It's all right. She had a little too much to drink, that's all. Forget it.  Go upstairs and sleep it off.
'Bout even.
All right. Five hundred.
And just how do you figure that, Bert? What do you figure I owe you?
No, it don't have to be fifty. It can be thirty... twenty-five.
If it didn't happen in Louisville, it'd happened someplace else. If it didn't happen now, it'd happen six months from now. That's the kinda dame she was.
No. Hell, no! You Eddie Felson?
What kind of straight pool game you like?
Want some free advice?
Yep. Fastest and the bestest... Hey, give us another round, will ya? One for him, one for yourself.
I'll be alive when I get out, Charlie.
You wanted ten thousand? You got ten thousand.
Get with what?
Go on home. Just leave me the money.
If that's all you got, that's all we got left.
Hello, Eddie's girl...  I looked all over for you.
A son.
Talk to me, Charlie.
My twenty-five per cent. Approximately fifteen hundred bucks.
What for? To play Fats again?
Is that what you think?
Yeah. Just like that.
I'm having some people over for drinks right after the races. Why don't you all come over? Then about nine, ten o'clock we can play.
I don't play pool, Mr. Felson. I play billiards. My house, my game. You don't have to play if you don't want to.
Oh no, nothing for me.
Okay?
Ah, that's unfortunate, Mr. Felson.
Yeah. Sure.
Now, look, fella, I saw you playing at Ames the other night.
Oh man, you're way out of our league.
Ten dollars.
You're a pretty good player.
Let's cut out the small stuff, huh? Hundred dollar freeze-out. Ten games, ten bucks a game, winner take all. And then we'll see who quits.
Yes.
Around.
I've got nothing else to do on Tuesdays and Thursdays.
I drink.
Eleven o'clock... I'll be back later.
I'm not sure... I don't know.
At school. It's Thursday.
Thanks.
Museums... art galleries... concerts.
I'm getting treatments right here.
Take your choice. I've got enough so we won't have to go out of the house till Tuesday.
What's this supposed to mean: "We have a contract of depravity. All we have to do is pull the blinds down."
Me. It's Eddie.
Why did he tell you?
More like a week. Look, I'll be back.
Leave now.
Why should I?
Please, Eddie, don't beg him.
Game's over, Eddie.
I'm shootin' pool, Fats. When I miss you can shoot.
So do you, Fast Eddie.
Listen to me, my blood somehow... helped you.  It could help all of you.  We could find some way to --
It comes back.  Flashes.  My name.
My wife.
Yes.
You hunt us like animals -- do you know how many you have slaughtered?!
Yes.
Busy.  I went swimming and prepared a new vehicle.  A big vehicle.
Yes.
This can be your room if you want it. What do you say?
This should be the heaviest shower of the year.
And that one -- to the right of Rigel?
I don't know, Dad.  But it was big.
Sure ... fine.
It was all made of stuff that's happened to you in the last few days.  The sand pit in back of the house, and the meteor shower, and meeting your teacher and the colonel at school, and being afraid of the new kids because you don't know them ...
I will.  But isn't that odd -- about my dream ... ?
I'm sorry, Mr. Gardner.  I was out of my office for a minute and when I got back -- he was gone.
I understand, Miss, that you have my son in your office.
You people have a lot of nerve, taking it on yourselves to encourage young children to speak out of turn. I'm of a mind to pull him out of school if this is your idea of how to handle ... What sort of training do you have anyway?
I don't see anything.
Let's go look at the sand pit behind your house.
Hide the car.
They didn't find any signs of life on the Viking missions.
What?
You have to leave the White House.
You don't understand. You have to leave Washington.
I've worked with embedded loading. They're communicating with a hidden signal. They're going to attack...
He's not going to listen to me.
I wanted a career. Didn't you ever want to be part of something special?
Punched the President? Oh my god.
Please, would I be this panicked if it was that simple?
Huh? Oh, good, good.
Haven't you been watching?
Think. It's like in chess. First you strategically position your pieces. Then, when the timing's right. You strike.
You don't move soon. I'll begin to decompose.
Three years.
Can't this thing go any faster?
I just haven't found it yet. I tried C. Halbrook, Connie Halbrook, Spunky Halbrook...
It's perfect the line is busy?
What was it, Roswell? You had the space ship, the bodies, everything locked up in a bunker, the what is it, Area fifty one. That's it! Area fifty one. You knew and you didn't do nothing!
Oh shit, we're late.
Great.
Looks like they're preparing the invasion.
But Mr. President...
She should be shortly.
The helicopter never arrived at Nellis and there's been no radio contact.
ETA with target; four minutes.
Better than we thought.
Roger, Eagle One, our primary target has shifted course.
They cancelled it. Why are you acting like this?
Yes, I am.
Don't get premature on me, Jimmy. We don't light up 'til the Fat Lady sings.
It's all fuzzy.
We should leave too.
We must maintain a working government in a time of crisis...
Two words, Mr. President. Plausible deniability.
The other bombers might have more luck. We shouldn't just give up...
Here... now.
Peace? No peace.
Die.
And I am his.
Papers, sir. Got it here.
Egyptian Mail. Morning edition.  Run!
What is it?
I don't know. But someone must want it pretty badly.
Call Donovan, Marcus. Tell him I'll take that ticket to Venice now.
What?
No, Henry. Try not to talk.
How dare he?!
Eternal life, Doctor Jones! The gift of youth to whoever drinks from the Grail.  Oh, now that's a bedtime story I'd like to wake up to!
What good is it? This Grail Tablet speaks of deserts and mountains and canyons. Pretty vague. Where do you start looking? Maybe if the Tablet were intact, you'd have something to go on. But the entire top portion is missing.
Yes?
Looks like the best parts have already been spoken for.
I usually don't.
Lower me down.
He never would have made it past the rats! He hates rats! He's scared to death of them!
You had it? You didn't trust me!
How do you know?
So it did.
My father didn't want it incinerated.
Yet you stood up to be counted with the enemy of everything the Grail stands for -- who gives a damn what you think?
And the head.  You hit me, Dad!
Don't worry -- I'm fine.
Well, I am sorry about your head, though. But I thought you were one of them.
There were rats, Dad.
Yeah, big ones. What do the Nazis want with you Dad?
Yeah?
Well, uh...
She talks in her sleep.
So did I.
What?
What?
Brody's this way.
All right Dad -- tell me.
I don't know. The first available flight out of Germany.
Actually, I was a wonderful father.
Then what are you complaining about?  Look, we have work to do. When we get to Alexandretta we will face three challenges.  "First, the breath of God. Only the penitent man will pass. Second, the Word of God, only in the footsteps of God will he proceed. Third, the Path of God, only in the leap from the lion's head will he prove his worth."
What happens at eleven o'clock?
Thanks.
I know, Dad!
You call this archaeology?
Junior...
The penitent man will pass. The penitent... the penitent. The penitent man...
Penitent. Penitent...
That was seven hundred years ago.
Come on -- come on!
I'll take the camels.
But, Indy --
They have them. In the belly of that steel beast.
My soul is prepared. How's yours?
My name is Kazim.
The secret of the Grail has been safe for a thousand years. And for all that time the Brotherhood of the Cruciform Sword has been prepared to do anything to keep it safe.
Finally!
No -- you can't go! Something awful's happened. They've got Short Round and I think Indy's been --
It's some kind of cult! And they've got the sacred stones that Indy was searching for.
You should have been there...
No, no, that is Uhmed Singh, the present Maharajah's late father.
His Highness has not yet taken a wife.
I'm afraid they'll kill them! We saw horrible things down there -- they had a human sacrifice and they ripped a man's heart out!
Maybe... but how do you explain The Thuggee shrine I saw right below the palace?
And didn't the Sultan of Madagascar threaten to cut your head off if you ever returned to his country?
Kali Ma protects us now and for ever, and we must pledge our devotion by worshipping her with an offering of flesh and blood!
Nope, you got a little surprise over there, Shorty.
No.
Yeah, that's what happened...
Mola Ram -- you're about to meet Kali -- in Hell!
Hasn't the Pankot palace been deserted since the Mutiny of 1857?
I'm sorry, I don't know how I can help you here.
Hey, he's not a waiter...
Poison never agrees with me.  Pull a right, Short Round, and head for the Wang Poo bridge!
Siam.
Holy cow -- India? How do you know we're in --
He said that's whey they were at river -- they were waiting for the plane to fall down.
It was destined that I came here -- and the future cannot be changed...
Don't worry, I'm coming in! What is it?
Uh, listen -- Willie -- I got a better idea.
First of all -- don't panic!
What?!
I met Short Round when he tried to pick my pocket.
Oh, that's easy -- I'm going to latch onto a good-looking, incredibly rich prince.
Just try and control yourself.
You're dreaming, Willie. You want to make it real, just knock on my door.
I'm coming, what's the rush?! Ohh! What's that?! There's stuff all over the floor! I can't see a thing!
Willie!
Quiet!
You've got to go to sleep now.
You didn't do so well yourself. Finding that stone could've gotten you all the fortune and glory you were talking about.
They don't cry about you. They cry about the elephants leaving.
They got no food to feed them. So they taking the elephants away to sell them.
Willie, come on!
Don't do that.
It wasn't him.
Me.
Al.
What is your name?
Where are we?
Well...If you're in my head... to you, I'm...GOD!
It's my head, I'll be the judge of that. Anyway, who are you?
Me? What'd I do?
You said it.
Loading a gun.
Yeah.
Who was that? Somebody out there?
You gotta help.
We're a team...My...talent. Your... mobility.
Think of the scientific data we'll gain. Come on, lets get out of here.
Go out, take your first left.
Take a left and your next right.
That's it. They know I'm in here. We've got to find them.
They think we're safe here. They don't really need us. They're probably long gone.
Not who. A data bank. Just keep your ear to the phone and don't make a sound.
Send a man there. A secret agent.
You are not alone. But you are incon- picuous...and, with our abilities...
Use my credit cards.
Why not?
Nothing, but it's yours. Change it. Change your whole persona.
You'll be me.
For chrissakes, it's only sand. You should see some of the stuff that's floating around in here. That sand's the cleanest thing in you, including me. Now EAT it!
What was?
Follow it.
Don't just stand there, say something.
Wait.
No...you idiot!
Maybe they won't stand on ceremony.
But, you've got to have... sophistication ...savoir faire.
It is my business. It's my name.
You have no taste.
Pan the group, will you. If you're right, at least one of them...is involved.
What glasses.
The blond...GRUNER. A killer.
How do you know?
Your data must be bad. Everyone can't be lying all the time.
This just won't work.
Not her. You!
What if she says something important?
Joe! It's 56 hours!
Is that all?
No. What will you do.
Why don't you get out of my face.
That's good. It's not better. Where?
Follow her.
Drink lots of water.
You have to! Quickly!
Trying to analyze this stuff. Now...go to the medicine shelf and take ---- and ----.
Never mind, just say it.
You were with GRUNER!
Then why let her out of our sight? Besides, she's all we've got...
What exactly?
Losing power. The laser drained it.
We are in a dungeon. How do we get out?
Looks like you can have all you want.
Yeah, sure.
I mean it!  No one else would have helped. I take it all back, everything I've said about you.
Sending what we know back to U.S.T. via satellite.
It's all we've got.
Dieter?
I insist.
Trouble...is, if we both get stuck here.
What a nerve!
He work for us?
Private clinic. Best of care. Total privacy. We'll pay all costs.
Yes. Joe.
It's just money.
He's...more. Somehow, enhanced... He's...zxflbbgt!
Oh...that's okay.
Do what?
Yeah. If I remember anything... I call ...you
Who...are you?
How do I look?
Oh....Sure.
I feel fine.
Not you. Them.
Been hearing voices.
I said...I didn't say..anything!
Yes?
Without what?
You're talking to me.
You're doing...Okay.
And you, what do you like?
Sometimes. I told you I did.
Last night?
You did.
One chip?
How do you know you can trust me?
Oh sure.
...across THE BORDER. Come on!
You've  been there?
I can't fly it.
But you did it. It was you.
I told you, I work for him.
Thanks.
I can't get it out. It would take hours.
Tear it apart?
Leaving, now go to sleep. ...all of you.
It doesn't hurt.
That remote control thing?
Yes, baby?
I'll be there.
Lunch?
No, I'm questioning your hearing! You hear "reasonable" and "tortious interference." I hear... "Potential Brown & Williamson lawsuit jeopardizing the sale of CBS to Westinghouse." I hear... "Shut the segment down. Cut Wigand loose. Obey orders. And fuck off...!" That's what I hear.
C'mon, what are you? And are you a businessman? Or are you a newsman?! Because that happens to be what Mike and I do for a living...
Well, what do you think I'm going to do? Quit in protest? I'm not going to do that.
End up in a high-profile lawsuit with Lowell, the First Amendment martyr? I don't think so.  Take a look at this... This is a summary of a dossier that's being prepared.
Before you go...
We have a search warrant, Mr. Wigand. There's been a death threat.
How grave?
Well, with tortious interference, I'm afraid... the greater the truth, the greater the damage.
They own the information he's disclosing. The truer it is, the greater the damage to them. If he lied, he didn't disclose their information. And the damages are smaller.
You're getting ahead of yourself. We're all in this together. We're all CBS. We'll find out soon. Thank you, gentlemen.
Okay... About this whistle-blower... Did Mike and Don go along with the corporate decision?
Don't you have to be at the office?
I'm going to the store. You need anything?
Soy sauce...
That's my stuff from the office...
I told him that you had an E-mail death threat that said if you didn't shut the "F" up, they were going to kill you...
Where should I wash them?
What's the difference...
Can we talk about this when I get back?
"60 Minutes," the television show?
Jeffrey...
What's your interest in this, Mr. Bergman?
Well, would you want him to call you? Or, you want to call him? How do you want to do it?
Yeah.
What chance is there of getting Jeff's interview on the air...?
...and I'd be lying to you if I didn't tell you, I'm about out of moves, Dick...
Good, well ask him if Arabic is his second language.
Bring a tie so they'll let us in the front door...
"Put the corporation at risk"...? Give me a fucking break!
These people are putting our whole reason for doing what we do... on the line!
I took off on Tisch. I took off on corporate. They'll know they're not going to see everything on Sunday night...
Alright. What did you think?
No, I usually sit around in my hotel room, dressed like this at 5:30 in the morning, sleepy look on my face.
Oh, lots.
Oh, please, Mike...
That's good. That works.  Uh, you know, I want to ask you something... I know it sounds odd... but...
That's room service. They usually knock first.  Come on in... Over here, please.
Did work.
What are you talking about? Where are you?
I did not burn you. I did not give you up to anyone!
To straighten something out with you. Right here. Right now.
No. I did not. Big Tobacco is a big story. And you got something important to say. I can tell.  But, yes. I did. I came all the way down here to tell you: story, no story, fuck your story, I don't burn people.
Like what?
I can't talk about it. The work I was supposed to do... might have had some positive effect. I don't know... it could have been beneficial.  Mostly, I got paid a lot. I took the money. My wife was happy. My kids had good medical. Good schools. Got a great house.  I mean, what the hell is wrong with that...?
Yeah... Look, thanks for talking. I'm sorry I woke you up.
No.
You believe that because you get information out to people... something happens?
I don't think you really understand --
I have to put my family's welfare on the line here, my friend! And what are you puttin' up? You're puttin' up words!
They're terrorizing us. Death threats?! To my family? My kids?!
I'll call them, Lowell.
...they "volunteered." A friend owns a large security company.
What?!
ABC...?
I greased the rails for a guy who wanted to say yes. I helped him to say yes. Alright. You're not a robot, Jeff! That's all. You got a mind of your own, don't you?
I fought for you... and I still fight for you.
For example. James Burke, the CEO of Johnson & Johnson... when he found out that some lunatic had put poison in Tylenol bottles, he didn't argue with the FDA... He didn't even wait for the FDA to tell him. He just pulled Tylenol off every shelf of every store right across America. Instantly. And then he developed the safety cap... Because, look, as a CEO, sure, he's gotta be a great businessman, right? But he's also a man of science. He's not going to allow his company... to put on the shelf... a product that might hurt people.  Not like the Seven Dwarfs...
You called me.
Liane has filed for divorce...
In other words, you were charging Sandefur and Brown & Williamson with ignoring health considerations consciously...
When should we do this?
I'd rather play than talk about it.  What did you want to see me about? I don't like being back here.
...we worked together for, what was it, three years...? Now, the work we did here is confidential, not for public scrutiny... any more than are one's family matters...
He --
You did good, Massey!
You know, Miles, after my wife -- wife's mastectomy -- things were never the same. This might sound cold, well, maybe not to you, Massey, but...  I like my women with two boobs.
Who's the pigeon?
Who do you want me to kill?
Is that... one person?
Mr. Dumbarton is, yes.
No...
I'm sorry. That was unkind and -- but, we changed our minds.  Did you really mean what you said on the phone. It wasn't because you found out about Rex?
Why would you need two time zones? You never leave Beverly Hills.
Got any symptoms?
So, that's good, right?
Except for two years when he was in the Navy, in Korea.
Ruth Rabino.
It's about time.
What does your lawyer think?
Absolutely.
Have you tried the duck?
Although knowing you as I do -- there will be no settlement. This time it will be complete and total annihilation.
You're right about me. I am worthless. I am nothing. I don't deserve to live.
I live right near there. The 800 Block of Maple. Come here. Marylin -- come here right now before -- just come here.
No. No. I don't have a... no. It was from a client.
And your mother was very beautiful. She must be proud of you.
Don't go. Stay with me for a while.
Yes, Miles. I accept.
Do you want to sleep on it?
I know.
Yes. Short notice you know, but I think there's nice closure to it. Hello Judge Muson. A pleasure as always.
Fabric and fringe.
I'd just like to pick up a few of my things
That's true.
I'm not leaving you. I took self defense
It's not something I wanted either.
But Marylin, you know a divorce would ruin me right now. Everything I have -- everything we have -- is tied up in my business. The business is my entire life.
Marylin?
Marylin.
You have some?
Now? Well, Marylin, now you cut a deal or find out how Jean Harris made it work for her.
In the words of my Private Investigator, we're going to nail his ass.
Of Massey Myerson?
Oh, God!
They bought her speech. If I was only in it for Rex's money, he shouldn't have to give me any.
Hello Miles.
Yes, yes, it's just -- you know I've never been the first wife. Rex was married before me.
He tricked you. With a phony wife and a fake pre-nup. Howard Doyle. He got you. You married Marylin, didn't you? You thought she had money. HA HA HA. Howard Doyle made you think that because of what you did to me. And to Marylin Rexroth. Yeah. I heard all about it. My brother Howard Doyle got you.  Neener neener neener.
My client proposes a thirty day cooling off period.
My client is prepared to settle for fifty percent of the marital assets.
Marylin was friends with Howard and Amanda Doyle. They don't like the way you operate. They helped her.
We've outlined a settlement...
No. Not exactly. It didn't exactly cool. Marylin is a knock-out. And very sexy -- but -- there's a lot of it out there.
I'm not sure.
That's the problem. I can't afford to give her anything.
Nothing.
The plastic surgeon! I read about you in LA Style.
-- the coin?
She's keeping his name. And one of his planes. And all seven of his children
Yes, sir?
Yes sir. If you'll excuse me, sirshe sent me for a drink.  Andrews stands a moment thoughtfully and then starts up the stairs, following which the scene dissolves to the UPSTAIRS CORRIDOR in front of Ellie's door. Andrews enters and knocks several times. Receiving no response, he gingerly opens the door.
Yeah.
If I didn't I wouldn't be here!  I've got it all itemized. 
The reward.
I'm afraid I'm a little confused. You see, I assumed you were coming here for
Do you love her?
I won't stand for it! I won't stand for your running my life! Why do you insist on it!
Sorry, Dad. I wouldn't hurt you for the world. You know that.
It'll do no good.  He despises me.
Oh, please, Dad
Well, if it isn't the groom himself! You're just in time, King.
All right. That's why I sent for you.  There's a room full of reporters out there. I want you to make a statementthat you've had a talk with methat we've reached an understandingthat if Ellen comes home, I won't interfere with your marriage. Will you do that?
Yessir. She refuses them all.
You've made that quite evidentwith all your threats of annulment.  Well, it hasn't bothered me for a minute. Ellie and I got married because we love each other. And she's proving it; as far as I'm concerned there's going to be no annulment.
No?  Say, listenI've devoted a whole lifetime trying to tame that wildcat. Toughest job I ever tackled. Ever hear of J.P. Clarkson? Biggest man in the country, isn't he? Well, I tamed him . Got him eating out of the palm of my hand. I've browbeaten financiers, statesmen, foreign ministerssome of the most powerful people in the worldbut I've never been able to do a thing with her. She's been too much for me. I'm glad you think it's easy.  Now listenif you'll do what I tell you, perhaps I might develop a little respect for you. You never can tell.
I haven't the slightest idea.
But it's King Westley on the phone.
What happened to your money?
Tonsil? Me? No! Me burn a tonsil?  "My tonsils won't burn As life's corners I . . .
. . . turn."
Oh, I see, young people in love are never hungry.
Huh?
Hey, whadda you tryin' to dokid me?
What're you gonna do about the papers? Somebody's gotta pick 'em up.
Fresh guy, huh! What you need is a good sock on the nose.
You win!
Are you talking to me?
Wellof all thewell  Maybe you'll be interested to know your bag's gone.
Yeah. I knew you'd catch on eventually.
Don't tell me your ticket was in it?
Why, you ungrateful brat!
I found it on the seat.
What are you talking about?
I didn't ask for your advice. 
Beat it! 
Yeah. Yeah, it's a gift. 
Oh, I forgot to tell you. I registered as Mr. and Mrs. 
Who, me?  Why, I'm the whippoorwill that cries in the night. I'm the soft morning breeze that caresses your lovely face.
Yeah. I got a name. Peter Warne.
I met some very interesting women at the showers. We got to chatting about this and that. You know how time files.
I know a couple of truck drivers I'd like to have you meet sometime.  Come on, sit down.
What makes you so disgustingly cheerful this morning?
Just shows you how wrong a guy can be. Doughnut?
Peter Warne, you've gone far enough. I won't stand being insulted like this another minute.
You always want to run everything.
I'm following you.
Yes.
And rich people have none of those qualifications, I suppose.
All right! Don't take them off. Do whatever you please. But shut up about it.
What?
Doesn't sound very exciting.
By a strange coincidence, I was thinking of you.
You're an expert, I suppose.
There's no end to your accomplishments.
Oh, no!
You're such a smart aleck! Nobody can do anything but you. I'll show you how to stop a carand I won't use my thumb.
Just a road thief. Picks people up and runs off with their stuff. What a racket! 
Yeah. He finally agreed to let us have a room.
Okay.  Cottage Number Three.
I love you.
You bet I did.
Same to you.
I would. But I've got a weak stomach.
Goodnight, Mr. Warne. 
Sorry, Miss. It's gone.  Ellie's face clouds. The crowds surge about her. She looks around thoughtfully. Suddenly her eyes open in surprise at something she sees, and the VIEW then moves over to Peter, who sits on his suitcase, looking toward Ellie.
Oh, thank you. Thank you very much.  Here.
Thank you.
Husband?
Serves you right. Oughta be careful who you take up with on the road. You can't go plyin' your trade in my camp.
Get out!
Wait a minute, GordonI
To tear down the Walls of Jericho.
Wait a minute, Joe. Use your bean. I couldn't afford to hand you a phoney yarn, like that. I'd be crazy. There isn't a newspaper in the country'd give me a job after that! I could go to jail!
Okay, pete. 
Blamed if I know. I just brung 'em a trumpet.
I dunno.
Zeke.  Git!
Hey, you!
I'd like to sit with myuhwifeif you don't mind. 
That's right.
What?
You're a pretty shrewd baby.  We better get away from this gang. Talk this thing over privately.
You're not making any mistake, believe you me.
Whyno
But I'm a married man. I got a couple of kids. I can't get mixed up with
I won't say anything. Honest, I won't.
Oh, gee, Misteryou wouldn'tyou ain't thinkin' about
SuresureI'll keep my trap shut. you can depend on me, Mister.
No.
The interesting thing is the extent to which the Warren Commission went to make him a Communist.  They got almost 150 pages and 130 exhibits of the report on this Mexico trip and the picture doesn't even match.  I'm beginning to think the point of the Mexican episode was to lay the blame at Castro's door.  If Oswald, or someone purporting to be Oswald, had gotten into Cuba, come back, then killed the President, the American public once again would've screamed for a Cuban invasion...
Chief, sometimes I don't know whether you're kidding or not.
Grab your socks and pull... Clay Bertrand is Clay Shaw...
Not unless we go for Shaw now.
So why does he call himself Bertrand?
At 7:30 Sunday morning?  It's not exactly fresh blood we're sniffing here, boss.
The murder of a President, Bill, is a crime in Orleans Parish too.  I didn't pick you because of your legal skill, you know.
Maybe 'cause there's some rogue element in the Government!
Not in a routine autopsy, but if we looked at the spinal fluid, there might be a high level of iodine, but it's difficult to know.  Whatcha thinkin', Jim?
What are you talking about, Dave? You weren't mentioned in the story. Don't jump to conclusions.
Dave, you know that's where this road leads.
I don't have much time.  They don't even need bugs anymore.  They got these fuckin' satellite waves.  They put a bug in a friend of mine when he was born, right up his nostrils, subcutaneous, between his eyes.  He was one of those products of a crossbreading experiment.  A Nazi rocket scientist father and a Commie spy mother.  You'd never believe half the shit the Agency does.  I'm so fuckin' tired.  Haven't slept since that shit article came out. Why'd you guys have to go and get me involved with this?
How could I?  Dave, as you know, President Kennedy was assassinated on Friday.  A man named Lee Harvey Oswald was arrested as a suspect and then was murdered yesterday by a man named Jack Ruby.  We've heard reports that Oswald spent the summer in New Orleans and we've been advised you knew Oswald pretty well.
But you are aware, he served in your Civil Air Patrol unit when he was a teenager.
I'm sure you've seen this.  Perhaps you knew this man under another name?
Well that must've been mistaken information we got.  Thanks for straightening it out for us.  There is one other matter that's come up, Dave.  We were told you took a trip to Texas shortly after the assassination of Friday.
What was so appealing about Houston?
But the boys told us they didn't get any.
Dave, I find your story simply not believable.
I had the cause of death.
What?
Well, I am saying it.  Bring in the jury.
Well, it looks like it, Jasper.
Look, do you want the truth, or just what you want me to say?
No, I saw a guy shooting from over there.  He was behind that fence. What are you going to do about it?
Negative on his tax records. Classified.  First time I know a D.A. can't get a tax record.  I put together a list of all the CIA files on Oswald that were part of the Warren Report and asked for them.  There are about 1200 documents...  Oswald in the USSR, in Mexico City, Oswald and the U2, a CIA 201 personnel file, a memo from the Director on Oswald, travel and activities - can't get one of them.  All classified as secret on the grounds of national security.  It's real strange.
Makes sense - he's a spokesman.
None!  The State Department issues him a new passport in 48 hours and loans him the money to travel.  He's never investigated or charged by the Navy for revealing classified information or, as far as we know, debriefed by the CIA.
Dammit, it doesn't add up!  Ordinary people get blacklisted for leftist affiliations!  The State Department did everything short of dispatching a destroyer to Minks to insure Oswald's return.  Only intelligence people can come and go like that.
I wonder about the Williams'.  Just where did the first description of Oswald come from at 12:44?  No one knows.  They claimed it was Brennan's, but his description came after 1 P.M.  Who called?  Somehow the FBI's been tapping the Williams' and picks up a call between Bell Helicopter and Janet's phone, an unidentified voice saying "We both know who's responsible."  Who called?  Why's the Bureau been tapping them?
This is interesting - are you ready for this?  Oswald went to see the FBI two weeks before the assassination.  It seems Special Agent Hosty made three routine visits to his house, supposedly to keep an eye on Marina Oswald.
Mr. O'Keefe told us he met you at the Masquerade Bar down in the Quarter and several evenings later you had him over for dinner at your apartment on Dauphine Street.  Do you recall that?
It adds a taste of elegance for which I must confess a weakness for now and then.  I call him Smedley.  His real name is Frankie Jenkins - but I could hardly imagine anything more uncouth during dinner than my turning toward the kitchen and hollering "Frankie!" .. Where is this leading to, Mr. Garrison?
...and that the four of you partied early into the morning hours...
I've spent half my life in the United States military serving and defending this great country, Mr. Shaw, and you're the first person I ever met who considered it an act of patriotism to kill his own president.
Yes, it was about 11 in the morning. I was driving west on Elm Street toward the Triple Underpass, in a rented car - a blue Valiant.  I'll never forget that day.
But why in the Lord's name would you do it in the middle of Easter Sunday when you knew we were...
Look at the calendar, for Christ's sake.  You said a Sunday, not Easter Sunday.
You're missing most of your life, Jim, and you don't even know it. The kids are missing out too.  It's not just you making the sacrifice here, honey.
Tough day.
Liz, I'm really sorry.  The meeting went much longer than expected.
It's going to get worse, honey.
Your daughter's life was just threatened!
I'm leaving.  I'm taking the kids and I'm leaving!  I won't stand it anymore.
I'm not fighting you, Jim, I'm just trying to reach you.  You've changed.
Oh, I don't know anymore!  I believe there was a conspiracy, but not the government.  I just want to raise our children and live a normal life! I want my life back!
Well... yeah.
Let's get outta here, Lou.  I saw too much stuff like this in the war.
Lou, you were in the Marines.  Who would be running that training?
And it ain't pretty  ..."the AD has spent more than $8,000 on unexplained travel and investigative expenses since November, 1966.
Between six and seven seconds.
Why not just shoot Kennedy coming up Houston?  There's plenty of time - he's out in the open - a frontal shot?
Beats me.  City officials.  Secret Service.  Dallas police.  They did a dry run with Chief Curry a few days before.  But they didn't bother running through Dealey.  They stopped right there, said something like, "and afterwards there's only the freeway," and went home.
You sure got it.  You're one stubborn and stupid sonofabitch D.A. and you're making one hell of a mistake!
If I were investigatin', I'd round up the 100 best riflemen in the world and find out which ones were in Dallas that day.  You been duck hunting?  I think Oswald was a good old-fashioned decoy.  What'd he say?  "I'm just a patsy."  Out of the mouth of babes y'ask me.
I've been called everything under the sun, Jerry.  Call me whatever you like.
You didn't get that break you needed, but you went as far as any man could, bubba.  What can I do for you?
I think it started in the wind. Money - arms, big oil, Pentagon people, contractors, bankers, politicians like L.B.J. were committed to a war in Southeast Asia.  As early as '61 they knew Kennedy was going to change things... He was not going to war in Southeast Asia.  Who knows? Probably some boardroom or lunchroom somewhere - Houston, New York - hell, maybe Bonn, Germany... who knows, it's international now.
Ever ask him?
...some story... the whole thing. It's like it never happened.
More than ten years.
If you buy what you read in the paper.
I didn't say that.  All I know is he died suddenly just before the Warren Report came out.
Well, I guess now that Guy's dead, it don't really matter... it was about the people hanging around the office that summer.  I wasn't really part of the operation, you know.  I was handling the private-eye work for Guy when that came in - not much did - but that's why I was there... it was a nuthouse.  There were all these Cubans coming and going.  They all looked alike to me.
And Oswald?
There was one guy, I don't know, big guy, business guy, white hair - I saw him come into the office once. He looked out of place, y'know - like a society guy.  Can't remember his name.  Oswald was with him.
It's a contradiction, Numa, get used to them.  The only explanation for the royal treatment is he did give them radar secrets.  Or fake secrets.
I expected that two months ago, and they're wasting their time... The bad news is the National Guard has just asked me to resign after 18 years.  Well, maybe that's good news - it was never as good as combat, but this is.  Bill, any more on Oswald and Shaw?
Less than you would guess.  Most days two to three assistant D.A.'s. A handful of police investigators.
That's it.
How long do you think it would take me to be appointed?
Yes?
Yes.
No, that could not be done, Mr. Ruby. There are a good many things involved in that.
Well, the public attention it would attract.  And we have no place for you there to be safe, we're not law enforcement officials, and many things are at stake in this affair, Mr. Ruby.
I went. I did. I took my mother and little brother.
I understand.
If that's what they want to do, they're doin' it.
That's not what they're tellin' me.
Naw, man. I gotta be someplace. I was kinda hopin you could come with me.
I can't believe you do me this way.
I went to give him his refund, so he wouldn't have to come here.
I told Jackie, and Jackie said you wanted him.
Hey, Jackie.
She hasn't one into specifics yet, she's been waiting for you.
Sure.
You have the right to say "no." And I have the right to make you wait here with Ray while I go get a warrant. And if I don't want to go through all that trouble, I could just take you in on suspicion.
If I were to tell you "no it isn't..."
Arrest me.
We could stop at the Hilton by the airport.
So far I've been told I can cooperate and get probation, maybe. Or, I can stand mute and get as much as five years. Does that sound right?
Sure.
It was the other guy who busted me.
I have a pretty good idea. Ordell ain't no bootlegger and I doubt he's smugglin' Cuban cigars. So that only leaves one thing an A.T.F. man would be interested in.
You went out this morning and bought a gun?
Yeah.
Sure.
It looks nice.
The Delfonics.
How'd you find that out?
What?... What'd you do?
Why?
Same way I been doin', but first they got to let me go back to work.
It's not really something I think about.
You know, I can't really feel too sorry for you in that department.
Bigger?
They seem to like the idea.
Yeah, we were goin' over everything. That's why all the bags.
He weren't bullshittin' either, 'cause later he was suspended and forced to retire.
If I saw a way to walk off with a shopping bag full of money, would I take it?
Okay, sure. I might be tempted. Especially now, since I'm getting out of the bail bonds business.
When did you decide?
The day you got me out of jail?
I believe I said I'd be tempted.
It may be evidence once they get their hands on it, but right now it's only money.
You know, a good cop won't let you know he knows you're fulla shit.
Don't be so literal. Ray believed it.
Well, you know I'm not going to show him the whole amount. He'll see fifty thousand.
Set him up.
Why?
I didn't say you did.
You'll get over that.
Start off in Madrid. Ever been there?
I beg your pardon?
And cooperate? You might get probation.
Then you don't see him for a few days?
What the fuck is that shit?
You never asked me if I did or not.
He sells guns.
What are you doing?
You talk to him?
Ever meet her, or they talk about her?
Who's the other one?
And splittin' with her?
Oh, that's taken care of. I called the State Attorney's Office. You were no-filed this morning in Circuit Court.
I was told ten thousand in each pack.
Buy ya a beer?
Good luck. That guy's been in there since I got here.
Great...  ...Wanda!
Better get me another Sam's.  Join me in a Jaeger shot?
Gimme one anyway.
Kinda.
Do you got something for me?
They asked.
I didn't tell 'em anything.
I said, you understand what I'm saying
All your money's in Mexico.
I don't think so, but it don't really matter. They know I'm meeting you.
Naw, naw, that's too much exposure. I ain't goin anywhere near that money.
Yeah, I think a woman.
I suppose you see a piece of this for yourself?
I'll give ya ten.
I need to talk to you alone.
Designer clothes.
Ray, the A.T.F. guy.
I can sit through it once.
Bank robbery.
It's a diet thing?
The roller disco one.
No.
You live with him.
Uh-huh?
Just stay right fuckin' here, all right?
Okay, you got it. Just take a chill pill, for christ sake.
This one.
Okay, Lou-is.
What's your cost?
That's good money.
Oh, I dunno. Watching TV.
I dunno.
He put himself in a situation where he was gonna have to do ten years in the penetentiary, that's what he did.  And if you know Beaumont, you know there ain't no way in hell he can do no ten years. And if you know that, you know Beaumont's gonna go any goddam thing Beaumont can to keep from doin' those ten years including telling the Federal government everything they want to know about my ass. Now that, my friend, is a clear case of him or me. And you best believe it ain't gonna be me. You know what I'm sayin'? You gonna come in on this with me, you gotta be prepared to go all the way. I got me so far over a half-a-million dollars sittin' in lockboxes in a bank in Cabo San Lucas. Me and Mr. Walker make us one more delivery, I'm gonna have me over a million. You think I'm gonna let this little cheese eatin' nigga here fuck that up? Shit, you better think again. 'Fore I let this deal get fucked up, I'll shoot that nigga in the head, and ten niggas look just like em.  Understand what I'm sayin'?
But you did have a Salvation Army- thing going.
Sure.
She one of the women I got set up. I got Melanie in Hermosa Beach. I rent Simone a small house in Compton, and about four blocks away I got me this nineteen-year-old country girl named Sheronda. I found her waitin' for a bus two days outta Alabama, barefoot, country as a chicken coop. Took her to my house in Compton, told her it was Hollywood.
That's not what I meant when I asked did you trust her.
I told you, man.  She my fine little surfer gal.
Hang it up, she's on her way. You gotta listen to this. This involves you.
Did you get it?
You know how she is.
What?
Look, I swear to fucking god, she came out with that bag and I took it from her.
That's right.
If she's got it, why didn't she take it all?
Do Max Cherry and Jackie Brown know each other?
Why should I think anything's weird, if I don't know nothin' about them knowing each other?
Where would you like me to put my ash?
Gonna have to put up cash.
Livingston, huh?
Will they consider this a violation of his probation?
Man, he won't like that. Beaumont don't got a doin' time disposition.
They fuckin' wit' her. They callin' it Possession with Intent. A black woman in her forties gets busted with less than two ounces on her, they call that shit Intent. Same shit happened to a movie star. It's Possession.
What?
The stewardess. Do you know her last name?
Beaumont worked for you.
Was she?
You're not my client until you get busted and I bond you out.
You want me to speculate on what you do. I'd say you're in the drug business, except the money's moving in the wrong direction. Whatever you're into, you seem to be getting away with it, so more power to you. Okay you want another bond, and you want to move over the ten thousand you put down on Beaumont to the stewardess. That means paperwork. I have to get a death certificate, present it to the court, fill out a receipt for return of bond collateral, then type up another application. An indemnity agreement --
Looky here, I know you helped her and I know you know what I want. Jackie can tell me any story come in that pretty head of hers. Long as at the end of that story, she hands over my money. She do that, we're still friends. Now, she don't wanna be my friend no more, tell her to think about ol' Louis. And if she tries to turn me in, I'll name her ass as my accessory. We'll go upstate together. Hand in handcuffed hand. Now that shit's a promise, understand what I'm sayin'? You tell her that, and I'll call you back.
Git your ass in here.
She wants to give you your money. If she didn't, there'd be cops batter- ramming the door right now.
Winston found you.
Lift up your pant leg. You help her?
You get used to it after a while. Now tell me where my money's at.
Let me speak to Max Cherry.
Give me his home number.
There is no out of here. You've been killed. Don't you remember?
No! That was years ago! I've lived years since then.
Della?
Just to see you. That's all.
Like Della.
Hello, Sam.
Gabe?  What are you doing ... ?
It was the window.
Don't go?  I'm not going anywhere. I'm right here, Gabe.  Come on, go back to sleep. You can still get a couple of hours.
Ah! I thought you were a mailman.
Am I dead, Louis?  Am I dead?
I was in Hell. I've been there. It's horrible. I don't want to die, Louis.
What? By myself?
Not tonight, Louis. No more rest.
I haven't seen her in months.
See them?  What do you mean? Physically?
Have you considered a doctor? A psy- chiatrist?
I don't know what to say.
Jacob Singer.
Where to?
No. Have you seen my glasses?
Jezzie, I can't see.
Why you left.
Just gettin' rid of the garbage.
How's it going?
Why do you bring her up?
Where are we?
Where's Della? Bring her here?
If I could stop it, I'd stop it.
That's your decision.
In a way. At least now I have some idea of what was happening. If we can only get them to admit ... to explain what they did ... I don't know. Maybe it'd clear things up in my head. I'll tell you something, Jez, honestly ... I thought they were real.
What's he talking about?
Jezzie?
Let go!
A chemist. Part of a chemical warfare unit out of Saigon. He said he knows me and that I'll know him when I see him.
Me neither.
It's not practical, Jez. It'll be hard enough alone.
No. Things are too hot. Later. I'll send for you.
Sit down, Jake.
Sit down.
It's over, Jake. It's all over.
Cause you know goddamn well who I am.
What do you want me to say? My mother's tummy?
Sit down, Jake.
Sit down!
It's over, Jake. It's all over.
Long time ago.
Yeah, sure. We were losing the war.
Like it was yesterday.
That's what I'd like to know. If you see him on the street somewhere, tell him he's fired.
If you're lucky.
Total delirium.
Why the hell we drivin' here?
Why not?
What do you mean?
They keep telling me I'm already dead, that they're gonna tear me apart, piece by piece, and throw me into the fire.  I carry these everywhere but they don't help. Nothing helps. Everyone thinks I'm crazy. My mother filed a report with the army.
She said I haven't been the same since then. Since that night. There's still this big hole in my brain. It's so dark in there, Jake. And these creatures. It's like they're crawling out of my brain. What happened that night? Why won't they tell us?
They're monsters, Jake. We're both seein' 'em. There's gotta be a connection. Something.
Pour it in.
Punk?
Yes it does.
THat's the sound of deep space attacking the integrity of the ship.
What if we blow the walkways first? Leave Jason over here to go up with the ship?
Explosive. We're blowing the walkway.
Somebody's gonna have to go back to the engine room.
Briggs, Geko, movement beyond the boxed fuselage.
Two more charges to go.
Er, guys. Where's the Hockey Player?
Thorgan? You coming?!
I don't know!
I am an expert!
Well, when we rejuvenate this one you can ask her.
My job.
Looks like we're missing two. Stone and Kkinsa.
No, you're dead! You're all dead!
Kicker, Sven. Get into the grid and tell me what the hell is going on!
Look! Just get everyone together, get off the ship... and then blow it to kingdom fucking come! That's the only way you're going to live.
Don't go out there. You can't win. We need to get off this ship. That's all there is to it.
Isn't there an escape POD on this ship? Something?
Med-kit?
Were you close to your father?
That sounds like Rizzo having faith in some of that future shit.
She needs a little time.
No shit. I got no problem with that.
I'm thinking Rizzo was right.
Just come on, I've got an idea.
NO!
Keep your shirt on! I'm working on it. You won't believe what we found.  Adrienne! Stoney!
Alright, relax. 20 minutes. Soon as we've passed Tara's rings we'll make the course correction.
Would you?
Teleportation? Some way to beam us the hell out of dodge?
Sergeant, we could use a big bomb.
Kay-em 14.
Are there any other shuttles?
Yes, I've reprogrammed you. You are very brave. Bad ass.
Defense droids. I'm on it.
No! He's coming with us!
Ssh.
Then open the doors!
What?!!
We just left old Earth. You'll never believe what we found.
Yeah, yeah if this is another ancient Farrari . . .
We've had Nano-Tech for the last 30 years.
JASON?! WHERE IS HE?!
Why don't you get it? He's going to kill us all!
You wanna die?
Rizzo, a shuttle out in the middle of space? We'll die oout there.
What?
All right, Commissioner. But when we're on my ship, I am Master, Mate and Pilot. And I want him...  ...along for ballast.
What I do is trick him to the surface, got that? Then I can jab him, understand?  Think I'm gonna haul it in as if he's a catfish, like everyone else does?
What do we do? Get some help? Radio in?
You hired me, remember? It's my $10,000. It's my shark...
Shut up! Just pump her out!
Full throttle! To port!
In Amity, you say 'Yahd.' 
Ow.  He's gotta be more careful in the water...
Do I need any more authority?
All I'm saying is that Amity is a summer town -- we need summer dollars, and if they can't swim here, they'll use the beaches at Cape Cod, or Long Island.
What kind of a shark did you say it was?
Why?
About half of them. A lot of 'missing swimmers' are really shark victims.
Rogue?
You could say that.
What stinks so bad?
Just as I thought. He drifted up here with the Gulf Stream, from southern waters.
What do we do?
It is a job. I'm not fooling around like some amateur. It's my life!
Be careful, for chrissake.
Out there is a Perfect Engine, an Eating Machine that is a miracle of evolution -- it swims and eats and that's all. Look at that! Those proportions are correct.  I know sharks.
I can't stand here doing nothing!
Do I set the goddam hook?
You're leaving?
Like those Cousteau specials on television? I think it's for the kids, but I love them.
Are you now. I know about porkers in the water --  Here. Tie me a sheepshank.
Real fine stuff but it won't mean a thing to Mr. Whitey, of course... he didn't go to schools in electronics. He was born with what he does best. Eat. He's a swimming appetite. 'Course he might eat this stuff, but then I've seen him eat a rocking chair, too.  Next time, ask me.
Look, maybe this is the wrong time to pursue this, but I'm not sure...
I don't think so.
I don't know...
I thought I might, you know, nip it in the bud before it gets worse. Because I heard in health class that pregnancy often results in an infant.
I did the prep questions for this lab last night. You can copy my answers if you need to.
I don't mind. You definitely bring something to the table.
I always think you're cute. I think you're beautiful.
Well, I do.
I totally heard you did.
I'm not mad. I'm in a fucking great mood. Despite the fact that I'm trapped in a fat suit I can't take off, despite the fact that everyone is making fun of me behind my back, despite the fact that your little girlfriend gave me the stinkeye in art class yesterday...
Not this time. You don't have any reason to be mad at me. You broke my heart. I should be royally ticked at you, man. I should be really cheesed off. I shouldn't want to talk to you anymore.
Yeah. That was me.
That's all I need from you. That's more than I could ever ask for. You're just golden, dude.
You are always trying to keep it real. I'm in love with how you feel. I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.
Yup.
Yup.
What are you talking about?
No, I mean the father! Who's the father, Juno?
Well, I was just asking. It seemed plausible.
Well, honey, doctors are sadists who like to play God and watch lesser people scream.
Oh. Uh, my stepmom took me to the doctor yesterday and they said I was twelve weeks.
No Josh, I don't take orders. Not from you and not from any man.
Technically, that would be kickin' it Old Testament.
Sorry. I was just getting something.
You should be happy, Holmes. I'm giving you and Vanessa the gift of life. Sweet, screaming, pooping life! And you don't even have to be there when the baby comes out of me all covered in...
Blood and guts.
Sorry. I swear I'm not a gear snob.
'93. I'm telling you that was the best time for rock and roll.
I don't know. Something to do with the four-packs...  ...They're not bad.
Oh, is he bald and amorphous?
You know... it's parts...
Yeah?
It's only my favorite song. It's Sonic Youth doing "Superstar" by the Carpenters.
Hey, I like this.
I didn't. But it's a three-way tie between the Stooges, Patti Smith and the Runaways.
You know, not many teenage girls in your situation would actually go through with this.
So, I've been spending a lot of time listening to that weird CD you made me.
Well, when you're used to the raw power of Iggy and the Stooges, everything else sounds kind of precious by comparison.
Okay, stop surfing porn and get back to work. Just wanted to say hi.
You're gonna like this, I promise.
But you're old!
Vanessa, right?
A Maker's Mark, please. Up.
Yeah, but I hardly noticed it. I'm more worried about the part where I have to start wearing jeans with an elastic panel in the front.
Well, you're lucky it's not you.
Can I use the facilities first? Being pregnant makes you pee like Seabiscuit.
So, then, you really think you're going to go ahead with this?
What do you mean? You mean...  Do you think I'm going to flake out on you?
Just, you know, shopping with my girlfriends.
Happy? Oh, you mean like, physically. I'm good. Look, I have a snooze button now!
Nothing.
My dad used to be in the Army, but now he's just your average HVAC specialist. He and my mom got divorced when I was five. She lives on a Havasu reservation in Arizona...
No, no, I'm definitely not asking for anything. Except maybe mercy. Like, it would be really great if nobody hit me.
The baby? I don't know anything about it yet. I only know it's got fingernails, allegedly.
Yeah, well, there's this couple who've been trying to have a baby for five years.
I have no idea what kind of girl I am.
I also have good teeth. No cavities. We finally got fluoridated water in Dancing Elk.
Well, no... I'm not going to sell the baby. I just want it to grow up with people who are ready to love it and be parents. I'm in high school, dude. I'm ill-equipped.
Bren took Liberty Bell to her tot ice skating class.
You mean like couples?
Tore up from the floor up?
I drank like ten tons of Sunny Delight. Anyway, yeah. I'm pregnant. And you're shockingly cavalier.
I know. Women Now, I guess. The commercial says they help women now.
It was magnificent, man!
I know. Maybe they'll canonize me for being so selfless.
Come on, Leah. I can't scope out wannabe parents in the Penny Saver! That's tacky. That's like buying clothes at the Pump n' Munch.
Yeah, but it sucks for free.
I'm pregnant.
No way. No, I definitely don't want to know.
You sound shocked or something.
Right, seriously.
Well, I was born to be a mother. Some of us are.
Are you looking for any other compensation?
Juno just wanted a closer look at Kimber here.
Of course we're ready. We've taken all the classes. The nursery. The books --
It all just happened so fast. We put that ad in the paper. I thought it would take months if, you know, ever and then -- boom -- Two weeks later, she's in our living room.
Me neither. How 'bout you Carrie?
I suppose anything's possible.
Adele... we gotta do something before Early kills someone else.
Karma.
...Yeah, sure.
Early Grayce if this ain't your lucky day.
He whips you?
I haven't... I'm a fast learner.
You can?
No it is not!
Sorry. Boy I'll tell ya, if Early found a picture of me like that I'd be black and blue for a week.
...That's not true.
Well Dorothy, why don't you hand me that chili there.
Almost.
What'll we do out there?
I heard that.
They ain't dangerous Adele. They're writers.
It's Chinese food. It was the only place open. You said you was starving, you'd eat anyth...
She had a dream that somethin' like this was gonna happen.
Walter Livesy.
Vernon, Florida.
Best kind.
That's a good idea. Unfortunately most of them have been executed.
...Then some.
Dahlia, no.
Hell yeah! I'll even spot ya a few points first game.
If you say so.
Forget about it, doesn't matter.
The party?
...just like that?
A book on the warehouse murders?
Hey, I got some great stuff... it's okay.
I heard that.
Fuck!
Look again!
A copy of a tape they found. He recorded everything.
Why, what did he do?
What the fuck is wrong with you Brian!? If you'll stop taking notes for once and open your eyes... you'll see that he is a homicidal fucking killer. He is... for real!
Shut your mouth.
...That'd be my guess.
Well now I'd say that's the least of Mr. Diebold's problems.
Yes.
Yes!
Yeah.
Right.
Yeah.
Den less go Joe.
Yep.
Can I do it? I just broke her cherry. I imagine I can make her do anything. Bark like a dog, jump through a ring of fire.
Man I haven't seen her in forever. What the fuck's she up to?
Oh. You like her?
I know what you mean.
I guess so. I gotta stop off home too.
I'm telling you the truth. And after that, I've always givin' my money to retards. Because that's the reverse of what he did.
Hold up man.
Don't look for him. He's doing fine. He's gotta girl. He's fuckin' her right now in Steven's parents' room. So do ya know Joe.
I don't know. But all I know is that I kicked him so many times my fuckin' toe feels broken.
Nuffin' G. Just forget it.
Come on bitch. Throw your fists up.
Hold on.
Yeah. I can understand that.
I don't know. I'm supposed to go to Nasa tonight.
But I'm scared Telly.
Nothing?
No, Fidget, I...
Because I'm a virgin and I don't want no baby.
You're OK?
No.
Yeah?
Thanks.
I knew he wouldn't want to speak to me. That dick.
Hell yeah, they don't know.
Good luck.
Don't go anywhere. Stay with me.
Yeah?
I no understand you. Maybe crazy.
Yep.
Yeah. Fifteen minutes to a half an hour. Hard and deep.
You think so?
It's not his fault. He had a hard life.
Hi Telly. Where you been?
But then I won't need your money.
Shh.
Four-thirty in the morning?
Everywhere. Fuckin' flophouse. We're still short on the rent. If you want, you and Casper can move in. You guys can share the bathtub.
Yep.
That shit is nothin'. I remember, I had just turned 14. With this fuckin' asshole who was like 18. I don't even remember his name. I think it was John or Jake or something. I remember he had a brother named Lentil because I would always joke and call him Lentil Bean. This was away at like sleep away camp with your friends and shit.
And we were like underneath the sheets. We were going at it like crazy. Oh my God that shit was so good! It was like hard...
Yo, let me get in your parent's room man. Just fir a little while.
Come on Steven hook me up. Do me this solid.  Come on man. I gotta get Darcy alone. She's gonna let me fuck her man. Please.
Let's see how much he wants to play.
I wouldn't know.
I'm positive.
Sit down!
You're right, I can't make you do it. Besides, you're probably gonna be too busy with the Franchise Tax Board anyway.
I gotta friend over there.  He was telling me things are kind of slow. So, I figured I'd give him a call, have him come down here and look through your records.  You know, give him something to do.
I'm sorry, this is just too convenient.
Find him!  I want to talk to him.
I don't know.  Maybe there's two of them.  Maybe he hired some Wino to make the calls.
Did anyone look suspicious?  Think!
You couldn't find your dick in a wind storm!
Did you know her?
You're not going to tell me that.
You're not playing very well.  There are clues all around you and you keep missing them.
Please, I don't want to get into the psychological aspects of my actions. It would detract from the game.
You heard me.  Why did you go out to the institute looking for her?
Very good.  How did you know?
You don't understand.
Oh, I put a few games on for your daughter.  I hope you don't mind.
Mister Sanderson, they'll be hundreds of thousands of games.
Fuck off!
Uh huh.
I can't sleep.  My beds lumpy.
Nothing.
Not much.  There's no sign of a break in.  I think she let him in.
There's only two hardware stores on the whole Island.  We'll check that out. What about the blood?
That's great.
We think he could be a suspect in a murder investigation.
It's important.
Anything else?
I was thinking the same thing.  He must be local.  It's logical for him to assume that the police would be there, but he recognized Andy's voice and called him by name.  What about this?
Call dispatch.  Double the patrols.  I want that area blanketed.
What did he mean by Huxley?
He moves around a lot.  Why?
We're going to work on the message.
Ten days ago.
I got it from the tournament directory.
We've already met.  Haven't we... Doctor.
We think he might be making a reference to drugs?  Miss Emma is a street term used by junkies for Morphine.
But he had to dump the body there to make the move.
He uses castles...plural --  then says "can't move me."  Singular.  Not can't move us.
I signed the confession.  What about the car?
On a variation, yes -- but it must be a variation that is unique.
I've got be here for the police when they come.  Then I've got to practise. In case you forgot I'm in the middle of a match right now.
Hi, Sara.  This is Doctor Sheppard.  I was wondering if you could tell me if you have a book on chess called "Principals and Tactics" by Anton Berger.
What are they, please?
Yes.
It is.
This isn't a game.
How can you look at it so clinically?
Of course.
No.  But I'm open to distractions.
And you?
You've got to face the things you feel.
Call room service.
Can I come in?
I'm not looking for an apology, Peter.
I want someone I can get close to. I don't know if that's possible with you.
It's not that easy.
But I do.
Maybe you're afraid of what it says.
Last night was the worst. I dreamt you had one leg shorter than the other, and walked like a penguin.
You won't have to.
She was in a great fortress, first in the mountains, then in the jungle. How is that possible?
Then even if Lyssa tells us where she is, we'll never be able to reach her, for they will never allow the Fortress to rise near us.
Nor will I, till my bride is beside me.
Yes. They will be more help than high-born barons.
I'm not sure.
Lyssa, your bracelets. Bend them straight and cross them.
No! You cannot know that!
I found the body of the Seer in the stream.
You have done it?
Perhaps you think no man would return to me.
I ache with it.
I have need of friends.
Smart as well as quick. Now what do you have to give us?
Fame?  Thank you, no. Fame is the burial ground of contentment. Eat it and go hungry; count it and go broke; seek it and grow mad. Fame is what fools yearn for and wise men shun.
That I promise you.
Not sleepy, either?
Would you settle for a boar?
I am Quell.
A small house.
No.
I ...  ... am Titch.
Smart lad.  Bring me my spices!
I only want one.
Get me down from here you louts or I'll turn you all into pigs!
Surely a sorcerer of the sauce pan can make rabbit taste like venison.
I must take the old man to see some sick children. Kegan will guard you.
The forest is not safe these days. You'd best travel with us.
If that were so, you'd be dead now. He was aiming at the Dark One, for there is ancient hatred between them. Once his race had two eyes, like other men, until his forefathers bargained with the Dark Ones: they gave up one of their eyes in return for the power to see the future. But they were cheated, for the only future they were permitted to see was the time of their own death.
These walls do not lie! He will betray you.
He leads a group of Slayers, under the leopard banner.
With an old voice?
I will seek the Fortress for you.
There's an Emerald Circle a few leagues from here.  We'll find her.
That creature helps no one. And none who go there return.
Her name is Death.
Each to his fate. Wait for me at the inn. If I am not back by dawn, you will know my fate, and you must go on without me.
It's a hundred leagues from here.
Yes, they are weakening. It takes great power to maintain the Fortress, and they have expended much.
You said nothing. You told me nothing.
It is no trickery.
Tomorrow, the Fortress of Krull will rise with the sun in the Valley of Reeds. But the knowledge is of no use to you. No man has ever escaped the Web. And soon the creature will come for you, even here.
There is sand enough for only one life. Go now, save the other.
No?
...I don't know... It's true he touches me. I love him.
Pay attention to women, Leon.  They are dangerous, you know?
Well, I don't need them...
Good.
What if you can't approach the car or he changes car?
Oh really?  But can you miss the car?
Perfect.
I killed him... and cut him and ate all of him... I left nothing for you!
No.
No, you can't go out.
...This is what I don't like, you see: you don't refrain me, but at the same time I can't get out!
Mathilda, stop, please!
What?
Mathilda?!
What shall we do?
A little...
Huh, really? What? Come on, I'm waiting!
You've just to love me and I'll be the happiest woman around.
I don't grow up any more. I just get older.
...I don't know.
Then? You didn't give a shit about her father, didn't you?  You met anyway?
Nothing, for the moment.
It will take them five minutes!  How long ago did they arrive?
Excuse me, Mister... I'm looking for Mister Rubens' apartment, but it's dark out here and I got lost...
I have no fear.
...And how much is it?
Yeah, but I don't give a shit about.  I trade at left, at right and that's dangerous in there...
Giancarlo... Rinaldi.
...Even his mother wouldn't.
May we have this wolf's name and address?
Where?
Why am I such an authority?
I received my B.S. from the University of Pennsylvania, my P.H.D. from Bryn Mawr College.  I worked three years at the Boston University School of Medicine, during which time I had articles printed in the "Journal of Educational Psychology", "American Journal of Psychology", "Psychology Review" and "Science"... So I think it's safe to say my opinion is valid.
I'll make it.
What?
Are you and your friends planning on driving soon?
Pardon?
Routine, I assure you.  I just wanted to gage my health.  Am I healthy?
I'm going to ask you a question that may sound peculiar.
You have?
Okay.
No.  How far in one attempt -- what's the farthest someone like myself could walk?
The flowers... they're beautiful.
Why are you polishing it -- in bed -- in your pajamas -- at 11:15 at night?  Are you going to show it to someone?
Exactly.  No reason.  No occasion. It just makes you feel good to do something for it, to express your pride and affection for it some how...  How come you'd do that for a piece of metal and not for me?
You've just decided, is that right?
Don't bring it in here -- it probably has all kinds of diseases.
No it's not.  He should be here with me now, not trying to find some fucking bottle of Johnny Walker.  He's never been there for me.  I've always been alone.
About my love for her.
Not our problem.
I'm Isaac... I'm three.
You'll probably be bigger than your brothers.
This is the route approved by triple A.  Even if you followed back roads the entire way, you'd still be looking at roughly the same distance...
Mammoth.
Umm, Coalville Utah.
They called her 'Lizy' in the book...  Sorry I was late.  My jeep died on the way over from the paper.
California.
I always knew you had good instincts...  Goodbye Kris.  I'll see you when I get back.
Saluting.
No more words.  Until I touch the ocean with my hands... it's all just words.
Oh, that's not mine.
You should.  Children are a blessing from God.  I have four.
Confused.  I'm not sure what to do now.  I'm not sure what he wants for me.
Yes, I heard, and it's not a problem.
...Noooo.
Water?
Maybe you shouldn't stand in the road like that. You're pretty drunk.
No -- S.E.R.A.
Right, I'll get your door. I tend to fade in and out lately.
You what?
Maybe another drink first. More tequila?
To death?
How long's it gonna take, for you to drink yourself to death?
I like hearing you talk.  If you feel up to a short walk, there's a place to eat around the corner. All the food in Vegas is terrible so the place doesn't really matter. How does that sound to you?
Well, then I guess this is our first date... or our last. Until now, I wasn't sure it was either.
What are you thinking? Are you angry with me?
I do. I really do.  OK. I have to do some shopping alone. You go out for a few drinks and then pick up your things. Don't hurry and I'll be back before you to let you in.
Why don't you go in and sit down. I have some gifts for you.
Sorry.
I know that...
Whatever that means. Open your presents.
I threw them into the garbage, which was perhaps immoral, but I wanted to come to you clean, so to speak. I thought we could go shopping and pick up a pair of jeans and forty- five pairs of underwear and just throw them out each day.
When?
That's amazing. What are you? Some sort of angel visiting me from one of my drunk fantasies? How can you be so good?
Last spring I happened to walk past a house that I had once patronized. There was a cool breeze blowing off the ocean and through the window I could see a bare leg. The girl must have been taking a break between customers. It was a strange moment for me because it reminded me of my mother and despite the fact that I was late for something already I just stayed there, loving the atmosphere of it and my memory and... the reason I'm telling you this epilogue is that I felt that I'd come full circle.
Fifth and Mayflower. You know it?
Yes, that would be great. Are you her for the convention?
I am lonely, Yuri.
Where have you been staying?
Yes, of course. How much do you need?
It's me, Yuri.
I once had to judge a Theta Chi Tighty- Whitey contest. Trust me -- I can handle anything.
Insurance? A love affair? Pure unadulterated hatred? Believe me, the DA will come up with plenty of reasons.
He's an ass that's gonna try.
You took my class in LA. You had the best high kick I've ever seen. Are you one of my lawyers?
I'm a fraud! But it's not like normal people can have this ass! If my fans knew, I'd lose everything. I've already lost my husband. I rather be in jail then lose my reputation!
Did she have a weapon in her hand?
Was there any reason for you to believe she had discarded a weapon?
Not that I saw. But like I said, I went straight upstairs to take a shower.
No. I was in the shower.
Yes. I was washing my hair.
I got up, went to Starbucks, went to the gym, got a perm, and came home.
Due to the fact that you retained the residence, Ms. Bonafante is entitled to full ownership of the canine property in question and we will be enforcing said ownership immediately.
Tell him, Paulette.
Is everything okay?
Yes, I am.
But you agreed last night. In the office? When we were discussing my "career"?
Donovan's firm is defending a major murder case and his caseload is so heavy he's taking on first year interns.
What?
-- uh --
Aristotle.
I don't know.
Well, what am I supposed to do? He's engaged! She's got the family six- carat on her bony, unpolished finger.
No.
Look at him. He's still scratching his head.
What's the point of staying? All people see when they look at me is blonde hair and big boobs. No one's ever going to take me seriously. The people at law school don't, Warner doesn't -- I don't even think my parents take me seriously. They wanted me to grow up and become a Victoria's Secret model who marries a rock star. Now, for the first time, it seemed like someone expected me to do something better with my life than wear underwear for a living. But I was kidding myself -- Donovan didn't see me as a lawyer. He saw me as a piece of ass just like everyone else. It turns out, I am a joke.
Although Mr. Huntington makes an excellent point, I have to wonder if the defendant kept a thorough record of each sperm emission made throughout his life?
You're kidding!
Your scrunchie?
Power yoga?
I wasn't gonna --
My money's on the angry daughter or the ex-wife.
How do you figure?
No, she can't move for an hour.
You're going to trust the word of a woman who named her child after a condiment? She's ly-ing.
Blondes are discriminated against worldwide! Brooke's a blonde, and people are saying she's sleeping with the cheesy pool boy and shooting her husband. If she was a mousy brunette, it would be, "Oh, the poor widow."
If she were a true blonde, she would've left the cheating bastard. Blondes don't let their husbands get fellated by brunettes and live to tell about it.
Exactly how much gorilla sex do you think a sixty-year-old man can take?
Well, hurry up so you can come home! We miss you!
Oh, my God! I completely forgot to tell you!
We're on our way to the bridal show in New York so we thought we'd rescue you from law school for the night.
Where's Warner?
Why not?
I changed my mind. I'd pick the dangerous one.
She could make you drop three pounds in one class. She's completely gifted!
Of course, I do!
So are you!
My family expects a lot from me. And I expect a lot from me. I plan on running for office some day.
Do anything exciting?
Tell me about it. I can't imagine doing all this and Donovan's internship next year.
I gave her my word, Warner.
See?
A restaurant in Oakland. Where no one would recognize us.
I'm covered in very expensive Egyptian mud -- hardly naked.
Well, that's what we're trying to prove didn't happen. Do you have any reason to believe it did?
Cunnilingus?
Yeah, luckily.
Precisely.  Faith has persuaded them a pygmie with a sling can kill an armed giant.
Nay.  This is a private affair, no audience welcome... Better you watch the dismantling of our enemies... and, look you, see the moat is set aflame.
This is another victory, my friends. What began with the lash shall be concluded with a caress.
You are cruel!  Your heartless jesting worse than torture!  How can you speak of love when you see what I am!
You lie!  You wish to humiliate me, as if the form I'm forced to bear were not punishment enough!
Not from me, surely...
I prefer to think, more like the sagacious owl.
Too bad your precious Jack can't hear you... the damsel in distress... A rescue attempt would be most amusing... We could flay sweet Jack alive as an after-dinner entertainment...
It's nothing.  My men take great delight in routing the enemy.  Don't trouble yourself, beauty.
From the parapets most likely.  The men are amused by a battlefield entertainment of my own contriving.
Later, beloved... Now I wish only to be with you...
Oh, no, never... nothing like that... never crossed my mind.
Well, er... no.  I mean, you don't look like dragons I've heard of.
Cathay?
Oh no... Don't you understand?
Or was it the time you and Jimmy Squarefoot stole the golden apples I'd forged.
Who might these friends be?
What!
Twas the Princess Lili gave me the answer... have you seen her, by chance?
Well... I... I don't want to be rude, but... it's generally known that --
Big question that, lad.  Why what?
Aye.  Honeythorn Gump'd be a powerful wizard indeed could he answer.
Then, what's gone wrong?  Why did it happen?
There must be an answer somewhere.
How is it this hag knows the truth?
Aye.  That foul wallow be where Jenny Greenteeth dwells.  Oona... lure her out.  Play the part of a girl-child.
Now, Jack-lad, no one's asking ye to skewer the worm.  Even St. Michael'd have a job on his hands for all that.  But the serpent hoards a pile of booty, Achilles' armor among his treasures... if we find our way within the mound and him asleep...
Careful, lad.
The colt's still too small.
Sounds like the bird we want.  All right lads, follow yon raven!
Beyond Devil's Needle, all is unknown.
Nay.  That's but to distract the casual visitor.  A dwarf is too busy to suffer fools gladly.
Stoutly spoke, lad.  These dwarves be sore grouches... Pay no heed to their spiteful grumbling.
We'll surely be in our graves if we don't.
Long as we don't lose heart, Jack...
Faerie magic's no match for a sorcerer's power... We have Ogg's gifts, the key and the --
Sunlight, you say?
I admire your valor, Jack.  By all means, seek him out... But first, we needs visit the kitchen.
Don't get too far!
Sapphire!
He'll not escape me.
I've not heard a note out of you.
Were the Princess Lili to join me I would sing till my lungs burst!
Tis not the wound, that's sure.  Not a scar remains... we're talking about a spell; harder to repair than sword-work.
That's it then... the ring!
You'll do it because I am you liege and I command you to do it!
Sport, indeed.
Stop complaining.
Shhh!
They rival the angels of paradise.
I'm not your judge... nor have I any desire to witness the trial.
I didn't know... I didn't...  It was so lovely... he was in my lap like... like a baby... and... I...
My own father...
It happened so fast.  He was hurt and ran away.
If I were your bride, would the kissing ever stop...?  Do you wish to marry me, Jack?
Then, perchance you'll me.
No... it's not you he's afraid of, it's... light...
Whilst you were sleeping, I fetched your ring.
Grand champion, is it?  And what great cause leads you to me?
A unicorn's been slain.  The last stallion in all the country.
You'll need the fastest steed alive, for Couer de Noir's castle rests at the very edge of the earth.  Only the sharpest sword and the golden armor of Achilles will protect you from his fury.
Follow the raven in her flight, Follow old black wing to the edge of night...
Far as you're concerned she's dead, believe it or not.
I pray God grants it me.
No fear of that now.
Do I not please you, Jack?
And am I not fair?
Be fair, Oona.
Heading north still?
His honor, I suppose... seeing he no longer can defend it.
It's done... we'll never catch him.
You've been inside?
What are you doing?
I thought I might stop by.
We can work.
Home after.  Will you come in and say "hi"?
I love red!  That's my favorite color!
Here, honey!
I couldn't sleep last night.
Has he eaten anything at all?
Who are all these people?
What did you think it would be?
What are you doing here?
Really?
I don't even...what do you mean?  I don't even know what that means.
Hand me a towel.  Hand me a towel.
What are you talking about?
You're off, you know?  You're way, way off.
It would help me if I could kiss you.
We've known each other since grade school.
And if I enclosed it?
If that's what it takes.
Months.
I did tell you, didn't I?  That I'd be ready to start the Berlin model today?
From the day I started...to today.  Can't stand it.
You were the only neighbor I could tolerate.
I know what the deal is.  Josh is a pimp. I'm not stupid.
Why would you be there?
You'll know me by the time we're through.
I'll hate you forever.
I almost saw Catalina.
Why?
I'm gonna take a walk.  I need some money.
I might have a solution.
My dad used to play a game.  I never really understood what it was until after he was gone.
Getting high, I guess.
I haven't used anything for two days. I'm trying.
Don't be.  And hide whatever that new drug is you have.  I like it.
I wanted you here so we could have a few months together.  Maybe everything happens for a reason.  Something bad to force something good.
Here.
I'd build a house.
I can die trying.
I haven't been touched in years.
We just weren't very much alike, I guess. I don't know.  I liked your dad more than I liked you.
Left you this place.
Thanks for telling me.
I want you to find someone for me.
She's a little sad, is all.
He doesn't answer.
You're the most beautiful woman I have ever known in my life.
You didn't think someone from your office would call and tell me you wrecked the entire building and threatened people with a baseball bat?!
Money?
Look, I wasn't serious about you taking Sam, so you don't have to get into any actual construction to get out of it.
He doesn't want to spend the weekends with you anymore.
Sounding?  I need help.  He's cheap labor.
At least we'll have a house to show for it.
Let's go.
What?
Sam's favorite.
That wasn't a dream.  That was Sam.
I kind of said that maybe they could do something.  Help.  I'm sorry.  They really wanted to come.  I really wanted to come and they wanted to be with me.  I don't think they'll be too much trouble.
I'll say a lot of things I've never said before.  It's habit.
I can't pick you up.
So could I.
Not a perfect day.
She wouldn't even fucking go out with until she was sixteen.  I mean, that's not even a rule, just her own thing.  She like figures things out on her own and then that's it.
Who?
Everything happens for a reason.  That's what my dad said.
Lois will stay with them.  Or we can pawn them off on your parents.
I know.
I never asked for more.
Sam took them to a movie.
It's not ours.  It's George's.
Why?
I don't know what I'm doing.
Why?
I just thought it would be nice.
It's a boy! Well, let's get a look at him.
Crawford's are always looking for new talent.
There are ways around that. Right sergeant?
Kid's getting out. I got him a pardon.
I did, Claude. I mentioned you. I mentioned you both. But the fact is, pardons don't come cheap. The kid can hit. What can you do?
Then what's the problem?
Oh, she's fine. She's just not coming today.
But I'm not on the outside. I'm in here.
Claude. Here's to your new job down at the bank. I always knew you'd make something of yourself.
Of course I did. He said he'd file an appeal right away. You didn't tell me he was so good looking.
He seemed like a pretty good lawyer to me. His offices take up an entire floor of that big, new building on 125th Street, and he was using all these words I never heard before. He even offered me a job.
Claude Banks.
You went to Monroe?
You gave up baseball to be a bank teller? I can't latch on to that.
A loan officer?
You need collateral.
That thing? Who'd you steal it from?
Oooh...
What'd you say?
There are people down there having fun. I want to be one of them. I want you to be one of them. On Monday you can be a bank teller if you want, but tonight you're a bootlegger with a truck full of Puerto Rican rum and a fistful of cash.
That was mighty charitable of you, Claude. Looks like we both got fucked tonight.
The fork is the least of your worries, Claude.
What about you, Radio?
What do you want, Claude?
My daddy always said when a man starts talking about the weather keep you hand on your wallet.
You know what, Claude? This whole time we've been down here, you've done nothing but think about yourself, acting like this whole thing is my fault. That plan with your cousin, did that include me?
At least you're honest for once. So now you want to be my friend? Well, let me tell you something, Claude-my- shit-don't-stink-Banks. You got a lot to learn about friendship.
I'm stuck!
He'd be doing me a favor. I'm getting outta here one way or the other! Goddamn rats and shit! Fuck!
Say what?
I don't know. Who do you want?
They must be the right people. Whoa, there goes the hot dog man. Let's get a couple. Damn, that smells good. Nothing like a ballpark hot dog, huh?
I'm sick of watching Camp 12 win the championship. Every year they get to roast the victory pig and we get dick. This year I want that pig.
Him?
Make 'em throw strikes.
I ain't getting in no airplane with you. I'm finally wrapping my mind around the concept. They threw us in this shithole for life. Don't you get it, Ray? We're gonna die here! Might as well head up to the cemetery, pick a plot and start digging.
Maybe you're fooling yourself, Ray. Maybe you're just a chip off the old block.
That was five years ago.
We're not talking, you're talking, and doing too damn much of it, if you ask me.
He's just a lonely old man. He likes to talk.
Forget about that. You run if you want to, but you're not taking this car.
He knows nobody wants to hear the truth.
'Course I was right. About what?
I try to moisturize regularly.
Well, not yet. It's still in the planning stages.
You heard the boss! Let's move!
You heard what the man said! Move it!
Just because it's in my mind, Goldmouth, don't mean it ain't real. Everything worth anything starts with a dream.
Come on, old-timer, hook the brothers up.
What happened to 'em after that, Willie?
I think that old man lost his marbles about a hundred years ago. Come on, let's get this over with.
I was already here a good many years when they came in in 1932.
He must still be in there.
I'm going in for him. He'd do the same for me.
I believe in treating the convicts with respect, if that's what you mean.
If somebody deserves respect, Mr. Pike, they receive it from me, convict or no convict.
What difference does it make? Natchez was better off without Winston Hancock! Who cares if a couple of no- account bootleggers went to jail for his killing? At least the state of Mississippi got 40 years of cheap labor out of the deal!
Sure don't. Mind if I ask where you got it?
Goddamn it, Wilkins, would you please just shoot the nigger!
They're called subways. A nickel will take you from one end of Manhattan to the other. Helluva ride, too.
Satchmo.
You should have come by last night, Radio. You woulda had yourself some fun.
Me? Willie Long.
That's Natchez-under-the-Hill.
Understood.
If I was you, I'd want somebody who can handle himself in a tight spot.
Hey, that's Dad's throne! How did Adrian get that? Is Dad okay?
Adrian, I'm asking you nicely, in the name of all that is good: release my friends and get in the flask.
No. It's the inner light. And with it we can defeat anything you've got.
You mother...
I was going to let you out, eventually, Cassius. I swear.
Don't do it!
Maybe try the opposite of that.
My brothers told me my mother was a mountain goat. Which would explain my chronic halitosis.
No.
That turn you on there, RuPaul?
I just need to find my brothers and be on my way, Beefy.
I also have this odd pain in my mid section. Kind of a hollow feeling...
Look, it's okay for me to shit the street. But you gotta use a toilet.
Nobody's as evil as my brothers. Those dudes put the wick in wicked.
Look. You were really high. Things happen.
Oh, and don't forget, you're shoving a pineapple up Hitler's ass at four o'clock.
Cassius, didn't I tell you to stay out of your brother's mind?
Don't worry about coming up with anything. It's cool.
So go get 'em, Dad!
Son, just do your best.
Could you maybe not tell anyone about this?
Beast.
That's nice, Grandpa. Why don't you just enjoy the fishing?
Your father wants to see you and your brothers in the throne room.
You're the spawn of Satan. You got it in you.
I got hit by a big light that was attached to a lot of metal.
By she, do you mean he?
Mr. Sleepyhead must have some major ties to the dark side.
Little nervous. Wanna puke.
That way.
Oh, that's terrible, Reege...
You followed him?
I'll just go to Heaven.
No thanks. I'm looking for a girl named Valerie who also smells like coconuts.
Andrew.
I'm sorry. I just assumed. Your accent maybe. Where are you from?
My dad's an optometrist.
If you want to.
"Octopus people?"
It's not that cold. Here, let me wrap it.
I have an apartment. I don't remember exactly where. My dog knows, though.
Thanks much. You know what's nice about you, Valerie?
Why would you be floating?
That wasn't me. I was being possessed by my brother, Adrian. He's the one who call you a gross pig.
From my dad's side of the family.
Eight-hundred, split down the middle. Tuesdays and Thursdays I rehearse with my scene partner so the living room will be off limits.
It's like eighty degrees in this hallway. You from the South?
No, I'm just calling you... a guy who has my flask.
No, for you! How old are you, Billy?
Nude. Imagine, a pair.
Wait for the wind! Wait and hear the birds sing over you!
Your own work?
I don't care... Just get it over with.
Has anyone ever broken in to where the babies are?
I never even visited Nursery before tonight.  When you wonder, it slows you up -- you know?
I'm in my party mood.
Did you ever see anybody renew?
Did you?
Here.
I never go upstairs. You're a nice old lady.
K.
But I wasn't sure you'd come.
You know.
You know something.
Both... running's what I'm interested in.
Speak to your friends for me, Jessica... please...
That's tomorrow.
Maybe you'll think of something...
That's nice.
Maybe they're angry because they're grown in meccano-breeders.
But what is this -- why?
Muscle? I don't know that one.
Then -- why don't you leave me -- go to them -- explain
You knew that I wasn't before, didn't you?  Why did you stay with me?
I doubt it.
Do you think he was telling the Truth?
Thirty thousand years didn't last very long, did they?
"Beloved Husband". "Beloved Wife". What can all that mean?
You want there to be one... that doesn't...
No, there doesn't. Not really -- just so many want it to exist... so many who don't want to die... want it so much that a place called Sanctuary becomes "real". But it doesn't exist. It never existed. Just the hope.
To what?
I don't know.
At least it's over...
Oh, my...
Dead... they're dead... and buried.
What a pity. I was hoping you'd be here to bury me.
More... many more.
I promise. We'll go on as soon as it's light.
I don't think so.
Yes, I thought my wife...
It kept going off for some reason. False alarms.
I forgot. Anyway, I hate the idea of acting paranoid.
And smooth... Almost no movement - back and forth, I mean.
Right... This just glided along.
Anybody else have a key to the house.
As best we can.
Or something.
Yeah... Laurent.
I don't know.
Over there.
I think he suspects something... We have to be careful... I miss you.
Are you positive he knows?
He makes films for Mr. Eddy.
It was a long time ago... I met someone at this place called Moke's... we became friends. He told me about a job...
Yeah. Call him.
What about tonight?... Whatiya gonna do about Mr. Eddy tonight?
Yes.
Alice, I...
We killed him.
Up the stairs - down the hall.
You really don't remember the other night, do you?
Sit down.
I gotta headache... What's goin' on?
Out in back.
He... He can't talk. it appears as if he can't talk, anyway.
I've got men searching the building and the grounds now.
Nothing, Marsh. Vanished. There's an APB out on him. His photo's been faxed nationwide.
Nothin'.
Who was the man?
He won't give his name.
A headache?
Tenor... Tenor saxophone. Do you...
I don't think so. Where was it that you think we've met?
That's absurd.
Called? When?
I guess so.
What?
What job?
It'll be ready.
We just killed a couple of people...
Guess we're goin' over to the "Ten Pin".
Sorry... I...
Nothin'... You want to go for a drive?
Thank you.
It's always been a source of deep regret, but the mountains surrounding us have made reception almost impossible.
This is the only thing I was able to save when those heathens surrounded me.
You see, from this vertebrae I shall be able to reconstruct the entire skeleton.
Well, it's a good morning, anyway.
Why, of course. Yes.
It certainly is.
Please don't call me Lovey.
I'm thinking.
Just call me Barney.
Okay, Lovey.
I'll say.
Not for me, thanks. No, I'm too weary.
Please! Please! Do not wait for me! I eat so very little.
It's unbelievable.
Sure - sure. Don't you worry. I'll take care of you.
When are you going to start?
Well - I'm
Oh, no - you don't want to go yet, honey.  She'll stick around too.  Is that right?
He must have had a heart attack, or perhaps the fumes. When the plane landed he was dead.
I'm glad you like it. It's made right here in the valley.
Who, for instance?
Shall we go inside? I should so like to show you some of our rare treasures.
We follow many.
That's intelligent.
Centuries.
Our Valley is very rich in a metal called gold, which fortunately for us is valued very highly in the outside world. So we merely . . .
Yes, yes. They were very sincere about it too. You see, a perfect body in perfect health is the rule here. They've never known anything different. So what was true for them they thought would naturally be true for anyone else living here.
Why, Mr. Conway, you surprise me!
The only one.
Why not? She's an attractive young woman.
No, I mean about her appearance. If she should leave the valley - what would happen?
I can't let him go alone. It's suicide!
I've offered you some warm broth. I thought perhaps-
Splendid!
I thought the porters had instructions from the High Lama not to take anyone.
Aren't you afraid to leave? You don't want to look like an old woman, do you?
Are you the High Lama?
Yes.
You?
Do try to sleep, Bob.
It's not knowing that's so awful, Bob. Not knowing where you're going, or why, or what's waiting when you get there.
It looks like it.  Smell those fumes?
That's where we were this morning. He had it marked. Right on the border of Tibet. Here's where civilization ends. We must be a thousand miles beyond it - just a blank on the map.
It means we're in unexplored country - country nobody ever reached.
You're a strange bird. No wonder Gainsford calls you the man who always wanted to see what was on the other side of the hill.
What could there be except just another hill? In any event, I'm not curious. At the moment, it seems to me we should be concerned about getting home. I'd give anything to be in London right now.
That's what you said.
What's on your mind, Bob? You talk as though we're going to have trouble getting out of here.
There must be some connection between the plane and this place. They must have deliberately brought us here. Why, Bob? What reason could they have for doing a thing like that?
I'm afraid the porters are just a myth.  I guess we never will know why we're here, or how long we're going to be held prisoners.
George. George - do you mind? I'm sorry, but I can't talk about it tonight.
Then you'd better go, George. This is no place for you.
Oh, George . . .
George, you couldn't possibly stay here, could you?
Oh yes. It's all set. Maria made the arrangements.
You're wrong, George.
I've already asked them. They're afraid to make the trip. We'll have to send an expedition back after them.
What was that?
I'm Alexander P. Lovett, sir.
What if he refuses?
Brilliant!  Can anyone here fly a plane?
Oh, you're going to make life very simple.
On the contrary, you're not strange. And that in itself is confusing. I have the same idea about Shangri- La. The sense that I've been here before, that I belong here.
Then it wouldn't be a garden spot for long.
Struggling, why?
I'd love it!
The first thing we want to do is to cable the Foreign Office. All of England is waiting to hear about my brother. There's a cruiser at Shanghai ready to take him back.
Please don't go.
I'm sorry.  I haven't even got any cigarettes left!
Perhaps.
All right, I'll be there.
I guess I lost:
They don't.  Now, son.  If you get the job, you're going to be working with some very particular people who like to do things in some very particular ways.  Here's a little piece of advice:    Don't use this so much.
His physics are a little different than ours.  Don't worry
No. But You'll get used to it.    Welcome to the Men in Black.
All the time, sir.
I'd go with number three.
Don't worry about it.  It's been a long night.  Speaking of which-- you owe me a cup of coffee, remember?
Dee, you've been useful for 50 years.  We're clueless, you're tired. Why don't you go home and get some rest.
Sir--
Why?  What are you gonna do?
I understand.  Hey, it works for the Hasids, right?  No one recognizes them.
This is a college?  I'm sorry, I thought it was a carnival.
Keep her out of here while I check it out.
She didn't even know you. .
Such a shame, too.  Cause you made such a good impression the first time.
Just so I understand... you're "thing" is... acting like an idiot?  Or is it actually being an idiot?  Besides--
There's gotta be a hundred pawn shops in downtown Philadelphia.  I take it there's a reason we're going to this one.
That's the Loch Ness Monster.  And... Kay-- that's... 444-Eyes?
Well... if you think about it, then it would mean that maybe everything he's saying is true.
I know you don't trust him.  You don't trust anybody--
Getting eaten!? That was your plan!?
Or what's no horrible down here that everyone's trying to avoid It?
You know, there's something we never really thought of...
Do have any idea what I just said?
Why not?
Out of focus?
Most entirely.  Earth has been overrun with an infestation of a species which, in order for the planet to survive, must be exterminated.
But, unfortunately, you're even less attracted to guys you've never seen before.
Dee?  What are you doing here?
What do we have?  Are we showing anything?
Where's he making his big speech?
I got a planet check on that bug.  It's from way the hell out in the third belt. it's organic, formed in the same blast that made our solar system.
Don't tell me.  Insects.
Well, uh... so we can got into things, I guess.
If I may, sir... what exactly are you offering?
Is it now?
They're inside.
Can you see the balloon man?
Forget that guy --
He'll turn around.
I can't leave.  You said so yourself, there is no Minority Report.  I don't have an alternative future.
She's still alive?
Found?  Where?
Anne Lively...
I know... I do, too...
Right.  I know --
They were performance pieces.
And put them out.  Some not as quickly as others, but let's change the subject, shall we?  The future is much more interesting than the past.  Don't you think?
No, you're not in trouble.  I'm interested in a murder.
On account of those are not his eyes.  He had 'em swapped out to fool the scanners.
Just tell me about the intended victim.  This Anne Lively...
Hang on, Lamar --
I understand.  What's the other thing?
What?
We won't let them.
Stop.  Just wait.  Who's the victim?
Then come to my house.  We'll talk --
We're years from that.  John, I'm asking you: please, come in, we'll shut down the system until we get this thing figured out.
Everybody runs.
I just wanted to congratulate you. You did it.  You've created a world without murder.  So what if you had to kill someone to do it.
Armor up -- sick-sticks and concussion guns -- this is gonna be close.
Get him some coffee and tell him to wait outside.
Start a location run and a contact search for future victim Leo Crow.  And, Jad, I'll need a Last Known Sheet when you get it.
Sure, Chief.  I think I'll grab one for myself while I'm at it...
Maybe you didn't hear me.
What does he think of your chosen line of work?
It could have been a nightmare... Sometimes they dream about the old murders.
I guess that's all of it.
Are you kidding?  There's absolutely positively no way, on my best day, I could ever beat twelve seconds!
All right, I'll try...
No.  He got tired of pretending.
I know that.  I know you would have done anything to find me.  I know you would have died for me.
Crow.  I'm not gonna kill you.
I'm asking you again, who made you do this?
If I tell you, my family gets nothing.
I'm... not... a... killer.
I'm not.  I was trying to heal them, not turn them into... something else.
You think the three in the tank come from a test tube?  They're merely the ones who survived.
Actually, I think you'll have to run out, but yes, that's what you have to do.
He's dead, Lara.
Sean --
Anne Lively... But I never said she drowned.
I padded your expense account for the last six months.
Wait, just a second...
I wanna kill my boss.
Nice to meet you.  Gum?
That's the Red Ball Alarm.
I don't know, why?
They could have been put away. Anderton could have found them.
I was a Treasury Agent for eight years.  Why?
Cause all of a sudden you got no one you can fucking brown nose anymore.
Sure.  Raincheck.
I know who you are.
Thank you.  He hasn't tried to contact you?
Have you been there recently?
It wasn't a suicide attempt.  I regret ever saying that.
The FBI found something that belonged to my son.  A sandal... Anyway, John was upset. He... he...
He shot a hole in the damn ceiling. So what?  You lose your son, let's see how well you handle it.
I left him because every time I looked at him, I saw my son.  Every time I got close to him, I smelled my little boy.  That's why I left him.  And now you can leave.
Shhh!  They're sleeping.
You don't understand... they're a hive mind.  It takes all three for their predictive abilities to work.
Just give me the key. I'm gonna stay here.
So?
What if I gave you forty?
Nightlife. Where's the hot ass?
Manhattan.
We're in Fashion.
I don't know. Do whatever you want.
No more.
Where were you?
If they asked for her, they're probably expecting blowjobs all around.
They're not too classy to have tits rubbed in their face.
Fine. You want to help Ricky, talk to Maxie yourself.
Yeah? You sure?
Ho's a good guy --
Look at the bills. I can't. I'm not gonna put my daughter through what I went through.
Yeah, well Max offers a lot of things. And I got news for you. He's not the sweet old man you think he is.
Tell you the truth, I don't give a shit for me. But that little girl is so special, and you're gonna fuck her up.
What'd you say?
Draw.
She'll be out in a minute.
It's bad. Before you even showed up, he said you were Maxie's 'token goons', and not to be trusted. He wanted to TCB alone. I was gonna ride shotgun to keep the English dude above board. Now he's spooked. This shit's snowballing.
Was gonna be tomorrow morning. Now, who knows?
This Welsh dude is tripping on Ruiz cause he's a Shot Caller.
What do you mean 'troughed?'
And not a word to Maxie. He'll shit if he knew we crossed a bridge.
Quick drop. In and out.
He was uptown when I paged him. I gave him the address. He's meeting us there.
Me? No. Not really.
Why?
Yeah.
What about Ricky? He'd jump at the opportunity.
You told him you liked him.
You're ready to move up. Christ, the way you busted up the place, you're doing worse already. May as well get paid instead of punished.
What is it?
What drill?
Tom, the Welsh dude --
Where's the drop?
Traveling light. I like that.
Well, this is the corner.
Don't know much. I hear he runs a tight ship.
Ruiz isn't here.
It's not losing record.
I'll page you.
What happened to boxing? I thought we made a vow.
You wanna go right now?
Some Mexican? How much could he weigh? A buck fifty, tops? I'd kick his fucking ass.
Shhh... Hello, room service?
Relax. You got one-fifty. You heard the guy.
I told you what they said.
Nothing.
You know he fucks all his girls, don't you?
I detected no vibe other than that Ruiz thinks you're a fucking idiot.
So we're working?
You got that right.
Do not put this on Ruiz's tab. Start a new one.
Dude, get back out there. You gotta help me get them in the hot tub.  Hang on girls! Just get out there. I'll be right out. You know how I do.
We're getting whacked.
You want us strapped, don't you?
You're out of money?
This is horseshit. It coulda been so easy.
How we gonna sleep? We only got a few hours til dinner.
I don't want to take any more chances.
I'm just warning you, I can't swim.
Cool. See you later.
Yeah, uh, what's the movie?
Where do you live?
Jimmy knows. 13th Street. We'll meet you there.
What? Why am I bad?
You really in trouble?
Like you were doing any better shucking and jiving like you were waiting for wings outside the Quick and Split.
Well, he ain't gonna be around no more.
I hear the China Club is a laugh.
How's it going?
No, thanks, man. We got to head out.
I handle most of Cardiff Giant's stuff.
Not usually. Mostly Trustafarians.
Yeah, bring us four fernet.
Tell me.
Because you lost my fucking carpet cleaning van and I don't like you.
Some fuckin guineas he sent me. It's midnight and the motherfucker's ordering an apertif.
Maxie told you to keep your mouth shut while you're working, right?
Outfit? What's he talking about?
Shut it, man. Shut it. Tom is a square. He don't but dabble in shit. Maxie had me hook up a loan-back with him, through an Austrian passbook account.
Mmmm-hmm. Where's the, uh, 'Dragon's lair?' Where do you live?
Well, word on the street is you're Welsh.
Bet you like that shit.
No, my mama. She's from Grenada.
Yes, sir.
What you talking?
You din't have no 1, 2, 8.
I ain't drinking hot piss with you. Come on, Sam.
There's two guns on you.
Now.
No, man, I'm doing okay. Thanks.
Yeah.
Cause I don't want to walk around with my head all nappy, looking like --
Man, I don't want to hear all that.
That's what Mama used to say.
No. That's the name of the slave- master who owned your family. You don't even know who you are. You're nothing. Less than nothing. A zero. Who are you?
Then the devil is white.
I will not touch the white man's poison: his drugs, his liquor, his carrion, his women.
For evil to bend its knee, admit its guilt, implore His forgiveness, is the hardest thing on earth --
-- the hardest and the greatest.
Tell Him that.
I'm sure we can. This is a new sister, Sister Betty.
Not exactly, but I want to be one, like you.
Brother Benjamin, do not rush, it has to be exact.
She ate.
So it is not a matter of the breeding conditions or preparation of the meat. The meat itself is foul.
I'm sorry. I've had you on your feet for hours.
How old are you, Betty?
I'm not made of glass.
We've never had a fight. Not a real one. But we're going to have one right now if you don't talk about it.
I was going to talk to Bembry about it tonight.
What do you want me to do? Our people need me.
Betty it's me. It's me.
Malcolm, where are you? We've been calling all over the city.
Since when do you start telling Sister Betty my business? Since when? She has nothing to do with this. You tell me, not her, not anybody else.
What did I tell you about assuming?
The way I feel, I ought not to go out there today. In fact, I'm going to ease some of this tension by telling the black man not to fight himself -- that's all a part of the white man's big maneuver, to keep us fighting amongst ourselves, against each other. I'm not fighting anyone, that's not what we're here for.
You've been talking about the disciples. What color were they?
I told you we don't know for certain.
Please, go ahead.
For the white man to ask the black man if he hates him is just like the rapist asking the raped, or the wolf asking the sheep, "Do you hate me!" The white man is in no moral position to accuse anyone of hate.
You put it very well.
What?
The sentences to run concurrently.
Now you come back.
What for? I ain't white and I don't put out.
All of your children are delinquent, Mrs. Little, and one, at least, Malcolm is a thief.
What mission?
What does Sidney say?
C'mere.
You better believe it.
What's your story, baby?
Well, bitch you move too slow.
Make it too easy and it ain't no fun.
The hell you are.
I ain't doing bad.
You heard the Sergeant. Outside.
He's bright.
Believe it or not, you're safe here. The Judicial police will kill you. If they can.  This page?
Am I a suspect?
It's not worth it. Be with them instead.
I'll call you tomorrow.
How do I contact you? We still don't have the ATM info.
[Si.]
[Daniel what?]
[So you're married to him? And this looks remarkably like his brother.]
[The what?]
[We don't know! We never see his face! We have to wait in the other room. He was screaming to the girl that...]
[The ransom money. At the drop. He said Tazinari, one of the policemen had taken it. He was crazy.]
[Not for a long time, sister.]
[Who are you?]
I don't know, but I know his face.
[You stole the drop.]
[His lawyer. Jordan Kalfus.]
Listen it was a calculated risk. I've done it a million times and never got caught.
Oh, like you haven't been in worse places.
You're crazy. People would hire a has-been, Ray? A drunk?
You can drive and talk at the same time, can't you?
Let me guess, you wouldn't stop talking?
I go to school, don't I?
Maybe. Did you hear him?
It's not too bad. Will it take a long time before it's better? Our big swim meet is in three weeks. Interschools. I was going to swim in the one hundred meter freestyle.
But the Emperor of China had 1000 of them! How can that be?
It must be difficult having lots of wives.
I know you're not.
Still not a question.
I'm going to keep people safe someday. Just like you.
I could do it. Remember the day you wanted the pencil? I know why. And I saw that car again. I wrote the license number in my notebook. Except I missed the last number.
It is serious, Mrs. Ramos.
The traffic takes some getting used to.
If something happened, my reaction would be to fight to protect her. I have skills in that respect. Pinta would benefit by the fact that... I'm a soldier.
Planned what?
I want you to get into your car now and meet me on the south end of the footbridge between Reforma and the freeway junction. In 45 minutes.
Los Arcos. Was a little girl kidnapped recently? About twelve maybe?
Yeah? And if she was ugly?
[The money, 10 million U.S. will be divided into two 15 gallon black canvas bags each containing five million which will be checked at the bank by the K&R agent. Then driven to the house in an armored car where it will be transferred to the delivery car.]
Hmm?
I already ate.
Two tourists who never went home.
That's what friends do.
I can take care of myself.
And they took that away.
All right, I'm having a fair time. It's just that I get one Saturday night off in three weeks, and I wanted to wind up with something tonight.
Listen. You people go grab a table. I'll be back inna minute. I'll be right back.
Oh, yeah.
I didn't like her, Angie. I don't feel like calling her up.
I don't know. What do you feel like doing?
I don't know. What do you feel like doing?
There was one nice-looking one there inna black dress and beads, but she's dancing now.
I looked for you, Angie, before I cut out, but I couldn't find you.
What for?
Angie, by the time I get Clara home, it's gonna be one, one-thirty. By the time I get home, it's gonna be two o'clock. I gotta get up for ten o'clock mass tomorrow.
I was gonna call that girl from last night. Take her to a movie tonight.
It's her baby too, you know.
You told me.
I keep one eye open when I sleep, because she's gonna come in, stab me in my bed.
Catherine, don't make an opera outta this. The three-a you anna baby live in three skinny rooms. You are an old goat, and she has an Italian temper. She is a good girl, but you drive her crazy. Catherine, you are no fool. You know this is no good, an old woman living with a husband and wife. Two women inna same kitchen, anna house burns down.
Oh, Catherine, please! Don't make a tragedy. You come to my house where you know you be happier yourself.
I know it pains.
They're the worst. College girls are one step from the streets. They smoke like men inna saloon. My son Joseph, his wife, you know, she types onna typewriter. One step from the streets, I tell you. Mrs. Pilletti ponders this philosophy for a moment.
This is something recent with me, this bursting into tears at the least thing.
I'm thirty-four.
Yes, I know.
Why don't you just move out to Portchester?
I'm afraid of being lonely.
Yes, I know.
Please...
I'd like that very much.
I'll wait for your call.
Sure.
I'll see you around.
That means he'd have to marry the girl when she was one year old.
Sure. Thanks a lot about my mother. We'll work out some arrangement, because naturally I want to pay...
Waddaya talking about, do you know what you're talking about?
Marty, see that my mother is nice and comfortable, eh?
I'm coming home right now, Ma. I'll be home in about two minutes. Tell Thomas stick around, I wanna see him about something.
Thomas. He told me it was a very nice place.
Marty...
She didn't look Italian to me.
You don't like her. You only met her for two minutes.
Well, let's not get inna fight about it, Ma.
Waddaya read there, Joe?
Hey, Marty, come over here a minute.
Hello, Thomas.
Hey, why don't you go to the movie? Your mother and me, we're gonna be baby-sitter.
Hello, Thomas, how do you feel?
I just can't stand it any more! Every minute of the day! Do this! Do that! I don't have ten minutes privacy with my husband! We can't even have a fight! We don't have no privacy! Everybody's miserable in our house!
Tommy, I promised the babysitter six o'clock.
All right, Ginnie. I don't wanna talk anymore about it.  I don't think I got one hour's sleep the whole night.  Last night was the first time in my life I ever heard my mother cry, you know that?
I told her she could use the kitchen any time she wanted...
Don't you know the first thing you're supposed to do at a new post is present yourself to the commanding officer with your orders?
You're welcome to one of these, whatever they are.
I have been in this Army a long time. I know just what you guys are up to. But there are limits...
That's right.
I don't know what else. You've been that route a little, haven't you?
No, Ho-Jon, we're not going to open you up.
You make a mean martini, kid.
Well, southern boy, I suppose you want the sack that's convenient to the door.
The chest-cutter.
Way we hear it, the Pride is supposed to have run up the highest lifetime batting average ever recorded in Wayne County.
A native is someone who is born in a particular place.
We got to start rehabilitating, Duke, if we want to be halfway human by the time we get back to our wives.
It's that disrespect for you, that's what I can't forgive them.
And I'm grateful for you, Frank, especially with those boors around. We've grown very close in a short time.
Come clean with us, Frank. Were you on this religious kick back home, or did you start to crack up here on the post?
Shut up or I'll tear you apart.
N-n-no thanks, G-General.
What?
I'm impressed, Pierce. Naturally, the kind of job I have, I don't get much chance to keep up with what goes on in the OR.
We had a team at the 325th Evac last fall. I coached the boys myself.
Oh, I'm not sailing with you. I work out of the hospital here.
'Course it isn't, but how many chances do we get to go to Japan? With our golf clubs.
Your high school friend who went around saying 'Me lay, you lay?' to all the young females in the community. As I remember, you said it was quite a successful approach.
And if it isn't, why don't we call Washington on your telephone? You tell your story, we'll tell ours.
Yeah, and he's lost a lot of blood. I'm afraid it's hit more that just the lung.
I'm glad you feel that way, Major, because you see it's a team effort... doctors, nurses, enlisted men... and I feel responsible for my whole team, and I want you to know I'm satisfied with them.
Okay, Major, honey.  I'm going to have a couple shots scotch and go to bed. I'd normally ask you to join me but obviously you're a female version of the routine Regular Army clown. And that turns me off, so just leave my outfit alone and we'll get along fine.  See you around the campus.
No, let's stick to that strategy till we see whether you boys can do two things. The first is get that halfback out of the game. He had one year with the Rams before the Army got him, but he didn't play too often because he's one of those hot dogs.
For a start. I just have a hunch... well, it isn't entirely a hunch...
You have a certain modest charm yourself.
Something else we have in common.
Of course not.
That's when the real strain starts. Three weeks on a troopship.  Poor baby.
Excuse me, Sergeant.
What do you want with those two medical officers?
Every time we feed him, it either comes right back up or he coughs and turns blue and has a hell of a time.
Let's get his clothes off quick.
What did you have to test, for God's sake... the dental Don Juan of Detroit?
You've been drawn to other males? Since you were a kid?
You don't have any problem. You've got thirty good years ahead of you, easy. Maybe you'll have to cut down as you grow older, get along with just two fiancees, but...
You can cut the bow.
Right, Ho-Jon. See you later.
Major Burns will be out of your tent in twenty-four hours.  Tell them Captain Pierce and Captain Forrest are on their way.
I'll tell you my news. I'm retiring from football.
Stop that, O'Rielly!
They can't do that to me!
What's that, Henry?
Colonel Merrill is a veteran of twenty- five years in the Regular Army, a soldier first and a doctor second. A member of several patriotic organizations, he believes it's America's God-given mission to maintain a foothold for freedom on the Asian mainland.
Are you all right?
Can't. I'm feeling too good.
You got me.
Why can't you call right, you bone- headed, pig-eared, lop-eared, pot- bellied
Hello.
I guess so. Then what happened?
I don't know. About three hundred thousand.
Oh, I'm sure I can.
And, Miss MitchellI think from now on you'd better work directly with me.
Well, don't say anything at all. Just sit down.
All set, Ann?
No, no, no. This man's going to jump off a roof.
Here. Wait a minute. Let me comb your hair. Sit down. There. That's better.
You remember those lovely people your father used to take care of? I thought I'd buy them some groceries. Oh, Ann, dear, it's a shame, those poor
Darling, there are so many complaining political speeches. People are tired of hearing nothing but doom and despair on the radio. If you're going to have him say anything, why don't you let him say something simple and real, something with hope in it? If your father were alive, he'd know what to say.
Look, Mr. Connell . . . I just can't afford to be without work right now, not even for a day. I've got a mother and two kid sisters to . . .
It isn't the money. We're after circulation. What we need is fireworks. People who can hit with sledge hammersstart arguments.
There is no letter.
There is no letter. I made it up.
Oh, the Chronicle would consider it dirt cheap.
Oh.
We'll clean him up and put him in a hotel roomunder bodyguards. We'll make a mystery out of him.  Did you speak to Mr. Norton?
Take it easy, John Doe.
Trying to improve the world by jumping off buildings. You couldn't improve the world if the building jumped on you!
He's watching the other door.
Did you find her?
Take charge of him. Get him a suite at the Imperial and hire some bodyguards.
Oh, quiet, quiet, quiet.  Say, tell me something did you read that speech you're gonna make tonight?
The heelots!
There you are, Boss, just like you ordered. Symbols of the little people.
It must be some kind of a gag.
No, sir. That spot under the bridge where we slept last night's good enough for me.
The elevators are still runnin'.
John Doe Club?
Oh, you trust him, eh? Well, that's fine. I suppose he trusts you, too?
Okay, Bone-Setter Brown goes. Here, sign it. Meanwhile, here's fifty dollars for spending money. That's fine. Beany!
That's right. You got it! Sure! He came in here and I made him change his mind. "Bulletin editor saves John Doe's life." Why, it's perfect. I'll have Ned write it up.  Oh, Ned!
I'm terribly sorry she isn't here.
Well, I was just thinking about this John Doe business. Why, as soon as it comes out it's all a fake, you'll be washed up in baseball, won't you?
And another thing, what about all the kids in the country, the kids that idolize ball players? What are they gonna think about you?  Close shot: Of the COLONEL. He has dropped his gloveflopped into a chairand has taken out his ocarina.
Feller runs the Chronicle .  Here's the speech you makeand it's all written out for you.
Okay.
He's never offed anybody. His rap doesn't show any violence.
We don't know how much time we have. If I can get in to talk to him -- maybe we won't lose anyone.
Deal.
It's not me. It's her. She's going out with this baseball player -- Greg Barnett.
It was Warriors plus 6 this morning.
It's Lieutenant Sam Baffert from the San Francisco Police Department.
Yeah... Yeah... Now I can hear it.
I'm sorry, Mike. I never heard of LaMarra flipping on anyone before. He said he had the cops paid off. Antonucci never flipped on anyone before. He had the cops paid off.
What happened, Mike.
Are you going to turn on me too? Who helped you when you were strung out? Who gave you money? Who bailed you out of jail?
You can't help me, man.
Whoa!... The government. They control everybody's mind. You're too fucking stupid to know that?
They want Walter dead!
I need to get something straight first.
Johnny Hawkins. Bail Bonds. I gotta be over at county in fifteen minutes, alright?
Well he's a little fucking agitated -- he ripped the phone out.
Solis said to keep you clear of this.
We ran a search on relatives. He has a cousin in town -- Clarence Teal. Smalltime thief. Last known address was on Pine Street. He moved out a month ago. We've got a couple leads on him to check out.
Being faxed over now.
Like it had to be done.
I've rarely shot anyone.
A little exercise in lateral thinking. The obvious solution isn't always the only solution... See you tomorrow.
You living together?
She grow up in Livingtston, too?
Do you really?
What? Bring somebody in so he can cut his nuts off?
It's against my nature.
I do.
Now she's going out with Greg Barnett?
Still needs work.
That's okay. That's his style.
He'll be running at the quarter pole.
We lost.
Occasionally you lose.
Bullshit! Would it have happened to you?
Only that floor.
Doing what? Cleaning toilets?
You heard.
Yeah that's it.
It's okay. We broke up.
Just now.
For the last week things have been going pretty well between us. I think we've been doing a good job getting intimate and all that stuff...
And you think he'll...
Hmm?
I mean I said this trip should be a 'roadtest'.
I'm talking about... What are you talking about?
Prude.
He says, "Thank you very much."  I'll discuss it with him right now... Good-bye, Chief.
Depends. What's up?
Define concern.
Your concern is heartwarming.
What kind of appreciation are we talking about?
Hey, you just got a five thousand dollar raise. Get a car of your own.
Impound isn't a rent-a-car company.
What happened to your Trans Am?
Halden, how nice to hear your voice.
To live forever.
-- Because there'll be no remorse. Not in my world.
If you could meet God, what would you say to him?
-- No.
No, not me, I've been lucky.  But I've seen what happens to other people --
Someone who believes in miracles.
Guests?
Nothing, go back to sleep.
In here I am.
What about the customers with reservations?
New York.
Go!
Christoph had spinal cancer.  His body kept rejecting gene therapy. He was desperate.  It was him, it wasn't us --
What?
That's right.
Listen to yourself.  Digitization.  You know that officially that's a pure fantasy --
Try harder.
Then where is she?
Cleaning up a mess.
-- Katie.
I know.
Of course you do.  And the only shot you've got of keeping your ass from sinking in a sea of shit is to tell me where you got this program.
Because you'll never believe me.
Just like that?
Activated.
-- Waiter.
Speed?
Wait a second...  What time is it?
... Perhaps there is a way... I have heard tales of another power.
They're called squirbs.
Ah... sure.
I'll be at the Observatory Sunday.
I've never been this sore in my life.
Use extreme caution, Rangers. You are dealing with an evil here that is beyond ALL comprehension.
Hey, NOBODY enters the Command Center without a power coin!
... I just pray we're not too late.
Don't lose hope yet, Alpha!
I think so.
I am the crane, agile and sublime!
NINJA WOLF ZORD!
Ditto for the Swooping Swallow.
If we told you -- we'd have to kill you.
BULK!!
BUT I'M YOUR COUSIN!
Ah, the old and doddering.  I'm going to SCOURGE their puny minds, reducing them to ZOMBIE'S. And then I'll put them to work rebuilding my empire.
So they've been destroyed?
Activating Power Scope!
LET'S DO IT!?
I ain't no fuckin' kike!
You've got the public upset, Al.
Maybe. But he'd still be the Boss.
Got the same problem with my pop -- garlic. Nothin' you can do.
I guess I am. Just a little.
What's that divided four ways?
Which is why he doesn't need us.
You got men on Profaci's place?
Ya ignorant Guinea, it's kreplach.
What are ya thinkin', Charlie?
I must be going.
I'm already late.
I needed to see you again.
London?
I'm very sorry... I didn't...
You must be feeling better, if you're looking for sex again.
We'll make 'em, and we'll enforce 'em. All of us. Together. We all get one vote. Includin' me.
So what is the problem?
Good. 'Cause every time you start thinkin', we end up makin' money.
And if we don't invite Maranzano, we can't invite Masseria. Guys don't wanna be choosin' sides.
Might as well put the time to use.
I told you twenty!
Who?
Yeah. Yeah. I bet ya feed Maranzano that same line.
You tryin' ta tell me something? I don't come to a meet with a weapon unless it's with an enemy.
So he can talk to all the families behind your back? Maybe have his own meet at 3:00 AM under the goddamn boardwalk? No. You're too smart for a sucker play.
I know about you.
Didn't know you felt that way.
You gotta plan these things.
I'll take care of the Boss.
The guy doin' the job names the price. If you don't like it, you can kill Masseria yourself.
You disrespect our tradition.
Okay. I'm listening.
That's just what I'm sick of. Everybody lookin' ta knock somebody off! Greedy for what you got. A bunch of fuckin' hogs at the trough.
I'm comin' for my twenty thousand.
That a Jew compliment?
Switch hands.
I'm serious. It was bicameral disjunction - right brain and left brain out of balance. He was a rightie, so I made him switch the pencil to his left hand. Just to see what'd come out.
Animals? What <u>kind</u> of animals?
Olive. - Where exactly am I?
I didn't say anything.
Oh, sure. Now you're gonna tell me it was all <u>his</u> idea. You were completely innocent -
<u>Why</u>??
I'm a simple man. I'm just doing my job. I <u>enjoy</u> my job. Why does everyone want to make it difficult for me? Stealing tickets, switching bodies...it is <u>so</u> <u>irresponsible</u>.
Back in your head, where he belongs. <i></i> No offense, Stu, but on your own you're kinda vanilla. I didn't want to send you back without him.
It's irregular, but...I just love that strip of yours. I figure I'll take the "Family Circus" guy instead.
Thank me next time you see me.
Got the ring. Got the airline tickets. Soon as they break that piata, we'll grab a cab - and it's off to the land of palm trees and coconuts.
Why?
A piata. That's a <u>great</u> idea!
Sorry, Stu. It's all part of the deal. We've got <u>big plans</u> for that body of yours!
Well, baby, I do, but to look at it from another angle...there's a <u>potload</u> of money here.
Not me. Nope. You must've been dreaming.
Yeah, I <u>could</u>, but the thing is, if later got here sooner, it would be...better.
I'd better go report this...
When'd you get in?
I'm fine, Kimmy. Fine.
Please, Julie. This is not easy for me. Our father took a <u>long</u> time to die. A long time. It just about killed us all. And Stu and I made a pact that when our time came - we wouldn't let it drag out.
Give me a date, Doctor.
Listen to me! Is there any way I can <u>warn</u> her what Monkeybone is up to??
You can't do this! You'll get in trouble!
Thanks, Kitty, I'll never forget you for th--
Sorry. The women here aren't my type. Most of them aren't even my <u>species</u>.
<i></i> I'm sorry, Kitty - what were you saying?
Sorry, Kitty! I'll be right back after I choke my monkey.
Like you'd know. You started out on the back of a napkin, you little...<u>doodle</u>.
I don't <u>know</u>.
IT'S NOT WORKING.
Oh, don't you worry. I'll be fine.
I'm just concerned about my daughter.
Well, once you're inside, it's nice.
Uh-huh?
No, I'm working too much, I don't have time.
My daughter lives right across the street from the Satan's Disciples' clubhouse, and I was so worried about her ... so, I went over and introduced myself. And they were the nicest people.
Mom ... I mean, it's amusing to imagine such a thing, but ... how many of those pills have you been taking?
No, no, it's my fault.  I've been pushing you too hard to do things on your own.
If it's about the bikers, dear, I don't want to talk about it.
Oh, I don't want to be in the way. You've got your career and everything.
Oh, it was such a big scandal.
I'm sorry, I'm a little nervous.  It's my first time in New York.  Just a minute.
So, you come here all by yourself?
Oh, yeah ... yeah ... it's a hellhole.
Those busts up there--all around the wall--who are they, sonny?
That--or he's out blazing trails. He'll show up.
That old standing offer from Diz Moore--Poet of Washington Correspondents.
Whadaya mean--*right*?
Yeah. What about the second act?
He isn't going to hurt enough as it is. *She* has to twist a knife in him, too--the regal jackass! "I'll turn my glamour on him," she says--
No. How'd you feel? Quick.
*I'm* just waiting for a street car--
I apologize.
Good idea. When?
I'll cherish ya.
Do we *have* to?
We're gonna get married.
Right now--everything I own--!
Take me home, Diz.
Well, then, that's great! And that's a great place to leave it! It's no use *my* barging into this now and--
He's a house-afire!
Kid--he thinks he's talking to that mob at home, but not a line we've written--not a word he's said from that floor has gotten into that home State.
This isn't a home, it's the crossroads of the world!
That settles it! I will not be attacked and belittled by my own children in my own home! My nerves are strained to the breaking point!
Yup--Sweeney, Flood, Farrell--waiting for you--
*You* tell Jim Taylor.
Happy, we've got the man. Horace Miller!
Oh--Jim!
Will you please tell me *exactly* what he's done?
Me! Jim--how--?
Well--that's not work, sir--that's fun.
The--head?
I said, sir--in my official capacity-- as an honorary gesture--I appoint you to the United States Senate!
Is *what* getting me down?
Oh, a *boy*!
Emma! Will you *please*--?
Is--uh--Jefferson Smith at home?
Why, of course.
Boy! My head's like a balloon--for two whole days. I never knew there was so much American history.
H'ya, Senator. I--I've sorta been looking for you--
Mr. President!
His last fight was his best, Jeff. He and his little four-page paper against that mining syndicate and all to defend the right of one small miner who stuck to his claim. You know, they tried everything, bribery, intimidation, then--well--
What's to stop you? Saunders will help you with it--
Good as new! It's quite all right--
I wish to ask the gentleman--has he one shred of evidence to add now to the defense he did not give--and *could* not give at that same hearing?
No, Jeff--please--!
Excuse me for interrupting, Governor, but--  --that plaster's gonna harden any second, son.
Now, now, now!  It's all right, Governor.
And Senator Paine too, Ma--we'd like to have him--
Yes--I think maybe you'd better.
You *couldn't*?
Right.
Oh, just a day--
Why?
I said--shall we get started *now* or--
Thanks very much.
No.
Since sixteen or so.
Have I?
I don't see where we are *with* it.
Look--I think we ought to skip it.
And a beautiful woman, too--don't you think?
Are you drunk?
Hurray!
Not *me*! Joseph Paine is the man they ought to be listening to! Come on!
Well--for a couple of years now--I-- I've thought it would be a wonderful thing to have a National Boys' Camp out in our State--
Goodnight, Senator--
You're not going to take your *suit* off!
You were about to recognize me, sir--
Mr. President--I stand guilty as *framed*! Because Section Forty is graft, and I was ready to say so. I was ready to tell you that one man in my state--Mister James Taylor-- was putting that dam through for his own profit!
How's that, buddy?
Oh--you're *sure* of that now?
Yes, *sir*.  Let's *go* Henry.
Well--I can *manage*--
That's what he's been doing since last heard from.
A Bill! Not *him*!
Fine thing Jim Taylor wished on me-- show him the monuments--I need this job like I need ten pounds.
Jeff--meet Mr. Cook and Mr. Griffith-- members of our State headquarters here.
Yes--a camp bill that will never get beyond a first reading. So calm down, Chick--and--goodnight.
Joe--I'm getting leery of this guy. We keep calling him dumb--and he keeps winding up in our hair! I'm telling you--when he finds out there's a dam going up where he wants his camp, he's gonna start asking questions six ways from Sunday--
Tomorrow! Joe--he'll hear the section on Willet Dam. He can't be there!
Listen--tomorrow I take him to see monuments--if I have to hit him over the head with a couple!
Joe--listen--all Susan has to do is turn those big eyes on him--he'll fall all over himself--just keep him out of there *one afternoon*--while they read that bill--
Shut up! You've *got* the man pilloried! Do you have to dance around him like a cannibal--!
Okay. See you here.
Yes. Good morning, Saunders.  Have you--uh--any idea how this happened?
No?
You're more than that. I've had example of the fact that wild horses couldn't pull confidential matter in these two offices out of you. That's why I tell you what I do--about Smith and this situation. So, you see--
Yes--
I thought I could, too.  *My* business--this fine future! I have no future I *care* about, if this boy is broken! I--I can't sleep. The only important thing in my life now is to save what I can for him. I want him to get a start again--I'll see that he's taken care of as long as he lives--!  Saunders--whether you ever mean anything to him or not--
It's too late now--it's *impossible*!
--in other words, Jim--with this Willet Creek Dam on the fire--the man who goes to the Senate now in Sam Foley's place can't ask any questions or talk out of turn. We must be absolutely sure of him.
I know, but is it worth the risk of a scandal now that a new man is going to the Senate?
Well, then appoint Miller--if you're sure he'll take orders.
Joe--do you mean to say--do you think you can actually *handle* this--this whatever-you-call-it in Washington?
Wait a minute--Jim--you didn't ask *Smith* over here!
I don't want any part of crucifying this boy.
Sure! The fight's in the open now-- to a finish--!
All right, we'll take Jeff with us--
Order!
Will Senator Smith yield to his colleague?
Who are you?
I got a trunk in that room. Will you get it out for me?
Sometimes twice.
Oh, yes - he's pixilated all right.
Thank you very much.
I haven't.
NO!!
Yes, but I
It isn't all! I'd like to explain
Your Honor, what she is saying has no bearing on the case. I object.
What's that got to do with it?
Yes!!!
Oh, did I? I'm sorry . . .
Really?
Well, I'd like to - but I have a job to think of.
It's wonderful.
You can almost spit on it, can't you?
Probably as small as Mandrake Falls.
He sounds like a person worth while knowing.
Are you? When?
No, I don't mind.
Mabel, that guy's either the dumbest, the stupidest, the most imbecilic idiot in the world - or he's the grandest thing alive. I can't make him out.
What else can I do? Keeping this up is no good. He's bound to find out sometime.  At least I can save him that .
It took some high-powered acting, believe me.
Last night he proposed to me.
Yeah. Funny twist, isn't it?
Babe ought to get him drunk again.
Shhh!
They are? I forgot all about them.  What do you think they want?
Yes, sir.
Perfect! Perfect!
They say if it hadn't been for Deeds, they'd have gotten all the money.
Suppose you just answer, Miss Jane. Now, will you tell the Court what everybody at home thinks of Longfellow Deeds?
Mr. Cedar!
I'll tell those mugs to keep their shirts on, that you'll be right down.
Mandrake Falls.  M-A-N
Besides wanting to be my lawyer, you also want to handle my investments too?
No, thanks.
No, thanks.
Oh, sure. Sure. We don't want to fire Arthur.
Oh, I don't want to keep them waiting any longer. They're important people.  I wish you'd go along with me, Cobb. They're all strangers to me.
Oh, they insisted on following me.
Listen. Listen, Longfellow. You've got brains, kid. You'll get along swell if you'll only curb your homicidal instincts - and keep your trap shut. Don't talk to anybody! These newshounds are out gunning for you.
That's my job. I'll take care of that. I'll keep that stuff out of the papers - if you'll help me. But I can't do anything if you go around talking to people. Will you promise me to be careful from now on?
A farmer, eh! You're a moocher, that's what you are! I wouldn't believe you or anybody else on a stack of bibles! You're a moocher like all the rest of them around here, so get out of here!
What kind of wife did you say she was?
If she was his wife, she should have all the money. That's only fair. I don't want a penny of it.
Huh?
No use in getting tough. That'll get you nowhere, Mr. Deeds.  You know, we've got letters.
You mean to tell me you don't carry a pocketful around with you?
Well, I don't know where to begin. There's been so many things said about me that I
Not at all.
Oh yes, I was getting to that, Your Honor.
No.  Yes. There's just one more thing I'd like to get off my chest before I finish.
Thank you, Your Honor.
Of course they're going to stay.  She's got some fresh orange layer cake. You know, with the thick stuff on the top?  Sure, they don't want to go to the hotel.
Don't pay any attention to her.
South Dakota north.
Huh? Oh, yes - yes, of course. Her sister. Yes, I've been her sister for a long time.
Oh yes, I think it'd be a swell night to go for a walk. A nice long one.
Excuse me. What did you say?
Every man to his taste, sir.
Prairie? Oysters?
I'd venture to say, sir, you don't remember much of anything that happened last night, sir.
I did what!
Looking for?
Get out.  The evil finger's on you. Get out!
You try it.
Anything happened? I've got to get dressed! I can't meet her like this!
An hour? What's an hour! You know how time flies, Walter. My tie? Get it.
Good kids.
One hundred books?
You must have been concerned.
Doubtful. What did he say?
Mr. Cook.
Generally that doesn't work out so well. It sends the wrong message to people who need to make a change.
...And I from Phyllis.
No, Dr. Delbanco, it is I who am sorry. Sorry to have wasted your time with such...
Are we?
I think I've heard of him... a disciple of Rothberg, wasn't he?
You came because it's taking over. You're in its grip.
Now we're back on track.
What exactly is it supposed to do?
My name's Gilroy. I'm from the State Certification Board.
Do you want to come in?
Doc. Nice to meet you.
You've done well.
What do you think's wrong with her?
No, sir. I was empathizing. Sorry.
I'd better get in there.
It's okay. They pre-order. There's a choice of three entrees.
My patient had to leave early.
I think it's like... inquisitive.
Oh, so that's him? The Panda Man.
Doc.  Ainge...
...And?
It's a pleasure to meet you.
Okay.
-- Go on!
You're good.
Insane! Didn't ja hear? My family got five hundred times better.  Let's go, Vanessa.
There's something I think we need to talk about.
What do you mean?
Take a hike, Dr. Quack!
I'll come to you. We'll try a little walking.
No one ever thought so. You must bring it out.
We'll turn back anytime you want.
Is she against you getting help?
Something's bothering her.
No.
Sorry... I'm done.
Be specific.
Uh-huh.
Where?
Is that like a party trick?
Oh... this makes me sound irrational, which is probably right, but there was something about him saying this -- it was maybe the millionth time he'd told me about some preference of his. Well, I was so... tired of it.  Seems like my whole life someone's been telling me... I'm just not getting it right. Can we rest for a second?
Oh, there's something wrong with you, all right. Especially after hearing that dream of yours, about the Roto-Rooter.
It's pretty obvious to a trained professional.
In the capitol for Boy's Nation. Five days. Why?
Therapy? Hell no, I just don't want to do it alone.
Of course.
Which show was that?
Part of it. We were watching "ER" until someone called.
But...
What?
That's not quite what I said --
What do you want me to see?
What happened today?
Was it something that happened at school?
First off, he tells me to stop smoking cigarettes. I told him abso-fuckin'- lutely no. As you can see --
No again?
Really?
How are you?
I understand.
This is exactly what I wanted.
Good-looking woman.
Did you know that Danny Ainge was drafted by the Blue Jays? Do you know what kind of athlete you have to be to play in the NBA and in the bigs?
-- Skip. Knowing what you do about me --
Okay... let's say that, for now.
Sexual surrogate... slash... companion.
No, Doc, not a doll. I am Panda. I'm talking about much, much more than a doll. The world has never seen what I'm talking about... except maybe in the movies.
Doesn't matter. You can call me Doc.
Everybody has a story, Skip.
What it felt like was... a series of separate, unconnected lives -- hillbilly kid, wrecked college boy, garbage man, civil service guy...  ...et cetera... et cetera. Every time I'd leave a life, it felt good. Whatever problems I was having were suddenly gone. I had no friends and I didn't talk to my family. The only constant, stabilizing force in my life was... drugs.
Didn't need one. We didn't even need a warrant for most of the shit we did. Man, the IRS... we could go in your bank account, your credit cards... hell, we used to go into doctors' files and get all the juicy details. Nobody wants to argue with the IRS.
Harder than I thought. Took me three tries. But I was highly motivated -- figured there was no point in leaving me and taking that along. After two bomb-outs, I found a place in the desert...
"Mumford"... I mean, why pick the name of the town you were going to?
No... no training.
I'm honored.
You're completely reliable.
Yes, yes it does...
What?
Sounds familiar.
I've had worse.
All I remember is him turning into a blast of sand,... and then I remember nothing.
Perhaps.
It is because it was you who read from the Book. He has chosen you to be the human sacrifice needed to regenerate the body of Anck-su-namun.
-- then perhaps, the golden Book Of The Living can return them to the underworld.
And burn the map and retrieve the key.
You will not believe it.
For them to protect it like this, you just know there's got to be treasure down there.
Yeah, get me a glass of bourbon, a shot of bourbon and a bourbon chaser.
I am an English woman.
I just decked your brother
You swear?
Really want to know?
Twenty-five percent, and not one single farthing more.
The only thing that scares me, Mister O'Connell, are your manners.
Yes, I'm hoping to find a certain artifact, a book, actually, my brother thinks there's treasure. What do you think is out there?
We're about to be shown the way.
Who was talking about what?
I know, you're wondering, what's a place like me doing in a girl like this?
Jealous? You kiddin' me? Did you see that guy's face?
Yes, I know, and I'd like to keep them.
Drunkard? Fool? Rat-bastard? Please call me something original.
My dear, sweet, baby sister, I'll have you know, that at this moment my career is on a high note.
Picked his pocket, actually.
After all, you rode us night and day to win that bet.
Still...
Don't blame me, I don't even remember being there.
Read the inscription on the cover!
What's it look like!?
Yes,... I see.
We coulda had 'em for free, all we had to do was give 'em your sister.
No kiddin', without a key, it'll take us a month to crack this thing,
What are you going to do? Shoot him?
The guy! The Priest! THE MUMMY!
And now he's going to use it to bring his girlfriend back
Of course.
Really?
Except for one little thing.
Head hunting.
Really?
Atta, boy!
The Inscrutable Six?
I can't.
I thought you'd never ask.
What did he mean?
Thanks.
Think positive.
You know, Mr. F, me and the boys always loved workin' for you. You had such style: the clothes, the dancin', the elegant way you'd snuff a babe. You were the King...
And I'm gonna nip it in the bud.
Captain who?
You're nuts.
They hurt... BUT THEY DON'T STOP ME!
Just a waitress.
I thought you'd chickened out on me.
Me.
I saw him walk you home.
Roy.
Alone tonight?
Date?
I wouldn't mind being famous.
Nothing wrong with being a waitress.
It's home.
Monica, where are you?
I used to believe that. Now I'm not so sure.
He's got the fact that he's Superman!
With what?
There's a vague similarity.
I lost another fork tonight. She's getting suspicious, I know it.
So you're chicken?
Are you serious? This is the break we've been waiting for!
Archenemies! Casanova isn't just a criminal -- he's a supervillain. Stopping him could be our ticket to fame, fortune -- and babes!
Yes.
Usually a superpower is a magical endowment or a great skill. In his case, it's entirely emotional.
Mother... it's not what you think!
Because... I'M A SUPERHERO!
But... the silverware?
And Mister Furious... His anger is his power.
Who are they?
This looks like a job for Superman --
It's suicide.
Through there!
Proceed.
You know, General Kutusov, there is a very strong possibility that the fire was not started by Napoleon's troops but was organized under the orders of Rostopchin's secret police.
If I can presume to go into the Emperor's mind, I believe that he has based his entire campaign strategy on obtaining a peace treaty after the fall of Moscow.  When Vienna fell, there was a peace treaty.  When Berlin fell, another treaty.  That has always been the rules of the game.  But what is he to do now if no treaty is forth- coming?  He knows that beyond Moscow, there is nothing, and that, if he withdraws, there remains only a fall into emptiness.
I, personally, am convinced that he will withdraw his army from Moscow, and attempt to establish himself in Poland for the winter.  In the end, he will not allow himself to be cut off from Paris.  But I believe that if he is offered any encouragement, by Your Majesty, he will postpone this decision as long as possible. He is a gambler and he will trust to his luck.
Yes, with all due respect, I do Citizen Barras.
No, thank you.
Where are they?
The numbers are not particularly relevant.  You are not up against soldiers -- this is a mob, and they will run as soon as things become sufficiently unpleasant.
Who sent my wife and son out of Paris?
And where is Joseph?
What cowardice!  What treason! Joseph has ruined everything.  How could they all lose their heads. They knew I was coming up fast. Victory was just within grasp. Come, come, turn your troops around, General Belliard.
Bertrand, sire.
Yes, sir, I had the honor of meeting them on the trip from Paris.
Yes, sir.
I haven't been back for ten years. Is your family still there?
It is the work of incendiaries.
But this is not a matter which can be settled tonight, surely?
You have made such excellent use of it; I should think you will hate to leave it.
Would you like some brandy?
Ah, well, that is the first rule of warfare.  You must wear long-sleeved and long-legged underwear.  You can never conjure up brilliancies with a cold bottom.
Good evening, Mademoiselle.
Yes, it is.  It must be one of the worst nights we have had this winter.
Are you staying with a friend, sir?
Would you like to take me there, so that we can get warm, sir?
Lisette La Croix.
No...
You would tell me, Joseph, wouldn't you?
And you, Junot?
You must not act impetuously.
Well, you shall see.
I have no idea.  Her maid said she left two days ago, to meet me -- I can imagine where she is.  But when she finally does come home, she will find her things in the street and my door locked.
No, I'm afraid I never had the pleasure of meeting the General. This sword was taken several days ago from your son by some of my soldiers.
I thought I was.  I was confused.
Yes.
One had better legs.
Yes.  They were the easiest.  I made love to one of them within ten minutes of our first meeting.
Not in the least.  After all, what is adultery -- only a brief transaction on a couch, requiring a few minutes of privacy.
I will never forgive you.
All right -- I promise.
Open the door.  It's me.
Will you be joining us, soon?
Not be safe?  What on earth are you talking about?
It's me.
Oh, my darling.  I'm sorry, too.  I won't do that again -- whatever you do.  I won't cause you any more embarrassment, I promise.
I gave it to Berthier... this afternoon.
What are you talking about?
Yes, I wrote it.
I couldn't face telling you.
About Hippolyte Charles.
No, Major, I merely wish to state that your vehicle appears to be somewhat slower and heavier than mine, and point out that, if you would be kind enough to pull over to one side of the road, I could pass you and be on my way.
Yes, I do -- very much.
Of course, my dear -- how cruel to have been separated from her.  And how strange it must be for you to be here, away from your family and everything you know.
Oh, my dearest child -- you must not worry about anything.  I will teach you everything that you must know.
No.
I did not ask her to go to war against me.
I very seriously doubt it.  I don't think there is any possibility of making peace with England so long as she sees herself safe from invasion. That is why we must increase the pressure on her economy.  With Russia in the Continental Blockade, England must collapse.  More than 40% of her trade is with the Continent and Russia.
We have a treaty with Austria.
My dear Talleyrand, none of the Kings of Europe bear any friendship for France.  It is easy for you to talk of reliable treaties.  The only treaties you have been able to negotiate are the ones I have won on the battlefield.
What you are talking about is a gamble on moderation -- when I gamble, I prefer to gamble on force.
Alexander and I are friends.  We have reached an understanding.
He will stand by his agreement -- I know him better than you do.
Monsieur Varlac, I will count slowly to five, and if you have not begun to get down from the cart by then, I will carry out your execution, on the spot.
That's it?
Why you say that?
Passed out?  Can't hang, huh?  Boy, I knew you was a lightweight.  Passed out on one funky ass blunt.  They don't make 'em like they used to, baby.
I don't know... I think he went out the back.
Ain't the rest room this way?  I gotta pee.
What happen?
That's cron-don, sir.  My mom hates for me to smoke, so she made me bud-brownies. Wanna bite?
Come on, Day, try it.  For moms.
I said shut up!  Now who sent you?
You.  Hi, Uncle Willie.
I know, we had a good time.  But ever since you guys moved out here, it seems like we've lost touch.
Thanks for reminding me.
Lay down, Day-Day.  Stop moving.
Man, it's a long story.  I met D'Wana three months ago.  She had a little pudge in her stomach but I didn't pay it no attention.  Come to find out, she six months pregnant.  Saying I'm the daddy!
That ain't the worst part.  Her little sister, Baby D.  She's the one that gets real physical.  But I got a restraining order on her, too.
Because, it's been a little tension between us ever since they got out the joint and ran their momma crazy.  And I'm just trying to keep the peace.  We moved out here to get away from that shit.
D'Wana brought Baby'D up here.
I know we cousins and all, but don't try an' hook me up with the big little sisters.
I don't.
I didn't see nothing.
I don't know, and it could be anything. But I just say we go take a look.
Yeah, I'm cool.  See you later.
Hold on.
Okay, buddy.  Don't send your entourage out here to do a 187 on me.  It's just a certified mail delivery.
Well bring yo' ass on...
I do.
Have you seen Day-Day?
Yeah, pops!
Well, then, it's all good.  Yo, Day-Day, something is going down with those Mexicans across the street?  I've been seeing a lot of activity.
It's a long story.  Right now we gotta do somethin'.
Negative...they vamped.
Butterflies, my ass.  I'm about to go home.
Go for it.
I don't know.
Bite his ear!
Thanks for the help.
Call me.
What?!  This look like a 7-11 or something?  Get the fuck outta here!
He moved out to Rancho Cucamonga with his cousin Day-Day.
Keep pushing.
Take your car.
Hell naw, Willie. Them fleas and tics must be sucking on yo' brain!
I don't know.  Suga, go ask Miss Ho Kym if she seen them.
I got my mase.
Mr. Nasty time.  But take it easy on me, girl.
What's he doing here?
What?
I really don't know. I don't live there. I was just visiting...a grave.
My security people are right next door.
That's...a comfort to hear.
That's right.
No.
And your husband works for somebody else.
I said I'd listen to you, not necessarily believe you. You're telling me my people are in a plot against me. You're telling me my husband wants me killed. What do you expect?
I would also like to apologize.
What?
You're from Santa Maria, Mr. Watson?
I'd like to know what...
Good.
Yes, I'm listening.
Of course you're invited. You're a big donor to the campaign. They love you.
Tell me why he's dead.
Do you now, Mr. Watson?
How do I know you won't kill my daughter once I'm gone?
No, please...
You've got to trust me. I'm putting my daughter's life in your hands. She's only six. She's just a little girl. Please, please, trust me.
I think you're right.
I can hear you good. Can you hear me?
I'm tired. I want to.go now.
All right.
No, kisses to...
I'm just an accountant.
What's that? You have to speak up.  I'm a little deaf in this ear. Between that and my wooden leg I'm a mess. Compliments of the United States Army Artillery Corps.
What are you supposed to do?
Thank you.
It'll come to you. See if you can stop this thing 'fore it gets started. Save us all considerable embarrassment.
I don't want my windshield cleaned.
It's already done. I've already done it. You have to pay me now.
You're going to deny me a lousy dollar after I've sweated like a pig giving you the gift of a clean windsheild?
No, I didn't. I confiscated it. There's a difference.
A surprise?
Help me get her off the rug.
Where?
I kill her anyway.
Yeah.
That's right, Preacher. I robbed that bank because I got tired of seein' children roamin' the woodlands without food, children roamin' the highways in this year of Depression; children sleepin' in old abandoned car bodies on junk-heaps; and I promised myself I'd never see the day when my youngins'd want.
Would you have free candy for the kids, Preacher?
I been mindin' Pearl.
When'll the skiff be ready?
How's your sister Pearl?
Don't!
Yes! Yes!
Yes! Yes! Hallelujah!
Yeah, and ornerier than the rest.
You don't hardly get settled till you're frettin' to git home again.
Mr. Powell!  Willa has run away!
I thought if you went and talked to him -- another man --
You and your gypsies! They been gone a week!
Bluebeard!
Icey, I don't want a husband.
Sshhh...
John, don't be mad! Don't be mad! I was just playing with it! I didn't tell no one!
Hush, Pearl. Come on.
Hurt her nothin'! Wash her's more like it!  Ruby!
It -- she --
Pearl's junk. Mom gets mad when she plays out here and don't clean up afterward.
Yes?
What's your name?
Tell me another secret about my Dad.
Why, sure. And there's fried chicken and candied sweets and cornsticks and apple cobbler!
No. No one never did.
It is my shame -- my crown of thorns. And I must wear it bravely.
Yes; from the first night.
I was praying.
No, Harry! I thought --
Harry, what --
How'do.
How you figgerin' to raise them two without a woman?
What's wrong, John?
None of your business, Madam.
Not this time! It was just one youngin -- a little boy babe. And do you know who he was, children?
What you been up to?
I sure as hell hope so.
Mysteries. Incredible body hookus pokus. Truth is we still don't know what they are or where they come from. As for nightmares...  Did you know that in the last three years twenty Filipino refugees in California died in the middle of nightmares? Not from heart attacks, either. They just died.
Then bring us back its tail and whiskers.
Because he was scary, that's why.
Hi.
You do?
If I can't, then you all can relax, because it'll just be a simple case of me being nuts.
You heard me. I grab him in the dream -- you see me struggling so you wake me up. We both come out, you cold cock the fucker, and we got him. Clever, huh?
What?
Just want to talk to him a second.
You don't know he did it.
It so happens I work here, and there's an unsolved murder. I don't like unsolved murders, especially ones my daughter's mixed up in -- what are you doing here at this hour? You're supposed to be getting some sleep.
Sure, but...
Uh, she just saw you, sir...
You're not falling asleep, are you? You could drown, you know.
No, Mother. Yes, Mother. No, Mother.
I threw that filthy thing away -- I don't know what you're trying to prove with it, but --
Nancy!
So he's alive?
Go on...
Right. Well, she didn't, exactly...
I dreamed about this guy in a dirty red and yellow sweater; I dream in color, y'know; he walked into the room I was in, right, right through the wall, like it was smoke or something, and just stared at me. Sort of... obscenely. Then he walked out through the wall on the other side. Like he'd just come to check me out...
Came to make up, no big deal. Your ma home?
No more fights.
Naturally, Comrade.
From Leon!... How is he?... Come, tell us... open it... tell us... how is he?
No, the opera starts an hour later tonight on account of the parade.
I see.
Thank you, Anna. I'll dry it up here when I wash it next. I should hate to see our country endangered by my underwear.
As beautiful as that? What else? Come, tell me.
You know I told you that Pavlov and I are going to get married when he comes back from the maneuvers. Would it be asking too much...
All right, let's uphold it for another ten minutes.
He's a bad man. Sends people to Siberia!
I can tell you exactly.
...des raisins de Madre, des framboises... 
We'll just say we had to take it on account of the safe. That's a perfect excuse. There was no other safe big enough.
Just see how happy the people look... from here....
No, that's bad management.
Monsieur.
With two f's, if you please.
You might get me an accurate map of Paris. I want to use my spare time to inspect the public utilities and make a study of all outstanding technical achievements in the city.
I must be stern with you.
We have opened a restaurant...
Well, gentlemen, how about my proposition?
Well, if your mother turns against you, you have to look for someone to adopt you.
Blue? Let's offset his mood. Find a striped one, and brighten it with a great blaze of tie.
Good evening, Monsieur.
Go to bed.
General, please... if you hear any rumors that I am a charitable person, will you please kill them at their source?
Good evening, Louis. You seem to be very crowded tonight. Can you manage a table near the floor?
If Lenin were alive he would say, "Buljanoff, Comrade, for once in your life you're in Paris. Don't be a fool. Go in there and ring three times."
These may have been the jewels of the Duchess Swana, but, like all private property, they were confiscated by the State.
Ninotchka, we are in the magic East, the country of Aladdin and His Lamp...
Oh, no, no. I am not a highwayman, I'm just a nuisance. All I'm trying to do is make things as difficult as possible.
Razinin.
I'll send you a muff.
A day.
A cow?
Look for yourselves.
Oh, yes, but have you a safe here big enough to hold this?
Leon, Leonitchka, she is not going to negotiate! She is going to fight that injunction. She's going to make a precedent of it!
We did it with the best intentions...
Sssh! Once and for all, we're in Moscow!
You believe in our cause?
So it's love which drags you to Moscow.
No visa.
Or a tunnel or a bridge...
Me?
Madame, it is that kind of approach which has made Paris what it is.
Nothing has occurred recently to shake my confidence.
Now I didn't say that either... naturally nothing would please me more.
Yes.
No, though the mere thought makes my mouth water.
Thank you. I've had all the calories necessary for today.
Not too big and not too small. What I'd call the typical room of an average man. Or shall we say a little above average. Now if there are any special aspects you wish to study I have nothing to conceal. Just look around. That's my desk. Those are my books, and here am I. Where shall we begin?
For mankind not a thing -- for womankind the record is not quite so bleak.
Thank you.
I'm at a loss, Ninotchka. You must forgive me if I appear a little old- fashioned. After all, I'm just a poor bourgeois.
The bayonet? Did you really?
Wounded? How?
Ninotchka, you can't walk out like this... I'm crazy about you, and I thought I'd made an impression on you. You liked the white of my eye.
Send me a plate of raw carrots and beets, beets predominating on a ratio of sixty-forty... What? There is a strike in the kitchen? Good! Will you assure the strikers of my hearty sympathy in their cause. I hope they will not weaken in their demands and tell them to put no dressing whatsoever on my vegetables... What? You won't serve me either? Now look here, Comrade, I think it is a fine idea to let the capitalists go without luncheon but when you keep food away from me you're weakening the people.
I don't like your following me.
At what?
No.
I don't think so.
Yes.
Yes.
Foolish? If this dress were to walk down the boulevard all by itself I would follow it from one end of Paris to the other, and when I caught up with it I would say, "Just a moment, you charming little dress, I want you to meet Ninotchka... you two were meant for each other." Ninotchka feels more comfortable.
For twelve francs, seventy-five.
Anything, Ninotchka.
Ninotchka, I love you.
A funny story?
No, darling. I'll tell you another story, a much better one.  The only thing that will be over on Thursday is the lawsuit. There will be no Thursday for us. Not next week or any week. We won't let it happen. I'll tear it out of the calendar. Is that a good story?
You must, darling.
Darling, darling... please!
I love you, my little Leonitchka!
All right, we'll make it red.
No! No!
No! No!
Who cried that one?
Yes, sweetheart. 
The one I got they wouldn't let me read.  It began, "Ninotchka, my darling," and ended, "Yours, Leon."
Now listen, Swana... I sold Monsieur Guizot the idea of publishing your memoirs in the Gazette Parisienne. "The Life and Loves of the Grand Duchess Swana of Russia"!
Now, Swana...
Well... er... I caught a glimpse of her when she walked through the lobby.
It's a dream of beauty. He never takes my word for anything, but I was right, wasn't I?
Months, Swana.
I'm going, Leon...  but before I leave I must compliment you on your gown, Madame Yakushova. Is that what they're wearing in Moscow this year?
No thanks, Swana.
Count d'Algout was for several years my personal representative and if it is necessary to sign any affidavit for him I'll be delighted.
Dear me... I must be losing my finesse. If I'm not careful I'll be understood by everybody.
What?
Of course not, my dear! I didn't come here with any such suspicion. How ridiculous!  Nor did I come here to pick up his hat.
If you were encouraged to come here by our meeting last night I am afraid you misunderstood my attitude.
People cannot be taken away, madame, neither a hundred and sixty million nor one. Not if you have their love. You hadn't. That's why you're not in Russia any longer, and that's why you came here this morning.
I must insist that you leave.
You were very careless with our precious jewels, my dear. They're too expensive a toy for two children to play with.
In other words moral ideas have no weight with you... all right, then let's deal with legal facts. You know that France has recognized the Soviet.
Under Soviet law the jewels belong to the State. France is going to uphold that ownership.
That's not the way to win him back... not Leon.
Yes.
May I ask why?
Where do you eat?
Where is that?
How do you do, my friend.
What is it, Rakonin? Did you lose your job?
Then tell Richardson to fire him.
He's nervous, sir.  He's heard you're looking for a new director.
That's Helms.  He's "sang froid," a world-class poker player.
Sirica's just trying to force one of them to testify.  But they're solid.
Jesus, everything is a crisis among the upper intellectual types, the softheads.  The average people don't think it's much of a crisis.  For Christ's sake, it's not Vietnam ... no one's dying here.  Isn't it ridiculous?
Good.  You know how I feel about loyalty.  I'm not going to let any of my people go to jail.  That I promise you.  The important thing is to keep this away from Haldeman and Ehrlichman. I'm trusting you to do that, John.  I have complete confidence in you.
I'm one of his people.  The Cubans are his people.  And we're going to jail for him.
Mitchell?
Uh, we've never done this before, sir ... How do we pay?  In ... hundreds?  Do you fill a black bag full of unmarked bills?
Is the war worth it?  Is it worth a one-term presidency?  Because I think right now that's what we're looking at.
He got pretty burned at Chappaquiddick.
And what am I supposed to do?  Just sit here and watch them coming closer? Eating their way to the center?  Lyndon bugged!  So did Kennedy!  FDR cut a deal with Lucky Luciano. Christ, even Ike had a mistress! What's so special about me?  What about Lyndon?  He could make a couple of calls to the Hill and shut this whole thing down.  Did anyone talk to him?
... go on.
Cox!  Fire him.
The hell he will!  Fire him, too.  If you have to go all the way down to the janitor at the Justice Department, fire the sonofabitch!  And ...
So?
Can we get around this, Al?
That's right ...
I don't know anything about that.
It's possible they were looking for evidence of an illegal Howard Hughes donation to the Democrats, so the Democrats couldn't make an issue of your Hughes money.
What's Liddy got?
Our own intelligence capability -- to fix the leaks?
Silence!
"National Priority."
No, keep Trini out of this. Chotiner's too old.  And for God's sake, keep Colson out.  It's time to baptize our young counsel.  That means Dean can never talk about it.  Attorney-client privilege.  Get to it.  And Dean -- you stay close on this.
He'll need a pretext.  He'll never figure one out for himself.
The only problem with that, sir -- it gets us into obstruction of justice.
Dick, you don't have to make a statement.  Herb covered it for you.
Before?!  Eisenhower approved that?
Because he didn't even know about it. The CIA never told him, they just kept it going.  It was like ... it had a life of its own.  Like ... a kind of "beast" that doesn't even know it exists.  It just eats people when it doesn't need 'em anymore.  Two days after the Bay of Pigs, Kennedy called me in.  He reamed my ass ...
Probably flunking, nothing to do except come down here and meet girls. Henry's out there with them.
I believe you're right, boss.
This could be it ... this could be it. Four long years ...
... beating out the other papers, chasing girls ...
How?
Put Townsend in Belgium; it's available.
No ...
Sir ... six bodies.
Is it my turn?
Thou must.
Did he have to die for me to get it?!
I said I didn't need a free ride.  I need a suit.
I'd rather get a whipping than have another talk with her.  Anything but a talk with her.
My friends call me "Mister President."
You're correct.  I'm concerned these students are being funded by foreign interests, whether they know it or not.  The FBI is worthless in this area.  I want your full concentration on this matter ...
I'm interested in the documents that put your people together with ... the others.  All of them ...
I'm not Jack Kennedy.  Your agency is secure.
I promised the American people peace with honor in Southeast Asia.  That could take time -- two, maybe three years ... In the meantime, your agency will continue at current levels of funding.
... But it has never been the policy of this government to accept that. And it is certainly not CIA policy.
You asked if you could count on my support ... As long as I can count on yours.
The White House.
Dogs ... Season starts tomorrow.  It keeps me calm.  I don't like going back into the same building four times.
"A warrior with nerves of steel is yet broken by a thread of silk." Nietzsche.
Party ain't started yet, Dick.  Got these gals coming over to the ranch later for a little private "thing," y'know ... There's some fellows I want you to meet.
It's nobody's fault, Jack.  It's change -- which is a fact of history. Even that old cocksucker Hoover's dead.  Things change.
What do you mean, Jack?
Mr. President, this cannot be breathed!  Especially to our secretary of state -- that cretin Rogers ... The Chinese would never trust us again. The only way, I emphasize only way, to pull this off is in secret.
But it must be done; your government is paralyzed.
I ... I heard something ... It sounded idiotic.
Yeah ...
Fung pi!   I've only managed to change a few things around the city of Beijing.  I want to know your secret.
Mr. Chairman, there is an old saying: The enemy of my enemy is my friend.
Free, if you're the president.
Kissinger's misunderstood.  He pretends to be a liberal for his Establishment friends, but he's even tougher than I am ...
You know, this kinda thing, you gotta be brutal.  A leak happens, the whole damn place should be fired.  Really. You do it like the Germans in World War II.  If they went through these towns and a sniper hit one of them, they'd line the whole goddamned town up and say: "Until you talk you're all getting shot."  I really think that's what has to be done.  I don't think you can be Mr. Nice-guy anymore ...
Make some money, Dick, prove yourself to the Wall Street crowd and let Goldwater and Rockefeller take the fall against Kennedy.
They were throwing rocks, John, just rocks.  They don't think I feel ... but I feel too much sometimes.  I just can't let a whole policy get dominated by our sentimentality.
I wanna fight just as dirty as he does.
Syracuse.
Oh, I like satin, I like pink ...
I like jazz ...
I know.  I know.  I've seen a lot of kids die, too, in World War II.
It sounds like you're talking about a wild animal.
POWs.  And their families.
Yes, yes.
It's not fair, Buddy.  I can take the insults; I can take the name-calling. But I can't take the losing.  I hate it.
Not that.  Us.
The girls will grow up.  They only know you from television anyway.
You're ruining us.  If we stay with you, you'll take us down with you.  This isn't political, Dick.  This is our life.
That's what you said the first time we met.  You didn't even know me.
Do you really want this, Dick?
And then you'll be happy?
Can I just ask for one thing?
Well enough.  You're looking "happy," Nelson.
To what?
No, but I liked your book on nuclear weapons.  We have similar views on the balance of power ...
She just told me you was quittin'. Sit down.
In Angola. Yeah.
No, I mean was it right away or in the night or when was it.
Couple hundred on his person. Those hombres would've taken the stash.
It's the tide. It's the dismal tide. It is not the one thing.
I don't know. Sometimes I think he's pretty much a ghost.
I wish I could say that was in his favor. But I have to say I don't think it is.
Yeah, right. Sheriff, can you give me your word on somethin'?
If I tell you where Llewelyn's headed, you promise it'll be just you goes and talks with him -- you and nobody else?
Llewelyn would never ask for help. He never thinks he needs any.
No.
Yessir. We should a brought wieners.
The old boy shot by the highway?
Yessir. But then there's this other. He nods up the ridge away from the highway.
You sure?
Llewelyn Moss?
Mm.
I don't know...
Believe you're right.
So when was he here?
No, that's the only thing I would've looked for. And it sounds like these boys died of natural causes.
That's very nice.
Lord no. I'm not retired.
I didn't see my Prednizone.
I ain't got the money.
What little I had is long gone and they's bill aplenty to pay yet. I buried my mother today. I ain't paid for that neither.
...I need to sit down.
What? Quit hollerin'.
Yeah.
Your mother's dead, Llewelyn.
Why would we go to Odessa?
Things happened. I can't take 'em back.
Yes I do.
Yes ma'am?
I shall return.
Why would I let you do that?
You mean the nature of this conversation?
Where does he work?
Did you not hear me? We can't give out no information.
I need you to step out of the car, sir.
In the truck.  I'll get it.
You know she won't be there.
Yeah I'm goin' to bring you somethin' all right. I've decided to make you a special project of mine. You ain't goin' to have to look for me at all.
Sixty-nine cent.
I seen you was from Dallas.
I don't know. Will there?
You already asked me that.
See about closing.
Sir?
Well...
I don't have some way to put it. That's the way it is.
I didn't put nothin' up.
No.
...Where you want me to put it?
Never mind.  I want a tent.
The kind with the most poles.
Let me have that one. Where's the nearest hardware store?
What room?
How well do you know Chigurh.
Okay. We can stop that.
I'm sorry.
I'm just one person. Don't matter the size of the bed.
Another additional.
I got beers in my room.
Oh. That's who you keep lookin' out the window for?
I know how he found me.
He isn't. You're not cut out for this. You're just a guy that happened to find those vehicles.
What product.
No I don't have it.
I don't know. American citizens.
No sir.
No sir. I'm a veteran.
Yes sir. Two tours.
Oh, right... 's fine. Thanks.
It's fine. Mind your own meal...
They're just eggs, Elden, how embarrassing can eggs be?
Who eats eggs for lunch, anyhow?
She knows who killed Del. Elden, she said it was a woman.
They no longer live in tepees, Mr. College Graduate.
You just go write your little story, Roy. I'll handle the police work...
Yeah?
That's it! YOU'RE GONE!
You just don't know when to quit, Roy! You were jealous of me when I got hall monitor in seventh grade, and you're still jealous now!!!
I'd like to apologize for our local boy. He's been in love with Betty since the fifth grade, y'see. He means well, but he's in over his head on this.
We think we know where Betty is.
Worry about your own goddamn lunch!
No, I didn't have to.
Little place called "Williams," why?
I'm not going out there! Let's wait for the real police...
"Banners?"
They're fine... you miss it?
Drugs? God, no! I'm totally against drugs.
I know. I borrowed it from your grandparents because I... I... it doesn't matter. Don't worry, they're fine...  Look, I used to feel that same way, said practically those same words, sitting at night in a foxhole in Korea...  I've chased you across the country, Betty, and I come to find out we're a lot more alike than you'd think.
Yes, but I'd sort of like to put that behind me now...
I better go check on them.
Yes... Not the actor, though, the doctor. I think.
Of course, he's only here two days a week. He's also on staff over at Loma Vista.
Umm... yes. Back home.
Maroon.  I stole it.
Yeah, me too.
I gotta go make dinner.
Yeah, hon. Real bad. You just get some sleep, everything's gonna be fine.
I take it I should. I'm sorry.
There was no plan! I was just young and stupid and scared!
Oh, David... I'm sorry I caused you that much pain.
...but I love listening to you, so that's okay...
Well, I just feel that life'll be much sweeter for you now with me around. I promise...
Why am I doing this to you? Isn't this what you wanted?
My treat. You were saying... something about how stupid you've been?
Kinda like you'd been saying it since you got on the plane...
All right, then. Actually, I'm glad you're going out. I got something going on tonight. Some serious clients, with real potential.
What?
I got you, Del...
Yeah, I guess there's nothing like watching those tenpins fall, huh, Del?
Make sure it's elevated...
Well, I was worried about you and I wanted to make sure you were alright... and I guess I was sort of hoping I could ask you about what happened...
Ahh, look, right now's not very...
I begged him to let me put that on!
Los Angeles, California.
Did you love it?
Really?
Nice move. Cedars Sinai?
He has no heartbeat!
What are you talking about? This bar is packed with professional people!  Everybody says if you're going to get married, this is the spot to meet someone... Luckily, I'm currently off men, so I've got the luxury of not giving a shit.
God, that's awful!
Her 'head'?! You're making this up...
How many men have I talked to?
You said in L.A., anything goes.
Shhh! I heard you the first time.
...okay.
Yes. I'd never been in a place like that before.
Does he ever talk about medicine? His patients, the hospital?
I'm going back to... I need to... I don't know.
We need someone with the right kind of experience, Lonnie.
No, you're not. You're a good doctor, Lonnie, but you're not David Ravell. I've made my decision. Now, if you'll excuse me...
Thanks so much. You must get bothered by this kind of thing a lot.
No, that should be more than --
Oh, yes, with the coffee...
Ahh... my wife's.
Of what?
Are we gonna do business here, or not?
Driving their cars into trees... puking on the sidewalk... stupid shit!
My socks?
Stupid is calling people in Kansas City who are affiliated with the rightful owners of the thing you stole, and trying to sell it to them. Right Wesley?
You just gonna leave these cars sitting here like this?
...that's a good motto.
I like 'em small. When you're inside a little Asian chick, it's like your dick is the axle that holds her body together.
Actually, I scalped him, and then you killed him.
I can eat because I know we didn't kidnap that woman. I can eat because they aren't looking for us. And I can eat 'cause I'm fucking hungry...  ...relax. She's gonna end up on a milk carton and that's about it.
A 'Finn?' What is a Finn?
Like... us?
I dunno, that lady sounded pretty sure...
...but she's, no, Betty's smarter than that. She wouldn't be here for a...
What's wrong with you?
Oh, five years, give or take.
If it helps bring her back, be my guest...
Yeah, well, I don't have time to screw around. I got buyers in Dallas, Houston and Vegas who are ready to snap this stuff up.
It is, if you like idiots...
I can't tell you how much it hurts me to hear that you married him.
"Would you like ground pepper on that salad, Ms. Branch?" Remember?
No! No problem, there is no...  What is the problem? Just do that... thing... you do! Come on! You drove me nuts with this for three days, now do it!
Better.
Look Joyce, I need your key to the files, not advice, okay? This is a complex case.
You'd like that wouldn't you? You've hated Betty since you were in Pep Squad together...
Ahh, I hate this town! Places like this just make you small...  I should have never come back here after college.
Names, a phone number, something...  Listen, Ballard told me that the guy who brought the missing car down from Detroit was murdered, but do you see him doing anything about it? If Ballard wasn't such a stubborn ass, I wouldn't have to be breaking in here...
The driver was killed. I think there's a connection --
She's a lesbian.
I don't think she will. She's a slut, but I just don't think she's that mean. Jasmine'll bring her around...
It's Sue Ann Rogers, Betty Sizemore's friend? I heard from her.
Once again we find ourselves in agreement.  What kind of work do you do, Big Dan?
Yeah, it stinks in that ol' barn.
No, they never did turn me into a toad.
Don't know, Delmar-though the blind are reputed to possess sensitivities compensatin' for their lack of sight, even to the point of developing para- normal psychic powers. Now clearly, seein' the future would fall neatly into that ka-taggery. It's not so surprising, then, if an organism deprived of earthly vision-
Fire! I hate fire!
Four hundred, Delmar.
I left my pomade in that car! Maybe I can creep up!
Caintcha see it Everett! Them sigh- reens did this to Pete! They loved him up an' turned him into a horney- toad!
Is the marriage off then, Miz Wharvey?
Well now Pappy I wouldn't put it that strong...
Enticements a power, wealth, settera.
...Why you... lyin,... unconstant... succubus!
That's good, honey.
The hell you say! Wash is kin!
Don't I know it.
Join you two ignorant fools in a ridiculous superstition? Thank you anyway.  And I like the smell of my hair treatment - the pleasing odor is half the point.
What about you, Delmar? What're you gonna do with your share a that dough?
Well that hardly sounds like you...
Isn't it, uh...
I shoulda guessed it - typical womanly behavior. Just lucky we left before they came for us.
Damnit, I just hadda bust out! My wife wrote me she was gettin' married! I gotta stop it!
Wait a minute - who elected you leader a this outfit? Since we been followin' your lead we got nothin' but trouble! I gotten this close to bein' strung up, n'consumed in a fire, 'n whipped no end, 'n sunstroked, 'n soggied -
Nearest Ford auto man's Bristol.
I don't carry Dapper Dan. I carry Fop.
Boys, that was some mighty fine pickin' and singin'. You just sign these papers and I'll give you ten dollars apiece.
They cut a record in here, few days ago, old-timey harmony thing with a guitar Accump-accump-uh-
He ain't our daddy!
He's a suitor!
Yes, sir.
Great.
You afraid you'll have to salute me, Chief?
I don't know. That's just how it sounded. Well, I'll see you.
I never said any of that!
Just trying to have fun. That fucking prison is really starting to get to me. C'mon, Seeger. Gimme a push.  Fuck you guys! I'll do it myself!
I don't mean anything by it.
Subic Bay, sir. In the Philippines.
No, sir. You can kick me out, but I'm not quitting.
What is it, the kicks? Is that it?
Yes, sir!
Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.
Do you honestly think you'll find a boy in that... that officer's school who's serious about marriage?
Then you're dumber than I thought! All you'll get from their kind is pregnant!
Yes, ma'am. Four long, hard weeks of sacrifice for my country... for my people... for you. But I survived.
Ashamed? No -- I love you, Lynette. I mean that. After I leave them, I'll meet you at the motel, okay?
My responsibility as its father, for one. I mean, if I've made you pregnant, I'd want to... do the right thing.
Oklahoma. I can get my old job back at JC Penney's. In a couple of years, I'll be floor manager. Oh, you're gonna love Oklahoma, Lynette. You and mama'll get along just great. Of course, money will be a little tight for a while, but we'll make it.
Well, I'll be goddamned.
I got my foot on the floor.
Big Sid came in about two and a half seconds, then had the nerve to ask, 'Did you make it, too, sweetheart?'
I haven't made up my mind.
What do you mean?
No way... Would you?
That don't justify trying to trap a boy by getting pregnant, Lynette! Nothing justifies that. I can't believe you're even thinking like that. I mean, that's really backward.
That there isn't one, as of today. I had my period.  I couldn't believe it. He still wanted to marry me.
Not me.
No. I work for National Paper. It's a good job. I make eight-twenty-three an hour.  When I get enough money saved, I plan to go on to college.
You're better than candy.
Yeah, then if I get jets, it's on to Beeville, Texas.
What would you do differently?
Your real father?
I know that.
I bet you do!
Who's got two bucks? It's costing me every penny they pay us just to keep my old Lady and my kids in that motel.
I don't notice anyone else complaining.
I hate to tell you guys, but only two out of every class make it into jets. Which one of you is going with me?
Not if you make it worth my while. How about free boonies for the duration?
Yeah.
Naw.
That's what they want you to think, but I saw where she lived, what is she's trying to get away from.  Just take my word for it, pard. Break it off now. Do it this week.
I didn't ask you all that, Sweet Pea. I asked if you loved her.
I don't know... I felt like... like I was suffocating... Christ, Zack... I was so scared... so godddamn scared...
Peace out.
God.
Who's the clown now?  Huh?!  Who's the fucking clown now?!
Okay, okay!  Okay.
Hurry up, for Christ's sake!
Are you gonna open the safe?
That's their problem.
You finish.  Then we finish.
This was your department, Junior.
Raoul is cool.  That's all you need to know.
A guy shows you a gun, Burnham, and you insult him?  Hey, who's the idiot?  Huh?
Yeah.  Kidnapping.
Shut up and let me think.
Can't.  Whole point.  Can't get in the room.
Junior, you gigantic idiot, how are we supposed to get into the room if they pass out?
It's quite in vogue in high end construction right now.  One really can't be too careful about home invasion.
I said open the door.
Don't!
No fucking way.
I'm just saying, the man is a problem.  And he's your problem. Wasn't me idea to bring him along.
Don't take no tone of voice with me, Homes.
The hell we are.
Why?
The furniture guy?
The crowd goes wild.
They can't.  They can't get in here. No.  They can't.
Say fuck.
Shhh...
No.
Blue is phones?
He won't even know who it was.
He --
I was trying not to tell you...
No biggie, we've been through it a dozen times, I just jab you with the Glucogen.
Oh, you know, it's uh... it's in the little fridge in your room.
Oh shit Alma... you're...
I have confirmed to you my address, that's all I'm required to by law to do. We have broken no law.
I tell you "officer", it wasn't...
That's just it Huey. The pigs don't know how many Panthers there are. Both of us show and they might start putting 2 and 2 together. We're not even two hundred strong yet... but we got 'em guessing thousands.
Man, El-Rage is El-Rage. You know him.
No more police brutality! WHAT DO WE WANT?
Inspector Brimmer, this is no joke During your surveillance have you seen any outside agitators? Professorial types? Communists?
Like, you Inspector Brimmer are not going to be sitting in your car anymore. I think it's time for a more active type of involvement.
What's with you?
Fuck how they operate. Just do it. like your man says, "By any means necessary."
No man. PE -- "political education."
N... N...... Not... Oh.
Cut the crap, you've been taking the man's money for years. Now it's time you earned it.
And did you witness the shoot-out?
Yeah... but it seems they're bringing Malcolm's widow Betty Shabazz to town, to speak at a rally, do an interview for Ramparts.  And they want us to help with security.
You know I think Brother Judge needs our support right now, not our suspicion  This is beautiful man. Folks around here never read the truth like this before.
Get the brothers a beer. Me too while you're at it.  Men? Well we can spare six for security...
They were empty...
What, I don't know how you mean?
You got that right. And brother, I got a feeling it's going to get a whole lot thicker.
Huey, man who's gonna straighten out the brothers if they get on my ass?
Me too. That's why I fight so hard.
Well, act like it. Come on.
Mothafucker! You just set Bobby Seale up to be kidnapped. They dragged him off to some bullshit conspiracy trial in Chicago. How much the pigs pay you for this one, Judge? 
Look... You... take her and get the hell out of here. I'll keep 'em busy.
I don't know.  But I'm sure I'll find out. Rose, you did me solid.
What?
Why didn't you tell me?
Lord, never thought I'd live to see my boy in prison.
Mom, black folks been praying to God for four hundred years. Maybe it's time we tried something else...
That would be nice, too.
No, he takes after his mother...
Thank you.
Do you?
Yes, sir.
Apology accepted.
Oh.  Very well, then.  Would you, as the initiating party, like to begin?
Very well, proceed, sir.
If that's your position, then eighteen of your officers will die. Nineteen, if you hang me with my men.
Sir.
The British army is barricaded in Boston.  Harry Lee, is here from Virginia, recruiting for a Continental Army.
It's safer if we stay together.
She got me at a more impressionable age.
Full sentences.  As if she had been speaking all along.
Granted.  Where are you going?
Your mother asked me the same question around the time you were born.  I was drunk and I was foolish enough to answer her.
Thirteen years...
I was an American, I just didn't know it yet...
Thank you.
Last anyone saw, riding hard, northeast, his staff a hundred yards behind, trying to catch up.
So now Cornwallis will head north, link up with Clinton and finish off Washington.
Long time.
How many men does Cornwallis have under his command?
I'm sorry, I didn't know.
No.  It's not over yet.  Two days ride, Yorktown, Virginia. Washington, the French, Cornwallis and Tarleton.  It will end, one way or another.  Francis, nothing will replace your sons but helping us will justify their sacrifice.
Thank you.  Maybe all of this will buy him some peace.
Thank you.
I'm familiar with appropriate behavior at a military parley.
That will be all, Major.  I'll wait for Lord Cornwallis.
Don't depend on my decency.  I'm one of that sort.
But it's already been two years and that's two more years.  The war could be over by then.
But father, they might come this way.
I'm Ellen Creed and I live at 642 Alden Lane, Dearborn, Michigan.  At least, I used to.
Well, it still says some animal got laid down here after, don't it?
He can if He wants to. He can do anything, just like Inspector Gadget on TV. But I have to keep things ready for him, that's what I think. I've got his picture and I'm going to sit in his chair--
In a minute, hon. Let Gage finish his turn.
Yayyy!
To remember.
Lovey...Church might be still alive when you're in a high school...and that's a very long time.
Yes.
I hate that smell.
Jud, do you remember the name of the student that died on Louis's first day at work? The one that was hit by a car?
Movin' in's mighty thirsty work. I usually sit out on my porch of an evening and pour a couple of beers over m'dinner. Come on over and join me, if you want.
Ain't it just? The man who invented beer, Louis, that man was having a prime day for himself.
The Eat A Peach album. God, they were good before drugs and bad luck caught up with them. Listen to this, Louis.
I like rock and roll. No...I guess that's too mild. I love it. Since my ears started to die out on me, it's the only music I can really hear. And since my wife died...I dunno, some- times a little rock and roll fills up night. Not always, but sometimes.  One more time--welcome to Ludlow. Hope your time here will be a happy one.
Yes.
The place we're going is on the other side of that.
Is there quicksand?
Why? For God's sake, why?
Don't worry about that.
It's Ellie's cat.
The power of this place is old and always restless. Sometimes the dead do more than speak. Remember, doc.
Timmy Baterman. That was wrong.
AnaMaria!  Have you seen Gibbs?  I need to put together --
And Jack.  And the crew.  Free and unharmed.  If you agree ... then ... I will remain with you.
That's right.
Aye, for us there is.
Now.  No, don't kill him.
And he's got Old Bill's courage. A curse on him, and you!
By the powers, you're right!  Where's Jack's pistol?  Who's got it?  Bring it forward!
My holds are bursting with swag. That bit of shine matters to me ... Why?
It's a pirate medallion.
Think again, Miss Swann. Vile and dissolute creatures, the lot of them. I intend to see to it that any man who sails under a pirate flag, or wears a pirate brand, gets what he deserves: a short drop and a sudden stop.
I can't breathe.
And that's what concerns me. Elizabeth, we will be landing in Port Royal soon, and beginning our new lives. Wouldn't it be wonderful if we comport ourselves as befits our class and station?
Is an occasion necessary for a father to dote upon his daughter with gifts?
Tell the captain that I am disinclined to acquiesce to his request.
Me!
Don't be thinking I'm not already working on it.
Welcome to the Caribbean, love.
A month?  Will doesn't have a month!  We've got to do something to help him!
Now I must hear this song.  An authentic pirate song.  Have at it.
Not if the fool has something Barbossa wants.  Something he needs.
She can hold a bit longer.
Ah, that's a dark and unpleasant tale, best left untold.
We're not going to just surrender!
Will -- it'll go worse for us -- for Elizabeth, especially -- if we fight.
Wait for my order -- what the blazes is that?
Smith.
Captain Jack Sparrow.  If you please.
Funny, I was thinking along those lines.  How about you let me go in alone, and while you're setting up an ambush, I'll trick the pirates out to you.
I'll be at the wheel myself.
You threatened Miss Swann.
Pirate.
No.  I can not just step aside and let you escape.
Somewhat.
Surely you've heard the stories? The Black Pearl sails from the dreaded Isla de Mureta ... an island that cannot be found -- except by those who already know where it is.
And you want to turn pirate yourself?
Good.
Remarkable how often those two traits coincide.
Aye!  Avast!
It's not true my father was a pirate.
My father did not think of my mother -- his family -- as a burden.
The pistol.  When a pirate is marooned, Will, he's given a pistol with a single shot.  No good for hunting, or surviving, really.  But after three weeks of starvation and thrist -- the option of that pistol begins to look good.
Depends.
This way!
Yes, I have.
But I've seen a ship with black sails.
Please.
But in another twenty-four hours the core meltdown will be beyond the stabilization period.  There will be no way to stop it.
If you'd like, we can go straight to the authorities.  I understand they are very interested in talking to you.
You're not rotting meat.
Icarus, please, if you want me to give you a bath just say so.
She's lying.  She lost the first one on purpose.
She let it escape because she wants me to die.
That remains to be seen.
Why are there two ottomans?
Poppy, please, just tell me what you want.
I'm so excited, Icarus.
Considering what?
In the meantime, why don't you find something useful for Dr. Bright to do.
You have no idea what this is doing to your body.
Why don't you just put this in your pocket so when you see a garbage can you can put it where it belongs.
Look, asshole, I don't got time for this.  If you got a problem, you better take care of it yourself.
That's right.  C.D.C. found out and closed them down...
They'll in validate the key. Probably nothing.
Dr. Argon, I know you want to use the nanobot on yourself, but you mustn't.  The situation is critical right now.  The replicators are growing exponentially.  If we wait much longer it will be too late. You have to use the nanobot to stop the meltdown.
Susan, Dr. Argon is giving you an opportunity here.
It's Sim.  We're almost there.
I've only been invited to her house once, but I know there is a basement lab that she uses for private research.
And if we evacuate, what do you want to do with O'Brien?
Been out for six months now.
You know, this and that.
It was a long time ago, Daniel.  We were young, different people, heading in different directions. That's all.
That's what I thought.
We'll see how wonderful it is after you spend the next twenty years making Agent Orange.
I can't help it, Suze.  It's this place.  You know how I get in these stores.  They freak me out.  All these tiny boxes, little cans filled with eight syllable God knows what.
The nanobot is still inside you. It's programmed to exit through the urinary tract.  We need it as soon as possible, so swallow those.
That was 'simple'?
With enough exposure, the same thing they do to everything else.
That's right.
You're the doctor.
I'm sorry, Daniel, but you have to admit it's pretty ironic that you of all people would be the first man ever polymerized.  It's got to mean something.
Just giving credit where credit is due.
Probably the caffeine.
The nanobot... it's not here...
I think it would be better for me to go alone.  I'm sure Sim is looking for you.  Just sit tight.  I'll bring you back a pizza.
I was hoping you were over that. Remember to keep drinking fluids.
Sort of.  We used a process similar to the vulcanization of rubber and added bulk with a chain of chloroprene elastomers.
On the counter.
You didn't think I could just leave you?
What could happen?  I'm the plastic man, remember?
I'm not leaving without you, Susan!
Yes.
I have to!
I remember I was trying to help...
We were different people then.
Yeah, and what might that be?
You won't.  That's why you're whispering.
'Paranoia is what separates the secured from the unsecured.'
Thank you. I'll go and look for her at once. Goodbye, Mrs. Smith.
Decent? Why Miss Schuyler, I want to be noble.
Certainly. Right over there.
Yeah, that was considerate of me. I recommend you read it.
For what?
Well, you could make this table a little - uh - a little less wide.  There is something you can do for me, Miss Schuyler.
Yeah, I haven't figured out the plot yet, but it's laid in a Siberian village.
When 'we' . . .?  You mean, you'd like to have me live here in your house?
But we don't need it, I'm sure.
It isn't cheap. It's nice.
Little - couldn't be an automobile, could it?  Well, well! Ain't that nice!
Oh, you can't carry a tune - you can't carry a tune - all you are good for is to sit and spoon, spoon. Oh no, I won't wear garters
Will you stop being silly, Stewart?
But I don't want to meet your gang.
You can't walk out of here like this.
That's ridiculous.
You're the Tribune man?
Is that so?
I certainly will.
Oh boy, I'd love it.
Yeah?
With me you can always do business.
The human cash register. Got her hooks into the Schuyler kid, eh?
All right. Give me a voucher for expenses.
No? Well, where were you when that happened?
Yes, sir.
Baloney!  Joe! Bring me a special!
A what?
My play.
Siberian bloodhound?  No. That's been all rewritten. It's laid in Araby now.
I'm not quitting!
I'm your valet, sir. Dawson is the name, sir.
Quite so. Quite.
I beg your pardon, sir?
That's a canary! Who brought that in here? Canary, huh? Go on, get that out of here. Get that out of here!
A bird! A bird in a gilded cage! Get that thing out of here!
There's the third one. If I don't get the last one, there's a certain sob sister I know that's going to get a kick right in the . . . oh! Whoops, almost had that.
On now, Stew, don't be too hard on her. I wouldn't call her a brewery horse.
Well!
I didn't run away.
Sure. I wish you all the luck in the world, pal.
I hope you'll be very happy.
Who - Anne? Sure, Anne would love that.
Well, if she doesn't want to come, I'll come down alone.
Pay attention? I'm not paying any attention to him. You think that guy could get me upset? Hah! Not that mug. He's a tough mug - hard, cynical. He doesn't know the fine things in life - that guy.  A bird in a gilded cage, huh? It's getting so a guy can't step out without being called a magnolia. Stew Smith, a magnolia! Not me. Say, I'm not going to hang around and be a speakeasy rat all my life! I'll tell you that. Not me, not me. I'm going to step out and mean something in this world. You watch me.  Say, am I a lucky guy to be near Anne Schuyler?  I've been hit with a carload of horseshoes, and believe me I know it. Lucky, I'll say I'm lucky!  Don't you think I'm lucky, Gallagher?
I knew you would, pal.  A bird in a gilded cage, eh?
Her family? Oh, they'll be all right. I'll bring them around.  Gilded cage?!  Besides, I'm not marrying her family. Stew Smith in a gilded cage! Stew Smith? Ha!  That mug. What does he know?
Nothing.
I see. Hank brought them all. That's all right. We'll give them a drink and throw 'em out. How's that?
Been where?
Surely, sit down. If I had known you were coming, I would have thrown you up a waffle.
Come right in - I'll get you a drink.
Pardon me, madam - but what am I to say to the newspapermen?
Why
With pleasure, Madame!
Have you seen this? 
I beg your pardon?
Yes, I'm sorry, I struck him right here in your house. And I'll strike anybody in anybody's house that calls me a Cinderella Man.
Sure I'm insane, but I've got some good news for you.  This magnolia is leaving your sweet smelling vanilla joint. This bird in a cage is gonna button his own pants from now on. And that is what is known as telling the mother- in-law.
Now the lady said you may go
No, sir!
No, sir.
Well, sir, I putter.
Oh no, sir. I putter with me hands.
Well, if I couldn't be a good putterer, I wouldn't want to putter. But why? What makes you think I couldn't be a good putterer?
Well, Gallagher, you certainly took no chances, did you?
Yeah?
What do you mean?
We're in Pleasantville?
It can't be possible.
In my handbag.
No ... They won't be able to tell.
Thanks.
No ...
But I really should get home.
Yeah. It does.
Yeah.  Or like sprinklers in the summer ...
No I'm not.
It's fine. You'll put on some make up and ...
I don't want it to go away.
Really Biff? The keenest?
Gosh. I hardly know what to say.
Oh you bet.  Will you excuse me for a sec?
Oh, Biff. You can "pin" me any time you want to.
So.
With what?
What's the matter?
No. Of course not.
Oh my Gosh. I hardly know what to say.
Yes I do.
It was accessible to everyone.
But see that's just the point. It can't stop at once. Because it's in you. And you can't stop something that's in you.
Oh sure it is.
What?
Um ... Outside of Pleasantville.
Look it doesn't matter. It's not important.
Oh yeah. A Buick. It's swell.
The other one?
Forget it Jen, I've waited a year for this.
Get lost!
I don't know.
What's going to happen?
We're supposed to be in school.
We just gotta play along for a little while ... till that guy shows up again. Then I'll talk to him and ...
Well, yeah. I'm ... Bud Parker and you're ... um--Mary Sue.
I like--really need a cigarette, too.
It's in your closet.
They don't notice that kind of thing.
Gee whiz "Bud", what could we possibly need when we have each other?
David, nobody's happy in a Poodle skirt and a sweater set.  You like all this don't you?
I just don't think we have the right to ...
Nothing.
Yeah. Can't believe you started such a dorky fad.
That's great.
I've done the slut thing, David. It's really kinda old.
Oh, no ... You baked those for Whitey.
Well--it all just keeps going. Roads ... rivers ...
I'm not sure.
Easy. Mr. Jenkins. What JOB did Mr. Jenkins have?
Ooomph?
But you don't know how long I've been looking for someone like you.
Weil wouldn't you! You look for someone for years ... You pour your heart into it ... This is a privilege you know.  I don't think I better talk about this right now.
Oh, I know they're not. But I mean-- they're just "cookies" after all ...
Well they're not just cookies. I mean, they're great cookies ... Look, I'd love to get into this whole thing but I'm really running late. Why don't we hook up tomorrow?
Terrific. I'll talk to you then.
Oh. I'm sorry--refresh my memory. What episode does the orgy happen in, again?
Oh--what's the point, Bud?
What are you talking about! You make hamburgers! That is the point!
Just listen to me ...
I'll never be able to do that.
I don't know what I'd do if I couldn't paint anymore Bud. I just don't know what I'd do ...
Just a little--You know.
What's the rush?
You just fucking said "chat," that is so -- what are you now? "chat." I'm just calling to make sure you show up at this party tonight.
I don't know...I mean: I don't know.
There's this girl, this friend of mine from work that I think is really cute and really cool and I want you to meet her so I was thinking about bringing her to the party tonight.
Why?
I'm not really asking you, I'm telling you.
I'm trying to get you a girlfriend.
Hello everyone.
Well I'm glad you didn't, thank you.
I don't know.
I'm sorry.
I feel really on the spot now.
I didn't ask him that. He's lying.
It's not mine.
I have no idea.
Call me later.
I'm in my bedroom.
Do you like porno movies?
Yeah? So what are you doing, then?
I'm wearing a t-shirt and panties.
Yeah....you're married aren't you, Jack?
...yeah.....
Sometimes when I'm lonely.
You sound very cute, very nice.
I have my own business....I work. I work hard at doing my business.
Georgia.
It's ok that I'm calling, right, I mean? It's ok.
No. I'm sorry.
We got disconnected before....
I didn't lie.
You've just made a war that you cannot afford.
They don't get opened until eight.
Not very well.
It's ok. That's ok. How long have you worked with Elizabeth?
Really?
Ok.
Sure.
Sure.
Yeah.
Yeah?
Your sister was telling me a pretty funny story about you, when you guys were kids and you were building a ramp for your dog and you threw a hammer through a window? Is that right? You threw a hammer through a sliding glass door?
I'll be around and back in town in a few days --
You don't think you'll go --
Yeah.
Ok.
...I don't know what you mean....
Lena?
Do you want to meet me and talk about this stuff?
Yeah.
Can I come home with you when we get there?
What is this?
If you give me six to eight weeks I can redeem the mileage and then I can with you wherever you have to travel......
It's fine. I can just get you at your office.
Did you do it?
Well who did?
Sorry.
......and this is confidential?
Barry Egan.
337-09-9876. But I don't want anyone to know my name.
YOU FUCK OFF. YOU FUCK OFF AND DIE I WILL HURT YOU FOR HURTING HER. YOU HURT HER.
I didn't know you had a sister?
Hi Walter.
Business is very food, thanks. ELIZABETH What's very food?
That was weird. I meant good.
I'm sorry.
Hi, Lance.
I'll tell you...the guy...with...just talk to me later about it, ok?
I have to talk to you in a second about that, Lance, ok?
Where you goin?
Is this where you live?
Alright, alright.
Well....what do you want, then?
I thought Latisha said you would --
Uch. Shut up, Dean.
He's being weird, I'm sorry. I have no idea why he's being weird and dressed in a suit --
You ready?
He did seem a little strange.
It's remarkable, Doctor. The patients are so subdued; so docile.
Ever since his unfortunate death, there's been a surge of interest in his work. I'll use the profits to restore Charenton to her former glory.
For fuck's sake, who else would it be? The witching hour's arrived; you've alerted the others, yes?
At your service, Count.
"One day, Fanchon was visited by a surgeon. He ran his fingers across her naked skin, pulling apart folds of flesh, inspecting follicles..."
I've you to look after me, haven't I?
We treat you well enough here, don't we Marquis? Your very own featherbed, in lieu of a straw mat. Your antique writing desk, all the way from LaCoste. Enough quills to feather an ostrich --
What did you do? Bribe one of the guards?
Do I have your word?
Don't be absurd; it's only a play.
You can't --! You mustn't --! I've all the demons of hell in my head; my only salvation is to vent them on paper --
That monstrous God of yours? He strung up his very own son like a side of veal; I shudder to think what He'd do to me.
I don't know who you insult more; her or me.
His rug.
Because your writing continues, unchecked.
I wasn't talking about Madeleine.
You're no stranger to rape, Marquis; and yet with her, you cooed. You courted. You begged.
Tomorrow, we'll cut out your tongue.
Of course.
Do you favor its publication?
Shut down?
I spoke to him with reason and compassion; the tools which serve us best here.
He's sworn to obedience.
You keep strange company, Abbe. But if you truly have matters in hand here --
And my own.
Monsieur Masse says he'd like another manuscript, quick as you please. He's got himself three presses, and he can't print 'em fast enough.
Maybe someday you'll tell me your name.
The climax comes at a higher cost; you must sit on my lap.
What's that then?
Tortures so arcane, so medieval, even I haven't the words to describe them. If you've an ounce of pity in your heart, you'll throw caution aside, and unlock my door...
They decreed me a savage, and now they have made me one.
Of course.
Am I a cursed woman, Doctor? Must I be betrayed by every man I meet --
....shame on you, truly...
Forgive me, I beg you --
They've put you up to this, haven't they?
I wonder sometimes.
Carole, you wound me! As if I could hope to pacify you with evasions of--
Why don't you come down to LA? Stay with us for a while.
Sure
Thinking like that is only gonna drive you nuts You were a great star and you had a good run. That oughta be enough.
To make pictures.
Do you?
Randolph!
Yeah
There's no call for that language-
How much?
Bought and p-p-paid for. Just like one of his goddamn statues. Well at least in the movie he married her!
I will not defend my life to you--
You needn't use that language with me
I wanted it
I will not have this in my home.
Yes?
Sir?
Sir, I-
"A toast then, Jedediah, to love on my own terms. Those are the only terms anybody ever knows, his own."
Orson, hold on. Look into my eyes. Tell me you are not doing Hearst.
Right-
Like a bug.
Sure. Dropped her out of his Lockheed over Utah
The old man has his own way of doing things
No, baby, those are the hands of a killer
Okay, boy wonder, what?
Image a man that has shaped his time. A titanic figure of limitless influence. Think about empire. A man with an empire at his feet. A man, like a baron, living in a palace, a glorious palace on a hill, and controlling the permutations of everyone beneath him. Feudal.
Image the possibilities as this man controls the public perception of the nation through his--
Listen to you. You child! Men like him don't bother with things like legality. They don't have to. You know why, boy-o?   Power.   Power like you couldn't even begin to imagine.
We're doing Hearst.
How does it feel, Mank? Going up to the palace and making all the lords and ladies laugh as you tell your little stories and beg for crumbs at the table? How does it feel being the ugly little monkey they keep to amuse themselves--?!
Like a jewel. Turn it in the light and a different facet is illuminated.
Yeah, but the margins are real wide.
Short enough. But this is a grand start And I think we need to change the name.
No, AMERICAN is a blessed title directly sent from God's soul to your mind. We shall never change that! I mean the name of the publisher. Charles Foster Craig doesn't have the knives-out poetry I need. I was thinking about "Kane" -- you like that?
Uh huh.
What does this have to do with--?
What?! Are they going to kill me? Is that what they're going to do?!
You wrote the damn thing, Mank Aren't you going to fight for it?!
Herman.
Yes.
Again.
Again
Again
Listen, get off your horse with me. You know I've stuck by you since the beginning of time it seems like, while the stockholders in New York were ready to cut and run and everyone else in Hollywood was set to toss me in a rubber room. But your contract stipulates a max budget of 500 thousand. This one's gonna come in at 750 thousand. What do we do about that?
Jesus
"Do what you can"?! That's not good enough I
Why don't you just have the guts to admit it
The Palace in New York. But Orson there's something else.
Yes! Vibrant and modern and stark like a Picasso sketch drawn to flashes of lightning I We shoot the whole thing in the gallant American West--
I know where you're from. You guys look the same every place.
Tommy, Jake respects you. He won't even say hello to anybody else -- you know that. But you know when Jake gets set on somethin', Jesus Christ Almighty could get off the fuckin' cross and he ain't gonna talk him out of it. I'm his kid brother. I got no say with Jake on this. He thinks he can buck everybody and make it on his own.
I'd like to talk to Jake a minute.
It's not done.
Where's your wife, Jake?
Nothing...
I ain't ever gonna fight Joe Louis, that's what's the matter.
I tell you one thing. Ok, I'll never be big enough to fight Louis, but I know Joey, I know...
Jack! Enough!
See that, I don't feel it. I can take it. I know I can take anybody.
What are you getting so hot about -- Tommy Como told him to come down here...
I don't like all those other clowns around. That's all I know.
No, but Jake... how much abuse can you take.
I'm the only guy ever to beat Sugar Ray, and I still don't have a shot at the title.
Don't be long. I'm afraid with all these tough guys here.
When I'm away, did you ever notice anythin' funny with her? Tell me the truth.
I can't eat a steak. If I eat a steak, I'm gonna have trouble making the weigh-in.
Well, that's what I mean.
When?
It didn't have nothin' to do with you.
I meant, kill everybody. You or me or anybody. You're a big shot. Kill, kill... g'head.
Whadda ya mean?
Stop it. What're you, crazy?
Well, the word is to get a title shot you have to cooperate with the people who control boxing, in New York. And they're saying that you don't cooperate.
How many pounds I gotta lose?
Are you outa your mind? If I come out, I'll lose the title.
Don't talk. Keep at it. Jab, jab, jab. You're ahead on points.
Oh no? I thought you was a movie star.
You don't get nothin' done by watchin'. You just gotta do it. Here, I'll help you.
That's all right. He don't mind.
It's OK.
Jake...
Who asked you?
No, I'm not. I'm looking at you.
Yeah.
Don't ever do that again. You don't  do it!
What's that kissing on the mouth shit?
I took the kids to my sister's.
"Father of the Bride."
I am answering...
With Salvy, eh?
I'm leaving you Jake.
No. This time it's true. I didn't bother to tell you until I had everything worked out.
I got a lawyer, Jake. We're getting a divorce. I'm getting custody of the kids.
He should.
Hey but Joey, you're thinking nickels and dimes. The money's with your brother.
You don't sleep with him. I do. I don't get to breathe without tellin' him. He keeps me in a cage. If he thinks I'm lookin' at somebody the wrong way, I get used as a punching bag. He don't trust nobody. If he saw the two of us talking together right now, you'd be in trouble too -- believe me. Look at me, Joey. I'm 19 years old. I wanna enjoy my life. I love Jake, but you don't know. He gets crazy sometimes. I'm scared.
He has it. Thank you.
That's what they call a family problem.
I'll bet it's been done.
Then where is she -- in the ice box?
What time?
Too bad. The Thorwalds were just leaving the apartment house at that time.
Who left -- where?
Well then do a good job of it! Get over there, and search Thorwald's apartment! It must be knee-deep in evidence.
I mean when he goes out for a paper, or a drink, or something. What he doesn't know won't hurt him.
Ever get an answer?
A possibility.
For getting rid of that cast.
Gunnison -- how did you get to be such a big editor -- with such a small memory?
I didn't ask you to stand in the middle of that automobile race track.
That's more like it. Goodnight, old buddy.
Who are you?
I only have a hundred dollars or so.
Well, I only quote from the best.
How?
Those sultry sun-worshipers you watch haven't raised your temperature one degree in four weeks.
I'm not ready for marriage.
How did you know!
I was.
It's hard to figure. He went out several time last night, in the rain carrying his sample case.
Sometimes it's worse to stay than it is to run.
No. The shades are still drawn in their apartment.
Get back there! He'll see you!
I'll watch the alleyway -- in case it goes that way.
There's something buried there.
What?
You can tell that from here?
Thirty-three here. Totals one-ninety. Not enough.
You haven't even heard from him?
I'm afraid it is, Tess.
Mmmm -- hurts a little.
We sell a dozen a day in this price range.
Hasn't been any big demand for tickets.
I wanted to, Jeff.  Oh!
You mean leave the magazine?
That's what I'm afraid of.  Could you see me -- driving down to the fashion salon in a jeep -- wearing combat boots and a three day beard? 
Not exactly -- but we have a little apartment here that's probably about as popular as yours.  You, of course, remember Miss Torso.
Of course not.
Your mind is. And when I want a man, I want all of him.
I have one now.
Tell me about it.
He likes the way his wife welcomes him home.
Nothing, thank heaven.
Do you think I consider this recreation?
You'd better before you catch the disease!
A lot of things. She's an invalid who needs constant care -- and yet the husband nor anyone else has been in there all day.
What's the apartment house number?
Someone not his wife?
Not a word. He was going to check on the railroad station, and the trunk. He must be still on it.
Women aren't that unpredictable.
Inside stuff?
It's utterly beautiful.  I wish I could be creative.
The same girl who keeps him out of the clutches of seductive show girls, and over-passionate daughters of the rich.
But he never ends up marrying her. Strange.
Now hold on. I'm not a bit squeamish about what might be under those flowers -- but I don't care to watch two women end up like that dog --
Maybe I can get Thorwald out of the apartment.
Think you've got enough for a search warrant now?
I'm glad they let you out.
What?
Somebody find him a knife.
Jim Stark.
Hi.
Yeah.
Down in back.
Nothing, Crunch.  They picked him up like the rest of--
Hang loose.  We got all night.
Hold it, Jim.
You mind if I try?  You have to slam the door in my face?  I try to get to him--what happens?  Don't I give you everything you want?  A bicycle--you get a bicycle. A car--
Yeah!
Is there some kind of trick answer?
I just want to show you how foolish you are.  When you're older you'll laugh at yourself for thinking this is so important--
I'm in terrible trouble.--You know that big high bluff near Miller- town Junction?
Are you listening to me?  You're involved in this!  I want to go to the police and tell them I was mixed up in this thing tonight?
No!  It's nothing!  Just nothing! You always told me to tell the truth.  You think you can just turn that off?
Sorry.
I think I know my son.
Let me just explain to you--we just moved here, y'understand?  The kid has no friends yet and--
Just relax, please relax!
Are you going to preach now?  Are we going to have a sermon?
Where's your mother tonight, Plato?
No, sir.  I just went next door to look at them like I always do. They were nursing on their mother and I did it.  I guess I'm just no good?
I just don't want trouble.
I saw it.  Gee, look at that thing swing, will you?  Do you think it never stops?
Oh, I bet some little guy comes in here at night and pushes it.  Go- go-go!
They're still there!
If you want to come we could talk and then in the morning we could have breakfast like my dad used to--  Gee...if you could only have been my father...we could...
How'd you find me?  What's happening?
Yeah?
Wow!  Well now-there-then!
There's only one key.
Come on!
Man, you're schizoid!
Not lately.
When was that?
You remember that far back?  Boy, I can't even remember yesterday.
I'm fine.
I need it.
Just a guard.
Stop tearing me apart!  You say one thing and he says another and then everybody changes back--
All right, darling.
I have to talk to someone, Mom.  I have to talk to you both.  And Dad this time you got to give me an answer.
Mom--I'm not--
What's that got to do with it?
But you don't think that's a solution.
Here.  Look, will you do something for me?  If the pot starts boiling again, will you come and see me before you get yourself in a jam? Even if you just want to talk--come in and shoot the breeze.  It's easier sometimes than talking to your folks.
Any time--day or night.  You calmed down enough to go back now?
Now that's true!
Where what was.
Dig the square wardrobe!
University and 10th--Want to carry my books?
A what?
I'm sorry I treated you mean today. You shouldn't believe what I say when I'm with the kids.  Nobody acts sincere.
I felt like it.
I'm never going back.
You see, we've just--oh, you tell him, darling.  I'm so embarrassed I could die!
There's just one thing.  What about--
I bet you hear everything I say!
Are you?
I know already.  We don't have to pretend now.
You disappointed?
It is for me too.
Sure.  He was trying to make us his family.
Yes.  My best friend.
Yes.  And so terribly annoying when they cry.  I just don't know what to do when they cry, do you dear?
He hates me.
I don't think.  I know.  He looks at me like I'm the ugliest thing in the world.  He doesn't like my friends--he--
Yes!  I don't know!  I mean maybe he doesn't mean it but he acts like he does.  We're altogether and we're going to celebrate Easter and catch a double bill.  Big deal.  So I put on my new dress and I came out and he--
I was just talking a walk.  I tried to call the kids but everybody was out and I couldn't find them.  I hate my life.  I just hate it.
I'll never get close to anybody.
My mother?
What?
GABRIEL, I LOVE HIM!
I promised that when he helped us, we'd be gone! When he helped us! Loverboy don't want to play!
No, baby. He wants me.
...whoever she is.
That's for the hundred bucks worth of pay-per-view.  And that's for the two hundred you took outta your minibar.
Thank you.
Radio said negative five.
Radio said.
One more. Smile. One more.
I'm talking about the heart, Nick. I'm not talking about the words.
Provisions! We are not leaving that motel room again till after New Year's: we need ten days worth of provisions!  What's good?!
Can't survive on our bodies alone, Nick.  Hurry up!
Beauty and fragrances.
Blackjack, Nick, blackjack I am good at. I mean, they'd give us some free games or something, wouldn't they? Since you worked there?
He's not a bad person, Nick... he's not...
Nick, no --
Nick, it won't work. It won't work!
He didn't "find" Nick's letters, did he.
You told him about Nick's letters.
Just tell him what you know, Nick! That's all they want! And we'll get out of this!
But you knew why. Knew why, didn't ya.
Well, shit, Judas, you shoulda at least gotten that --
No. He wants to be working for himself someday.
Nick, the ice is --
...Haven't had cranberry buns... in five whole years...
Ash. Don't say it. Don't say my name.
What?
I don't know...
Nick, what are you talking about?
If he wanted a photographic memory, he shoulda kidnapped one. I'm working on it here.
Rudy. How'd you know my name?
You got the wrong guy! She thinks I'm Nick, I'm not!
I got out, Nick didn't! I pretended I was him! I knew about her letters! Jesus Christ, whatever you want from him -- I'm not Nick!  I -- I just wanted to be --
Yes!
I never worked at no casino.
Heyyy. Be nice, convict. We're gonna be working together here.  Get him back in the rig.
Bam Bam.
I don't know.
And I worked there. For a year.
You'd have to get me inside.  Get inside, watch where the money's moving, see where the guards are going. Then I could work with your map.
More than you know.
Put it on.
You get recognized, convict, You get a country-western funeral.
Don't tip.
Nothing... I promise-nothing...
Nick. I been trying to hit you.
I have no gifts to bring, pa-rumpum- pum-pum
Six men means six guns.
Well. What you guys have to plan out, then... is how you're going to get to that cage and that security level before anybody realizes anything's wrong. Running in with ski masks and bullets flying ain't gonna do it.
What. We all gonna dress up like cowboys?
Take 'em.
Leave the tree.
Show's over.
What... Powwow...
Where is he?! Where is he?!
Oh. Right. Yeah. That's, uh upstairs. Uh. Here. Powwow Safe.
We're all outta gifts, boys and girls, but we got charitable donations!
There anytime you don't got a mouthful of shit?
I been in Iron Mountain for two years, truck driver. I do one more crime, I'm back there for good, so fuck you and fuck your sister and fuck your trucker friends. You want to hear about some goddamn job of mine? I want some hot-goddamn-chocolate.
You lock down security, you move behind the cage. You hit the Count Room. There'll be a guy in there but he's got no guns; room's accessed by another code. Cashiers'll know it. They'll have alarms.
Merlin, I didn't know --
It's a roach, guy --
I'm just saying.
I'm just talking.
How'd you know I'd do it.
Talked about the old man's weapons stash, probably forgot I'd remember
I... sorry, Mister...
But... I had a five...
Who the hell made this map.
They changed the layout.
I got an idea on that one. Once you're up there, you gotta hold those guards down till some backup can get there. There's a security camera room that videotapes everything. You've gotta destroy every last one of those tapes.
Thanks, don't mind if I do.
No. That your head's been up your ass. I walk through the door and Joe says "Vic, you're back, thank god. Finally somebody who knows what the fuck he's doing. Vic, Vic, Vic, Eddie, my son, is a fuck up." And I say "Well, Joe, I coulda told you that." "I'm ruined! He's ruining me! My son, I love him, but he's taking my business and flushing it down the fuckin' toilet! "  I'm not tellin' tales out of school. You tell 'im Joe. Tell 'im yourself.
You're coming back to work for us, right?
No shit, he's gonna fuckin' die on us if we don't get him taken care of.
Who?
What?
Really? Who's your P.O.?
That's okay, Eddie, I do.
Bullshit.
Nobody did. You assholes turn the jewelry store into a wild west show, and you wonder why cops show up.
Nobody saw what happened to Mr. Blue?
We were trying to find out what he knew about the set up.
It's not the black Beverly Hills, it's the black Palos Verdes. Anyway, this chick, Elois, was a man-eater- upper. I bet every guy who's ever met her has jacked off to her at least once. You know who she looked like? Christie Love. 'Member that TV show "Get Christie Love"? She was a black female cop. She always used to say "You're under arrest, sugar."
What the fuck was that chick's name? Oh this is just great, I'm totally fuckin' tortured now.
...What bar?
You ever seen this motherfucker before?
Yeah.
The things you gotta remember are the details. It's the details that sell your story. Now this story takes place in this men's room. So you gotta know the details about this men's room. You gotta know they got a blower instead of a towel to dry your hands. You gotta know the stalls ain't got no doors. You gotta know whether they got liquid or powdered soap, whether they got hot water or not, 'cause if you do your job when you tell your story, everybody should believe it. And if you tell your story to somebody who's actually taken a piss in this men's room, and you get one detail they remember right, they'll swear by you.
He's a cool guy. A real nice, real funny, real cool guy.
What for?
You two take the manager in the back and make him give you the diamonds. We're there for those stones, period. Since no display cases are being fucked with, no alarms should go off. We're out of there in two minutes, not one second longer. What if the manager won't give up the diamonds?
It's not about a nice girl who meets a sensitive boy. Now granted that's what "True Blue" is about, no argument about that.
I'm gonna do whatever I wanna do with it.
He's doin' twenty years in Susanville.
Goddamn you, Joe, don't make me do this!
He don't believe in it.
Nope.
I don't have the slightest fuckin' idea what you're talkin' about.
Shit, you shoot me in a dream, you better wake up and apologize.
What's my problem? Yeah, I gotta problem. I gotta big problem with any trigger-happy madman who almost gets me shot!
What was that? I'm sorry, I didn't catch it. Would you repeat it?
It's a surprise.
Nice Guy Eddie.
Stay put. Okay, fellas, take a look at the little surprise I brought you.
Larry, I'm so scared, would you please hold me.
It's not good...
Lie back down, and try to -
Uh-uh. I don't tip.
I don't tip because society says I gotta. I tip when somebody deserves a tip. When somebody really puts forth an effort, they deserve a little something extra. But this tipping automatically, that shit's for the birds. As far as I'm concerned, they're just doin' their job.
Oh that's just fucking great! Where's Brown?
What's done is done, I need you cool. Are you cool?
Splash some water on your face. Take a breather.
I'm telling ya, it wasn't that soon. They didn't let their presence be known until after Mr. Blonde went off. I'm not sayin' they weren't there, I'm sayin' they were there. But they didn't move in till Mr. Blonde became a madman. That's how I know we were set up. You can see that, can't you, Mr. White?
That's the way I look at it. A choice between doin' ten years, and takin' out some stupid motherfucker, ain't no choice at all. But I ain't no madman either. What the fuck was Joe thinkin'? You can't work with a guy like that. That motherfucker's unstable. What do you think? Do you think he panicked, or ya think he's just trigger-happy?
What do you think?
How can you be so sure?
Where? Are they out in the car?
That kid in there is dying from a fuckin' bullet that I saw him take. So don't be calling him a rat.
Before you got here, Mr. Orange was askin' me to take him to a hospital. Now I don't like turning him over to the cops, but if we don't, he's dead. He begged me to do it. I told him to hold off till Joe got here.
I don't know anybody.
We don't think this place is safe.
There's a slight difference.
Maybe he did.
I've got eleven horses to get over the mountains before snow catches me and covers the feed.
Like you said, maybe he knows where my ranch is. If he does, he'll be waiting on the porch.
Look of things, she doesn't.
Maybe you won't feel that way after I tell you what I stopped in for.
Too much excitement. How about the surrey. Can you fix it?
Did you ever try taking a bunch of horses over Sonora Pass? It's quite a job.
Course I can't. I'll give you a lift to the first ranch.
It's a long walk back to Aspen.
No, thanks.  I hope we won't be a burden to them.
I suppose it is.
The who?
It's too light yet.
Oh, it did. It had a great deal to do with you.
Yes. But -- that was the other night. Now -- I don't think I would.
If it's pretty speeches you want, you won't be hearing them. Even when I mean 'em, they don't come easy.
All right -- it's said!
Why?
Then don't come sneakin' around a man's camp.
Hello, Miss Wells.
It wouldn't happen to be this...
I don't see no sense to makin' people leave town if they don't want to leave.
A man I used to know.
The thing to do is stick to rabbits.
All right. I'll tell you.
How'd you happen to miss?
I caught up with Lednov in Nogales. He didn't like the idea of comin' back across the border but he came. I turned him over to the sheriff and -- that's the story.
Just the grub box and bed rolls.
You better start.
Sure. What other reason would there be?
All right, you didn't know.
I said I didn't care.
He won't take us.  Don't you want us around?
If you're worried about Mary and me talkin' too much, don't. No matter how many questions your old man asks. We know how to keep our mouths shut.
Don't talk -- eat -- we want to get you well quick as we can so we can all get out of here.
Drink this and stop being silly. Why would anyone want to live in this place. You might as well be dead and buried. Nothing to do but look at mountains. In a week you'd be talking to yourself.  Maybe that's what got you started in the first place.
There, there. Don't you upset yourself --
You wouldn't have a smoke on you, would you?
I like it.
Well cheer, why don't you? No more responsibilities, Mary. Marcia -- Elaine -- me -- all taken care of. Down there feeding horses and raising kids, you won't have a thing to worry about.
Yes, people make me restless.
Why didn't you say you wanted to get married back in Aspen. I told the man in Sonora there were four of us. If only three show up, he might call the whole deal off. We've got to stick together. Like we've always done.
And we're running out of that.
How many ways can a man say no.
Go ahead.  Get in training for the pioneer life. I'm finding the nearest body of water and climbing into it.
Maybe you are. I'm not.
That's it then.
I don't know -- I don't know.
He can wait. Let's stay here until morning.
Will you quit gabbin' and do what you're told.
Why not? You went farther than that last time.
No. We're not stayin' --
You don't read to fill your stomach... Poetry, for instance. All the poems in the world wouldn't fill you half as much as a bowl of eatmeal -- but they make you feel good.
Yeah, I'm fine. I just broke up with my boyfriend, that's all.
Ah, they just don't know you the way I do.
Never happened!
You better be careful. I heard some girl got her ass whooped and jacket stolen earlier today.  Hey, what class do we have next?
It would've just been you, if you would've kept your mouth shut.
What?! What is it, a monster?!
Hey, I have an idea...
Ray, have you been here all this time?
Sure, that would be cool. Friends.
Then what kinda stuff can we do?
It sounds gay, but guess since you're a girl it's okay, huh?
Sure. We can practice talking.
I know, but I've been thinking --
Look, what I'm trying to say --
I think so.
So, whatever happened to her?
Yeah, they're so warm and soft.
Yes, Professor Oldman's group. Forgive me. I didn't mean to frighten you.
I'm Hanson the caretaker.
Don't worry Cindy, the brain itself feels no pain.
Yes, it was me all along. I killed Hugh Kane and his mistress.
My child you are the only survivor.
Aww, you ain't that bad. You just need a little flava. First thing we gotta do is get you some new gear.
Gear. You know, clothing.
Yeah, now go uhn, uhn, uhn!
I told you it would taste just like chicken.
Saw who?!
Are these all the subjects?
Any of them hot?
And what happens when all hell breaks loose?
Right. What about condoms?
Fine.  What's all this stuff?
Let's not forget, folks, this is a study on sleep disorders.
What is it? Some tits? A beaver shot? What?
What?
You do.
And sexy.
Alright, go to the belt store...
How is she?
What?
No, I'm fine.
Yeah, I always wanted to watch you eat.
Get out?! What does it say?
"Fucked me."
The "Citizen Kane" of gore movies.
Hi, Mrs. Sutphin.
I certainly did not.
Aw, Mom! I hate Mr. Stubbins!
Looks good, Mom!
I'm so happy I could shit.
Hold on...  Yeah I am, but you'll have to speak to my agent...
Leave her alone, Chip.  I think it's great she has a new beau, Beverly.
That's nice.
Look officers! Life doesn't have to be ugly.  See the little birdie? Listen to his call.  Peter Pan! Peter Pan! Peter Pan!
We have to concentrate on life, Eugene.
We can be real quiet...
It's a shame. But they should brush their teeth, honey.
Oh, honey!
Yes, I did.
GODDAMN YOU! THAT'S TRESPASSING!
Is this the Cocksucker residence?
Alright, I'll try...  "Cocksucker". That's what she calls me.
It's not fair!!
Let the record show I'm just standing here.
Marvin A. Pickles.
Mother! Did you hear me?! Someone murdered Carl in the mensroom! I saw his dead body!
Rosemary, honey. Good morning. I'm fine.  Thanks for remembering.
Yes, I did. It's terrifying! The police were at my house this morning.
I'm not that bad a driver.  Look at her hair!  Turn it off, honey.
I saw one, but it was ridiculously overpriced!
Yes, but I lent it...
Right here!
Bon Appetit!
He's a good boy.
Divorce? An alcoholic relative?  Tell me, did Chip torture animals when he was young?
Yes you are.
Now, here's a babe!
Yeah - sure.
Okay, Mr. Radeau, it's forgot.
I haven't any money but I'll get a job and --
Why would Mrs. Redi lie to me?
Can we go there now?
I'd like to get out of here.
It doesn't matter. You want to now. You should want to. It's your obligation, your duty.
I thought you told me you didn't know where she was.
If Jacqueline wants money she can come to me herself.
How much have you got?
She's nervous, naturally, under the circumstances.
I can't understand it at all.
Thank you.
Yes.
Why?
Because I loved Jacqueline I thought I knew her. Today I found out such strange things frightening things. I saw a hangman's noose that she had hanging - waiting  I feel as if I'd never known her.
I'm not a youngster. I can understand.
Good.
I saw him on the floor. He was cut -  --here. The blood was running out. He was dead. I'm sure of it. Then on the subway I saw him  white  and the men holding him up between them.
I'd like that.
Oh, I had business with a man... but I missed him -
Good night.
This is the part of New York I love. It is old. It has memories. If you listen, the houses will speak to you. Walt Whitman...Edna St. Vincent Millay... Eugene O'Neill...in their time they've all lived here.
I'm looking for a party -- a merry party.
And then?
Yes.
Yes. And now that I've shown you that I know that much, and can guess more -- will you trust me to look for Jacqueline?
It's all clear to me now -- so clear.
It's because of Jacqueline  I can't go on looking for her --
What's wrong, Mary?
No, not at all, Mr. Jason.
But why come to me?
Actually I want to ask two favors of you -- one as a poet 	one as a detective.
I wanted to get things clear for Jacqueline. Let her know --
Perhaps
I don't know.
One believes - it's like any other religion...
A strange collection. You're like the false god you worship... fallen angels, all of you.
Unless what?
It would be a charming experience. She might only protest half as much.
I never thought you did.
That's too bad.
Why?
She's not been here for a long time.
I don't know no Gibson. This is a restaurant. Many people come here.
Why
False alarm.
I used to take great pleasure in that, being purposefully different, rubbing people's noses in it. Didn't you do that when you were younger?
Anyway, I think the mind is very flexible as far as time is concerned.
Yeah, actually, I do. But John doesn't. At least not right now.
I don't know, he just said he wants to wait. I quit asking.
They are looking at you. Ann, you are truly breathtaking. I don't know if you understand how your appearance can affect people. Men want to possess you, women wish they looked like you. And those that don't or can't resent you. And the fact that you're a nice person just makes it worse.
You had sex with you therapist?
Videotapes.
Why not?
Everything about sex.
Yes.
I'm sorry this came up.
I know.
I know.
Yes.
Why not?
What would you know about a normal frame of mind?
What do you have to do to get ready?
It won't. Are you ready?
Yes.
I fantasized about you.
Yes.
If I can't do it all, I don't want to do anything. And I can't do it all.
So you have had sex.
Who was the last person you had sex with?
What was the problem?
I don't know. It all gets back to that Cynthia thing. I don't like her... eagerness. There's nothing left to imagine, there's no...
Possibly.
I don't know. I really would rather not talk about it.
Yeah, you're right. But I never claimed to know everything like you, and have all these little theories. I'm still learning, I know that. But I don't feel like I've wasted time. If I had to go through my marriage to get to where I am right now, fine.
Who'd you have lunch with?
Are you having an affair?
Is that supposed to comfort me?
But I'm not.
Why don't I believe you?
I don't, either. I mean, Cynthia, of all people. She's so...
Isn't therapy helping at all?
Quitting your therapy won't feed the children of Ethiopia.
I want out of this marriage.
No, but I wanted to. I really wanted to, partially just to piss you off.
Yes.
Don't you think that's a lot of garbage? I'd really like to know where it's all going to go.
What do you mean?
Yes.
I know, but this... I just feel like everybody I know right now is obsessed with sex.
Do you have to say that?
Oh, for God's sake. Really, Cynthia, really, I don't think he's your type.
But he won't.
He's not getting a phone, he doesn't like talking on the phone.
I don't know, I'll get her a card or something.
What's wrong with that?
Will you stop? Jesus.
Good. Now, if you'll pardon me, I have to go to work.
Why not?
Then what's the story, what's this "strange" bullshit all of a sudden? Is he drowning puppies, or what?
Well, what, then?
Oh, so you'll let a total stranger record your sexual life on tape, but you won't tell your own sister?
You are in trouble.
I can't believe you did that!!
Hold on.
Thirty-two dollars.
Well. I can't stay.
Bye.
Did you take your clothes off?
I'm Cynthia Bishop.
You want me to leave?
She still is.
I was... eight years old. Michael Green, who was also eight, asked if he could watch me take a pee. I said he could if I could watch him take one, too. He said okay, and then we went into the woods behind our house. I got this feeling he was chickening out because he kept saying, "Ladies first!" So I pulled down my underpants and urinated, and he ran away before I even finished.
No. If anything, after I looked at it awhile, it got more interesting. It had character, you know?
It was warmer than I thought it would be, and the skin was softer than it looked. It's weird. Thinking about it now, the organ itself seemed like a separate thing, a separate entity to me. I mean, after he pulled it out and I could look at it and touch it, I completely forgot that there was a guy attached to it. I remember literally being startled when the guy spoke to me.
If you wish.  You're not wearing any underwear.
Yes.
Don't give me this passive/aggressive bullshit. If you want to leave, leave. My life doesn't stop when you walk out the door, you know what I'm saying?
No, I mean doing it at my house.
Cynthia. John. Meet me at my house in exactly one hour.
Oh.  Well, when, then?
Then get those balls in the air and get your butt over here.
Cynthia. John.
I like the way he dresses.
"The wrong hands"? We're not talking about military secrets, John. They're just tapes that he makes so he can sit around and get off.
You told Ann about this?
You trust him.
What do you mean?
It'll just be me.
No.  You said three-fifty?
Or go someplace in a hurry.
I need help? Whose sitting by himself in a room choking his chauncey to a bunch of videotapes, Graham? Not me, buddy. You're the fucking nut. Now show me those tapes.
I'm not kidding, Graham, you'd better do what I say. Give me those tapes.
My keys?
I'm not going to give you my keys.
You're hesitating. I think that means you have.
He'll be really mad.
Buy 'em with what, dumbhead?
OK. But late.
A man... I think I recognized him... a man who lives here. He just...  ...he just attacked me for no reason at all. I just opened the door... I was making supper for you, and he grabbed me, he tried to kiss me...
Nope. Damned thing wriggled out of my hands. That's all.
I want to be able to see us, Nick. I... I'm going to go into the bathroom now and put in my contacts, OK? Is that OK?  I want to be able to see us when we make love, OK?
Well, at least you still talk the same.
Rollo, you know me. Once a GP, always a GP.
You oughta be careful yourself. Might end up cutting your throat.
BREAKING OUT
Time to check with Flavors.
As Janet's parents this should be really easy.  Your last clue... Mental Instability.  You have thirty seconds.
You got it!
I'm Janet Majors and this is my husband Brad.
Can I just 'peep in' on Brad before I go home?
After breakfast.  You're sounding tense, Janet.  Maybe I could give you a little massage?
WELL FIRST YOU GO RIP RIP RIP THEN YOU GO SNIP SNIP SNIP THEN YOU WHIP IN A ZIP ZIP ZIP AN' YOU SPLIT IT UP TO THE HIP HIP HIP AN' AS YOU STRIP STRIP STRIP YOU QUIVER AND SHIVER FOR THAT SOFT CARESS AS YOU SLIP SLIP SLIP...INTO THAT LITTLE BLACK DRESS
Jah -- you endorse his product -- He endorses your research.
Yes, Betty.
Shove it, Ralph!
No!  I don't know what Janet's next move will be...but you can be sure of one thing...it all starts here!
I don't want to get up there.
What are you trying to do?  Make Bert look like a fool?  He's made all the arrangements.
He moved all right!  When they found him with fifteen other naked men at the back of Wilson's Bakery.
Of course.
OUR RAVING SAVIOUR THAT'S YOU!!
YOUNG BLOOD
Absolutely true.  Compared to all of them, you are perfection, flawless beauty.
Do you really think so?
But what'll I do?  What'll I say?  What'll I wear?
Yes, Janet.  Leave the crying to Brad.
And you can 'peep in' on Brad in the morning.
SIN-I-FUL
...and an attractive financial prospect for Denton.
Doctor Derek Sommersby? You mean from "One Life to Live"?
I picked him up and I fucked him. I'm a bad girl.
You guys having fun?
And?
Absolutement.  They have their own label that's just outstanding.
You know me. I love it up here. How about you?
Well, you were wonderful on that show. I never understood why they had to give you that brain tumor so soon. Why that didn't make you the biggest movie star in the world is a sin. It's a sin.
I could have made something fancier if a certain someone had let me know that a certain someone was coming for a visit with a certain special friend. Could have made a pork roast.
Oh, yeah. Real well. Still do.
Excellent. My friend and I are up here doing the wine tour, and he tells me that you folks make one hell of a Syrah.
I know. I might need to be spanked.
Me too.
A lot of TV. I was a regular on a couple of series. And lately I've been doing a lot of commercials. National mostly.
Okay, there was a tasting last night. But I wanted to get us some stuff for the ride up. Check out the box.
I don't know. Senior editor? Sounds like you're in to me.
Come on, we're celebrating. I say we pop it.
Jesus. Don't ask questions like that up in the wine country. They'll think you're a moron.
Just a second. Guy's going for $2500.
I'd rather have a knife.
I went on Monday. But I spent most of the time helping him with his computer.
Good, yeah, it is a rose. Only this one is rather atypically made from 100% Pinot Noir.
What color is it supposed to be?
Huh.
I don't know. Wine? Fermented grapes?
Now set your glass down and get some air into it.
Want some?
She is very hot.
And she likes Pinot.
Now I've got another lie to live down. Thanks, Jack.
Shut up.
So what's the plan today?
Do you know how often these pourers get hit on?
Nah. I want to watch this.
Aye-aye, captain.
Count me out.
She's been leaving messages here too.
I will.  See ya!
I may have to put the wedding on hold is all.
Deep.
Understanding of what?
In love? Twenty-four hours with some wine-pourer chick and you think you're in love? And give up everything?
And what about Stephanie? She's a woman -- with a kid. A single mom. What do you think she's looking for? Huh?
Thanks, Jack.
Nope.
Obsessively.
Is what the money thing?
What exactly are we going to do?
You have to tell me --
He wrote a great one on Burgundy, and I used to get his newsletter, but then there were doubts about whether he does all his own tasting. Plus a couple of times he declared certain years vintages of the century, and they turned out to be turkeys. Fucker never retracted.
Put me down, Jack.
Just stop, okay? Make something up, and that's what happened. Whatever you want. Write my confession, and I'll sign it. Just stop pushing me all the time! I can't take it! You're an infant! This is all a big party for you, but not for me! This is serious. And you -- Just... leave me alone, okay? You're fucking me up.
Who's being selfish now? I'm the one getting married. I thought this week was supposed to be about me.
What's up?
Thanks.
I'm going to need an operation. Maybe a couple of them. They have to wait for it it to heal first. Then they break it again.
Gonna fuck that up too. I should sue her ass. Only reason I won't is to protect Christine.
You're joking, right?  What are you doing? Un-fucking- believeable. Can we just go back to the hotel and hang out and get up early and play nine holes before we head home?
No way. No way.
The plan is... you go.
Hrnrnrn?
I'm fine. You rest.
Nothing. Buckle up, okay?
You said it looked like a car accident.
Why don't you come in?
Oh, no, actually. Busy night.
Try it.
Twelve months in oak.
How long have you been into wine?
Yeah, Siena's a sweetie.
Well, it's a little difficult to summarize. It begins as a first-person account of a guy taking care of his father after a stroke. Kind of based on personal experience, but only loosely.
Um... yeah but it's more...
Mrnmm, yeah... but not really. It shifts around a lot. Like you also start to see everything from the point of view of the father. And some other stuff happens, some parallel narrative, and then it evolves -- or devolves -- into a kind of a Robbe-Grillet mystery -- you know, with no real resolution.
My palate's kind of shot, but from what I can tell, I'd dub it pretty damn good.
I suppose I got really into wine originally through my ex-husband. He had a big, kind of show-off cellar. But then I found out that I have a really sharp palate, and the more I drank, the more I liked what it made me think about.
Good. So did I.
Um... did you still want to read my novel?
Oh, yeah. No. I mean yeah, I stopped by for a drink. Didn't see you.
But you wanted to fuck me first.
Yeah.
Miles, maybe it is better if you don't come to the wedding.
Thanks. Um, this is Ken Cortland, my husband.
So how're you doing?
Not me. I'm not drinking.
I'm pregnant.
See you over there, Miles.
Quaffable but far from transcendent.
Exactement!
We were thinking. Why don't we go back to my place? I've got wine, some insane cheeses, music, whatever.
Bye, Stephanie. Bye, Siena, Caryl.
You fucking bastard! Lying piece of shit! You're getting married on Saturday? What was all that shit you said to me?
It tastes old.
She doesn't answer me either.
You don't even know what that word means.
You love walks.
What?  Colleen?... Colleen?
I've had two separate folks tell me they think there are strangers around these parts the last couple of nights. Can't tell what they look like, cause they're staying in the shadows -- covert like. No one's got hurt mind you... And that's the give away.
This is not an intelligent way to approach this.
Curse and stuff.
You want him coming in the house next time?
Did they say what our chances would be if they did invade?
While they were trying to fix her up, all she kept asking about was you.
Graham.
Don't.
Edgar, come inside.
Who wrote this book?
What's two?
Where are we going to sleep?
We'll keep her in the garage, after dinner.
Don't call me Father. It's just Graham now.
The footprints.
What kind of machine can bend a stalk of corn over without cracking it?
It does seem kind of odd doesn't it?
You take care of yourself...  Graham.
He wasn't drinking. Ray fell asleep at the wheel.
It's like War of the Worlds.
No money, eh?
There's nobody coming?
Wait a minute. Get down off of there, Augie.
Someplace safe. How you feeling?
Be careful. You're in it now. And it's gonna get mean.
Right.
Yeah, me and Jake will be heading out for California soon.
Didn't Paden tell you that?
It's one thing to know it...
I'm afraid it is a bad start, friend, 'cause my name isn't Baxter, and he ain't Hawley.
Looks like that's not all they admired.
I've got a job.
I saw the light. I thought maybe Rae had come back to see me. But I never thought it'd be my boy. I never thought that.
I don't believe in luck. I know what Conrad was like. Don't tell me what you think I want to hear.
What's that?
His son is worse than he was. He's smoother, so you don't always hear him coming, but he'll do anything to keep his range free.
He'll be here.
We're going to make some adjustments. I wanted you to be here when I offered Paden your job. I think he could do it without getting greedy. Stella and I are tired of you skimming our profits.
I'm done talking. Get out.
Really?
That ain't right.
We don't serve them here and you know it. I asked him to leave and he went crazy on us. He owes me money for this damage.
So this is the guy you're going to hang?
You didn't tell me you owned a saloon.
Well, thanks, but forget it.
Yeah. Bad luck.  Good-bye, Cobb.
Thanks. That's what I call it too.
Who's the owner?
I'm saving lives here. The straight stuff would raise a blood blister on boot leather.
That's right.  You understand perfectly.  I will confess to fraud, not murder.
Hmm... Mike and Ike's.
-- Viktor, that was Short Subject.
-- I'll tell you why.  It is because Miss Nicola Anders, supermodel with a SAG card God's gift to cinema, has it written into her contract that all cherry Mike & Ike's be removed from her candy dish along with strict instructions that any room she walks into should have seven packs of cigarettes waiting for her three of them opened, that there be a personal jacuzzi within eighty paces of her dressing room, and that any time she travels, her nanny must fly with her first class.
Elaine, she doesn't have any children!  Don't you see?  We're being held hostage by 12 men and 5 women who someone somewhere has decreed are the A-list.
Well, I do remember why I started out in this business -- you seem to have forgotten -- working in New York with Cassevetes -- we were trying to do something important, shine a light in that darkened cinema --
I don't know if that's going to happen.
As I say, she's... something of a recluse.  That's how she's able to stay so pure -- by isolating herself in her art.
No need.  She does all her own stunts.
Soon.  Soon.
Everyone you know is lying.
Elaine, what are you doing tonight? Would you like to go somewhere -- dinner?
Oh, yes.  Of course.  Don't I always?
No.
Do what?
That sounds wonderful.  How do you feel about all this, Lainey?
No... it's life.
Of course.
I do find myself physically attracted to you, Mr. Taransky.
Please put your clothes on
I just think actors talk too much. Does the world really want to hear your life story just because you've got a movie opening Friday?
You don't secretly want the attention?
What exactly was it that attracted you to your first two projects?
Frank, you know as well as I do, living in a fish bowl, the insatiable appetite of the media...
You never were together, Hal.
Clyde.
How did the wall get there?
-- Please, get away from me.
I was misquoted.
That's right.  You were booed off the stage.  That's got to be -- ?
We've been seeing each other, sure, but we'd rather keep our relationship private.
Hello, Lainey.
I know plenty of boys.
I read.
If anyone asks about Simone --
I know, Hal is as stiff as always.
Precisely.
I'll see what I can do.  You know, Lainey.  I don't believe you've ever once asked to meet Simone.  Don't you like her?
I could get the death penalty.
I didn't kill anyone, Bernard, there was no one to kill!
Max Sayer -- National Echo.
Who's the hostage, Sayer, her or you?  You look kind of "captive" yourself.  While you're spending every waking hour obsessing over Simone, guess what, I guarantee she doesn't even know you exist.  Get off my property or I'll call the cops.
I'm just trying to help you, Sayer. I don't want you to be disappointed.  It gets cold out here at night.
It's a yacht.
Er,... good.
She looks a lot like you.
Obviously the name isn't real -- she's using an assumed identity, travels under a false name, checks into hotels with an alias.  She never stays in the same place two nights in a row.  Anything on the satellite photos?  What about the fingerprints?  What happened when we dusted that hotel suite?
Yes, I'd like that.
Let it burn.  Simone would rather go up in flames than give up her privacy.
-- What you don't understand --
Buy it?  They're paying for it. And around here that's how you really know they buy it.
Yes.  Yes, it is.
You're right.  You're right.  Of course, one doesn't want to boast. It's a classic case of technology in search of an artist.  That's all you've been waiting for, an artist with integrity, with a vision, who can see.
What, Anna? What did I do? What's made you so sad?
I didn't leave you.
...De profundis clamo ad te domine.
If it's okay with you?
You saw that on T.V., Cole?
See, this is why I lose at poker. Yes, I do have a question.
He your best buddy?
That I'm a freak.
Yeah. Sorry.
What about Mrs. Marschal?
You haven't told bedtime stories before?
You have to add some twists and stuff. Maybe they run out of gas.
It means I wasn't what everyone thought I was...  I was a fake.
Yes.
Maybe they wake up that morning thinking they have a thousand things to do and a thousand days left to do them in... And then all of a sudden, it's all taken away. No one asked them. It's just gone...
No.
I don't think that's the way it works, Cole.
Really?
What?
Oh.
You'd cry. Cause you miss grandma so much.
Yes.
Cole, please stop.
Stop looking at me.
J. C. Penny's?
What's a "little while?"
I ain't never played a banjo in my life.
Keep your shirt on! I'm almost done!
Not according to these.
Not lately.
Find out what's holding things up. I want to get the hell off this farm.
Hell, no. But you missed a damn good sermon. "You can't hide a wicked heart from the eyes of the Lord."
Book of Jeremiah.
Easy. Gunshot. Patricide. Next.
Yeah. Marvin's old man gunned him down.
All right. "Fratricide". Minor technical detail.
Shotgun. Suicide. Next?
Nah. We still got Billy Bob.
"And a slash-slash there --"
Joseph Macdonald. Damn right, boy. And don't you forget it.
Broke her heart you never visited... But I always said you'd come back.
I'll be fine here.
She was talking about... a "harvest of blood"...
That's a good idea. Maybe we should have a little "talk" about grandaddy Jethro.
What's wrong?
Ray -- I'd like to get to the club sometime before dawn.
He started it.
Bzzzzzzzzzt!
Yeah. Sure. I'm screwing up the song. You're the one who's been two beats behind since we kicked it off.
Which means we've got ONE week to start acting like a professional band.
Yeah, that's right! I'm outta here -- Y'all can kiss my city ass goodbye!... I'm gone with the wind.
Then why go back now?
Let it go.
Look. You want to talk about this?
Mmmm -- so can I...
You never had trouble communicating before.
Can't help it, Suze... family sticks together...
Yeah, I'll teach you a lesson --
What a surprise. -- What about our audition?
It's coming right up. After the third verse.
Why bother?
What'll we do?
Bill, we need to talk!
I'll tell you what, no one with lyme disease gonna win any damn handsome contests!
Just checking out the lights.
Oh, yeah?
Okay.
That's the mystery of the ages there, Trev. Starla was seventeen when they got engaged. He was, like, in his thirties. No one even knew they were goin' out till she had that ring on her finger.
We're coming your way, man!
Oh yeah. Fuck you, fat ass.
Your momma wasn't too proud when you came out neither, Wally.
Shelby, shut up. Keep an eye out for these things. If you see 'em, keep your mouth covered. Otherwise they'll go straight down it. All right?
Brought you munchies.
Howdy, Mr. Grant. You goin' to the Deer Cheer this weekend?
What can I do you for?
Work thing hell, Starla. He just wants to get in your pussy. Him and most these other ones around here. That's where their minds is at, them sick fucks.
That's disrespectful.
You're pretty.
Grant, you're sick!
And you said the worms are part of him. They're all linked, like one creature?
We ain't never gonna find that girl now.
'Praise Jesus?' That's fucking pushing it, Margaret.
Margaret.
Your what?
If...?
What's the matter? Legend has it Bandit LaRue's king of the road.
Whaddya want to know? My sign?
Yeah, I do. Especially from that angle.
We're cool. The dumb schmuck took the wrong turn.
Believe me, there's nothing to be afraid of.
Ciao.
Nice meeting you, Cledus. Keep on truckin'.
Do I know? I'm an authority on it.
You plan on driving trucks all your life?
Yeah?
Forget it. This is one of the longest relationships I've ever had. I'm not blowing it now.
And?
Well, that's what you get for falling in love with a guy who's first name is Ramblin'.
Sleep for a week.  Wanna join me?
Another time.
No one's ever done it before. This'll put us on the map.
Because they said it couldn't be done.
Save it. We got a long haul.
Not for long, you ain't.
On its way. Give me a coupla minutes, okay?
I'm cucumber cool.
What's that, pardner?
Go breaker.
Pick it up, Breaker.
What's up, Dixie Chicken?
Seventy-two five.  Why do you want this barley pop so bad?
I don't know where he's goin' or what he's doin', but I sure hope to God he makes it.
Yes, ma'am.
Well, we were worried about dust and debris from the work being done ruining the cameras, so--
Of course. Yes.
And a very bad gamble.
Welcome to the new Bureau. Nobody shares information anymore, it's become synonymous with job security.
That's happening in about ten minutes. Israel's at optimum risk of flight right now, so we can't wait.
Have them mobilized. I'll phone security and have the elevators locked down and stairwells secured. We need to keep Israel sequestered in that penthouse.
Yeah. Have you been able to get through to the Nomad's security?
Mortal.
Yeah.
-- he was wearing one of our jackets.
Yeah, he had the badge and everything. It said "FBI" on it.
And threw us into the lake.
Yeah, m'brothers... They didn't make it.
I'm glad I'm here. I love it. I'm gonna get laid by some fine ass angels and then go hang out with Jesus and them.
Won't work, we're just gonna have to chance it man. I'm sorry.
The Teamsters had a reform measure going to ballot that didn't sit too well with the local syndicate. Night of the polling, big black-tie to-do downtown and the Tremor Brothers crash the party. Literally.
Look at that, we didn't have to fill up the whole blackboard after all. Now, do you know anything about that?
Cinnamon roll? No, good guess though. No, Hugo that looks like jizz...  And I'm no forensic expert mind you, but that looks like some fuckhead shot their load on a twelve-thousand dollar calf's skin jacket. The twist? It's My twelve thousand dollar, calf's skin jacket.  So y'got semen, human ejaculate --  -- that's been allowed to soak in for what, six, seven hours now? Work it's way into the fabric-fuck'n fibers -- and while you may never see it in a Tide commercial, I think it still safely qualifies as a "tough, deep down stain."
...See, this is one'a them rare moments when y'ass get a chance to be completely honest... and if I'm asking you what you said to Mecklen, assume the shit is rhetorical... so assume I already know.
-- this isn't a swap meet Morrey, they're getting Sparazza and the west coast syndicate, giftwrapped, now if that's not good enough --
I thought Heller was a double op?
Sparazza was the one who introduced Israel to the life, gave him his first big break, brought him through the ranks.
-- Your intel corroborates what we already know. Sparazza's health is in rapid decline and before his date with destiny, it seems he wants one last thing... The heart of his sworn enemy. A recently opened, cash rich escrow account has been traced back to Sparazza. This and the mention of this mysterious Swede makes the million dollar contract on Israel very real.
-- You can and you will.
...Almost.  What do you mean "who Sparazza actually was..."
It wasn't elective. It was undertaken to save his life. And it wasn't cosmetic, it was reconstructive... Look at the date of the first procedure.
The same year that Sparazza murdered Agent Freeman Heller...
No... It's not.  What it lacks... is an end.
I'm here.
-- who can say. He's off his onion, y'know, he's old school Sicilian, this is how they hate.
Yeah, I can front this.
None whatsoever.
You do the right thing. Sit with me while I heal, let it develop slow.
'Spose to kill this fool named Buddy Israel.
I ain't tryin' to break a sweat for that sorry ass nigga.
I ain't even goin' dignify that. You my road dog. We threw up sets.  Plus you stank.
Not you. Some assholes on the elevator... are these bitches on a permanent smoke break or what? Why the fuck they call'm "working girls."
What's the time frame?
You're not Gibarian...
All right.
Not her.  It.
Whose side are you on?
What?
He'll let me in.
Why, who did you see?
Oh, that's a relief.
How much sleep?
But why is it doing what it's doing? Given it's resources, it could have done anything.  Presented me with your double, and you with mine.
That's right.  And we all have to sleep, eventually.
Get out --
Her oxygen would have run out.
Why?
Stop it.
I am.  Please come with me.  I don't want to do this here.
What do you mean?
Yes.  But not until you mentioned them.  As soon as you said those things, I remembered them.  And they have associations that make me think of other things I remember.  It's like filling up.
It's something.
How old were you?
It's genetics.  You know this.  You know where it comes from.  There is nothing wrong with uncrossing a few crossed wires.
I think so.
Snow thinks we shouldn't leave until we figure out a way to document it, to prove its existence to the planet Earth.  This is hilarious: He thinks it's God, but he wants it to sit still for a photograph so he can show the folks back home.
He does have a point.  That's just not the way I'd like to see it proven.
You don't love me.
You're lying.  I'm not human.
Neither did I.
You exist here.  I keep telling you.
They do something to me.  It's hard to think straight.
Why do you say that?
It's an experiment.
I'm not Snow.
Hello, Win.
It's called "solid"... Nice to find someone you can count on, Win.
Oh... Yes... I don't have it with me.  It's at home.
He thinks you're being a little careless.  He made the point several times.
No, Ma'am.
I'll come with you.
Yeah.
Hmm...
Nope... never finished one yet.  I hate these things.
No, no seriously!  There's a study done on this, you walk this way, the muggers are gonna single you out.
I'll miss you, Mike...
Claire...!
Let go!
They called here after you left...
Not exactly.
Pretty bad.
"To"... Forget about you.
It was something my father always liked me to do.
Claire...
Get in bed.
Not great.  I've got a babysitting job for a material witness on a homicide.
I can still use a gun.
I think television's a dangerous thing.
I don't know that Ellie.  He might get out.  Garber's not bein' straight with the witness, she could be in deep shit if she identifies him, and it's my job to convince her she won't be.
She didn't like the other one, so she picked this one.
She bought it.
Did you hear what I said?!!
I'm sorry.
You talked to his wife?
Anyone who turns himself in makes a good case for bail.
If she identifies him.  Where the fuck were you anyway, cowboy!  Venza was meat.  He walked right past you, and now we're the ones playing catch-up!  You better hope she identifies him.
It should've been me...
Do it, or look for another profession.  That's a choice I guess.
Erect.  You know, a "boner?"  I'd heard that it gives you a boner, to shoot a man.
Koontz!  Let her come in!  Claire! It's pitch dark in here!  You're gonna have trouble seeing anything, so just come in, and straight down a long hall.  Then stand at the door so we can see you. We want to see your face and we won't be able to until you get to the kitchen door!
Yeah, I think so.
Mom and I got plans.
She's taking singing lessons.
Shooting?
Oh, beware of jealousy, my lord, the green-eyed monster...
At least this ensemble doesn't glow in the dark.
Let me see.
Same old stuff.  How's the pharmacy?
See?
I saw him too.  He was silly and obnoxious.
Come on, laughter's the best medicine!
A little bunny I saved from dissection.
I know.  I've got one too.
Why home? The real world beckons, man!  The possibilities are endless.  Want to go up to the World Trade Center and laugh at New Jersey?
Don't be pitiful.
Listen, I do appreciate your concern, but--
Well, I've missed a lot of classes myself...
Parker-- you go here, right?  Got your camera?
Gimme that.  Pick it up later.
You print pictures of Bigfoot!
Can I get a word in edgewise?
I don't submit to blackmail!  The first amendment protects my freedom to tell the news as I imagine it, and--
Uh-huh. Look, this should be skintight.  Bright colors.  Red, maybe a deep midnight blue.
A spider.  Eight legs.
Deal.  But don't tell anyone.  I want to keep a low profile.
Thanks, I already ate.
Well...
Just about.  See, I also have this amazing strength.
Even if they're not clever.
I hate your relatives, I hate your coffee, I hate your shoes.
Thank God.
You're not trained for that.  None of us are... I mean, sometimes I...  Okay, let's say you had gone back. What then?  Are you bulletproof?
So you've found Thorkel?
Precise equipment such as waldos
Oh, Peter. A zit.
Ick.  And those foul chemicals in the pots--
It's fine.  Tell me what--
Power down.  I need to talk to you.
This is the unified field!  All the forces of the universe tied together-- perfectly!
I will finish what I've begun
Rosomoff, I have better things to do than teach Introductory Physics to mindless adolescents.
An extension on that astronomy paper?  Because, uh...
Yup.  Oh, here's your check, minus my commission.  Solid, solid novelty act.
What?
No.  No, I-- my aunt and uncle. Something's wrong  --  I need to make a phone call.
Yeah, just a lung full of New Jersey.  Lucky you showed up when you did.
Just drop me off here.
Phooey on that.
Any news on Dunbar?
Don't worry. He'll be all right.
I don't know anymore.
So long, Sefton.
A lot sharper, Sefton! I'd like to have some of that loot you got in those footlockers!
You stink, Sefton!
Maybe it's going to be a longer war than you figured -- eh, Duke?
Ask Security.  You tell him, Price. You've got me shadowed every minute of the day. Or haven't you found out yet?
Okay, Security -- what happened?
Only he ain't quite finished yet. Blondie -- get that smudge pot. Tie it to Steve's leg.
Tipping me off? I do not understand.
Which one of you is what?
Yes, it would. Do we know each other?
My legs are frozen.
Not you.
Let's!
No bother. I'm very grateful for a little company. You see, I suffer from insomnia.
I want to sleep. Give me five minutes on that couch.
Oh, come now! You threw a time bomb.
I want to talk about Lieutenant Dunbar. Is this Lieutenant Dunbar?
What exactly is he charged with?
Isn't it?
Say, Schulz --
Some are not bad at all.
What's the award?
Me? What if she don't want me?
It's beautiful!  You goin' to eat it all yourself?
He don't have to worry. He'll trade the Krauts for a six-burner gas range. Maybe a deep freeze too.
He's the grrrrreatest!
It's not good for you, Animal.
So it is from the finance company. So it's better than no letter at all. So they want the third payment on the Plymouth.  So they want the fourth, the fifth, the sixth and the seventh. So they want the Plymouth.
You hold him. I'll slug him.
Hey, here's Esther Williams.
Animal! Got a little something for you!
Hey, Animal! Animal!
This is me, Animal! It's Harry Shapiro!
Yes, Sergeant Hoffman?
Wait a second, Hoffy. Schulz says he's our best friend. Maybe he can give us a little hint.
Maybe it's crazy, but it's better than having Dunbar dead.
Lay off, Schulz. He's got a sickness. He's krank.
Yeah? How would you like to see the guts of nine pals splattered all over your plane?  C'mon Joey -- don't be afraid.
One more thing, gentlemen. The Kommandant told me to pick up the radio.
Sure I heard it. I still got one good ear.
You starting that again?
I called it the last time, didn't I?
You betcha. There ought to be some reward money from Mama. Say ten thousand bucks worth.
Just one little thing. How come you were so sure Manfredi and Johnson wouldn't get out of the forest?
Yes, I'm from Cleveland.
Where. Up Joey's ocarina. Didn't you know?
You are trying to say that an American would inform on other Americans?
All right, gentlemen, I will find it myself. Now let's see.
Ganz einfach... Streichhoelzer... und eine Zigarette...
Who's the guy, Schulz?
No! No!
Russian women prisoners?
Oh! Somebody was peeking!
Where is he?
Full disruptors.
When is it expected back?
Wait. The Bozeman,why did it change course?
Commander.
I believe the emotional chip has overloaded my positronic relays.
I am quite...preoccupied with concern about Geordi.
Perhaps.  Yes! If we sent a low-level ionic pulse, it might reset the coil and engage the cloaking systems.
For you. This is where you wanted to be.
When the Enterprise-B beamed us off the Lakul, we were partially in the Nexus. The transporters locked on to us, but somehow everyone left a part of themselves behind.
Why would you want to leave?
Oh, of course.
Least I could do for a captain of the Enterprise.
It's like you always said- if something's important enough, you make the time.
Load torpedo bays, prepare to fire on my command.
I always do.
Make it so.
You want me to contact Starfleet?
Understood. That will be all.
What I can't get out of my mind is the image of Rene- my nephew. I just can't believe he's gone.
My brother had shouldered that burden, allowing me to pursue my own selfish needs.
Thank you.
Well, that narrows it to Klingon, Breen or Romulan.
He has been here for some time. I can feel his presence.
Yes, sir, I sealed the room myself. Nevertheless -- I am reading a life form there.
I can't get an answer. Starfleet is up to its brass in galactic conference. No one has time for those who only stand... and wait.
Keep trying, Chekov. At regular intervals.
What did you see, Chekov?
Short range scan, Mr. Chekov... On screen, Mr. Sulu.
It has to be. Gravitational fields were in flux... It must have soft landed...!
What is it?
Oh no you don't! Regulations specifically state: "nothing shall be beamed aboard until danger of contamination has been eliminated." Can you guarantee that?
David... Sorry I'm late.
Sector three... Sub-tropical vegetation... Temperature --  Temperature decreasing rapidly --
You must be very proud of what you and your mother have created.
We're not here to investigate geological aging, we're here to find life forms!
But... How could they have evolved so quickly...?
Spock's burial robe.
I'll go...
I'll try to remember that, Captain.
Yes, Saavik, go ahead...
Your timing is excellent, Mr. Scott. You've fixed the barn door after the horse has come home. How much refit time till we can take her out again?
I'm sorry, sir, but as far as I'm concerned, there's nothin' needed for space travel that this old girl doesn't already have.
Thank you, Mr. Scott. I'll try not to take that personally.  My friends... I can't ask you to go any further. Dr. McCoy and I have to do this. The rest of you do not.
I'd be grateful, Admiral, if you'd give the word.
Oh, God, sir, I dinna think so...
He gave his life to save us. That is all I know.
What? What are you saying?
Much is at stake...
The ship... Out of danger...?
She's to be decommissioned.
The word is no.  I am therefore going anyway.
I'll need it, Sulu.
FULL IMPULSE POWER!
Go, Sulu!
My friends, the great experiment: Excelsior, ready for trial runs...
Indisposed, sir.
Jim, the Enterprise is twenty years old. We think her day is over...
As surely as if it were my own!  Harry, give me back the Enterprise! With Scotty's help...
You should take the Vulcan, too.
Beam the Vulcan up -- And we talk.
You missed the point, then and now... Only his body was "in death," Kirk! And you were the last one to be with him.
You must bring them to Mount Selaya -- on Vulcan. Only there is the passage possible. Only there can both find peace...
You will find a way, Kirk. If you honor them both, you <U>must</U>.
Understood, my lord.
Steady. Continue on impulse power.
Wait!... Wait...
Killing his son was <U>stupid</U>! It made Kirk willing to die.
All true.
I am going to do nothing about it. <u>You</u> are going to sit in the closet.
Takes the stuff a while to ferment. Gimme.
Exactly. Happy birthday.
Spare me your notions of poetry, please. We all have our assigned duties and...
I'm your doctor and I'm your friend, Jim. Get back your command. Get it back before you really do grow old. Before you turn into part of this collection.
At the moment that question takes a back seat to preventing him from laying his hands on it. You said it yourself; we're talking about a bang that would re-arrange the universe...
It's like the Garden of Eden...
And almost got tossed out of the Academy...
Young. I feel young, Doctor.
We have received new orders. Upon our arrival at Regula I, all materials of Project Genesis will be transferred to this ship for immediate testing at Ceti Alpha VI.
What order? Who's taking Genesis?
Is that a poem?
And bored. I know. But maybe it IS something they can...
Thanks a lot. No respect from my offspring --
But we can't just sit here -- !
You know what she'll say...
Ssssh!
We appear to have plenty of time.
What?
That makes two of us.  Lieutenant Saavik was right: you never have faced death --
You knew enough to tell Saavik that how we face death is at least as important as how we face life --
But good words. That's where ideas begin. Maybe you should listen to them.
Is that what you came here to say?
The Admiral's son.
Warp drive still inoperative. All other systems should be restored shortly.
Inoperative.
Admiral --
I had me a wee bout -- but Dr. McCoy pulled me through.
Give the word, Admiral.
Admiral, this is Spock.
Engine room reports auxiliary power restored. We can proceed at impulse power.
Admiral, if we go by the book, like Lieutenant Saavik, hours could seem like days.
Oh do you? Have you any idea, Midshipman Preston, how many times I've had to listen to Mr. Scott on the Comm, telling me his troubles? Have you any idea the ribbing I've had to endure in the officers' mess to the effect that the Enterprise is a flying death trap?
The word is given: warp speed.
I am understandably curious.
'It was the best of times, it was the worst of times...' Message, Spock?
The Enterprise. I must check in before your inspection. And you?
To be sure, Captain.
That is wise. In any case, were I to invoke logic, logic clearly dictates that the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few.
Give up Genesis, she said. What in God's name does that mean? Give it up to whom?
And no way of knowing if Reliant is still in the area...
... Blind as a Tiberian Bat. What do you make of the plantoid beyond?
Engine room... Scotty, do we have enough power for the transporters?
He won't break off now. If he followed me this far he'll be back. But from where...?
Or the one.
I don't believe this was a fair test of my command capabilities.
... No, sir. It has not.
Energize defense fields.
HURRY.
There is no such regulation.
Phasers on stun. Move out.
Two minutes, ten seconds.
Three minutes, thirty seconds.
Good, I believe you already know my, uh, son --
Project parabolic course to avoid entering Neutral Zone.
Inform the Klingons we are on a rescue mission...
I'll try, Captain.
Aft thrusters, sir.
Ready, sir.
Honors -- hup!
Thank you, Mr. Saavik.
Aye, sir.
Lieutenant, the Admiral is aware of the Regulations.
Where must you go?
Then you stand here alive because of a mistake -- made by your flawed, feeling, human friends. They have sacrificed their futures because they believed that the good of the <u>one</u> -- you -- was more important to them.
I tried to clear things up, Professor Scott. I explained you'd come all the way from Edinburgh on appointment to study manufacturing methods here at Plexico, but they don't seem to know anything about it.
Would you prefer to do nothing?
What do you think, Spock?
Come on, Pavel...
... My shoes...
Pardon me, Doctor, I am hearing many calls of distress.
How do you explain slowing pulse, low respiratory rate and coma?
My God, man, drilling holes in his head is not the answer. The artery must be repaired without delay or he will die! So put away your butcher knives and let me save the patient!
Captain... All systems have failed... We are functioning on reserve power only.
It gives me a great sense of danger. We have to beam in next to the reactor room, not in it.
All right. Let's take it from the top.
No, <u>my</u> name.
I'm impressed, Mr. Chekov. A lot of effort for a short voyage.
Most prudent.  Engine room. Report, Scotty.
And Admiral, it's the Enterprise.
Mr. President, the Probe has passed through all quadrants. The starships Shepard and Yorktown and three smaller vessels have been neutralized.
We don't know. It's using forms of energy our best scientists do not understand...
Communicate? Communicate what? You have no right to be here!
I was not.
Is there something wrong with the one I have?
I buy that. What about him?
You've already been that. C'mon.
What does that mean, exactly? Take their chances.
They'll be flown in a special 747 to Alaska and released there.
You? You can't even get from Sausalito to San Francisco without a lift.
If you have such a low opinion of my abilities, how come we're having dinner?
It's not so much a matter of a place as of time.
That's what you think.  Okay...Truth... I'm from what, on your calendar, would be the late 23rd Century. I've been sent back in time to bring two Humpback Whales with me in an attempt to... repopulate the species.
You asked.  Now, will you tell me something?  George and Gracie's transmitter. What's the frequency?
It wouldn't be my first choice, no.
Yes... If you have a chart on board, I can show you.
What are you talking about? I'm coming with you.
All right. The frequency is 401 megahertz.
Surely you can be more specific...
You've programmed that from memory...?
Simple logic will suffice. We need a map.  That one should do.
How do you know this...?
Yes.
Ah... The giants.
The tank will be finished by morning...
Admiral, you must wait one damn minute.
Mr. Scott cannot give me exact figures, Admiral. So I will...  Make a <u>guess</u>.
We'll divide into teams. Commanders Chekov and Uhura are assigned to the Uranium problem.
Ground cushion! Keep the nose up if you can --
Communications Systems ready. Communications Officer -- ready as she'll ever be.
On speakers.
From a city? That doesn't make sense....
Mr. Scott -- how soon?
Give me one more day, sir. The damage control is easy. Reading Klingon is hard.
I suppose I can, sir; are you planning to take a swim?
Mr. Sulu?
Don't concern yourself, Saavik. Your leave has been granted for good and proper cause.  How are you feeling?
Vulcans are well known as the intellectual puppets of the Federation!
Well, that's different.
Just use the keyboard...
Gomen nasarei. Hito chigai de gozaranuka na.  I'm sorry, my son. You have mis- taken me for someone else.
To move you off this planet. You go to sleep one night in your village... wake up the next morning in this flying holodeck transported en masse. A week later, maybe a month, you've been relocated on a similar planet without ever realizing it.
We've always known that to survive, we had to remain apart. It hasn't been easy. Many of the young people here want to know more about the offland... they're attracted to stories of a faster pace of life...
Yes. Exactly. Nothing more complicated than perception.  You explore the universe. We've discovered a single moment in time can be a universe in itself... full of powerful forces... most people aren't aware enough of the now... to ever notice them...
I just... haven't gotten around to it yet.
Roughly translated: puberty... although for a Klingon that's not doing it justice...  Any severe mood swings, unusual aggressive tendencies -- be sure to let me know right away...
I'll be here.
You're what?
I understand.
Really?
For what purpose?
Androids... don't have...fun.
Bye.
Are they in any danger?
Your Captain used to cut quite a rug...
Captain, Geordi...?
From the mission...
How about a passive radiation scan?
I know what Data means to Starfleet, Jean-Luc... but our crew is at the mercy of those people on the planet...
Talk... we should send down an assault team and take them by force.
It is not over.
That's probably not a good idea. Your ship hasn't been fitted for this region; there are environmental concerns...
We haven't fully identified the anomalies yet. They're calling this whole area The Briar Patch... it took us a day to reach a location where we could get a signal out to you. Just get me Data's schematics. I'll keep you informed.  Dougherty out.
This was too important for the Enterprise to be on the sidelines, Admiral...
I'll need all your paperwork tomorrow. We're heading back your way. Set a course to rendezvous with us so you can transfer the crew and equipment on your way out.
Your "Briar Patch" turned out to be more hospitable than I expected.
A planet in Federation space...
Is this how a Federation officer begs for his life?
Scan for lifesigns.
Do you have everything you need from command?
The manifold can't handle full impulse in the Patch, Commander.
Commander, if one of their weapons hits that gas...
We're through running from these bastards.
Deck ten.
Ask them.
We're coming as fast as we can... we can't risk using phasers...
Worf, what the hell are you doing here?
No, sir...
What are they interested in...?
Hmm, I should feel right at home with them...
Was I doing something to your neck?
On this ship, anything can happen. And usually does.
Activating injector assembly.
It's been destroyed. The Borg threat is over.  Are you all right? The Enterprise disappeared from our sensors for a moment.
Montana? Well, that answers everything. Why the hell are we --
I've stabilized him for now... but he's in a coma and he's going to need radiometric therapy. I want to take him to the ship.
Let's hope so. Because if Cochrane dies... the future may die with him.
How did Doctor Almack react to that?
Not yet.
They're not your friends... they've held you back... kept you from your destiny...
I wish to... go back to the way I was.
A universe of sensation is waiting for you... don't you want to explore it... with me?
Yes... but the Enterprise... my duty...
Go to impulse. Where's the Borg ship?
What?
I am the beginning... the end. I am the one who is many. I am the Borg.
It'll have to wait. Come on.
Then we'll just have to assume it's still there...
There's a red light on the second intake valve.
I'm on it...
Speed -- two hundred, seventy-five thousand kilometers per second.
We're crossing the threshold!
Ready.
Great name. French?
Oh... here and there. You know how it is.
There's a few of us left.
I think he was running a test on an old rocket engine... and one of the fuel cells burst.
The invasion plans.
Wrong answer, Mister Picard. Try again.
Ah... yes... but, I didn't realize that --
Trade. Okay. The photographs... for a straight answer.  Who are you? And how do you know Zephram?
I have to...
That's impossible.
Aye, sir.
On screen.
Population... thirty-five billion...  All Borg.
Data, set a course for that vortex.
Fire!
Onscreen.
We're still in Earth orbit.
Normally, I would agree. But in this case, the mission requires a certain knowledge of 21st century history. You're many things, Number One, but you're not much of an historian.
It appears that someone has taken over the Environmental Control Room.
We have to cover both possibilities.  We'll take care of the Bridge. Worf, take your men and seal off Main Engineering. Turn it into a fortress -- nothing gets in.
They appear to be modifying the deflector dish.
They're converting the deflector dish into an antennae...
Right.
Nothing.
We just lost main power... and we've got Class-Three alerts all over the ship. I'm not sure what's --
The Borg.  Some of them must've beamed over before we destroyed their ship.  Seal off that entire deck with emergency force fields.
Mister Worf... find Data if you can, but your top priority is isolating the Borg.
What are you suggesting?
I'm going too. They may need a doctor.
The charge is murder.
We DO sleep lying down.
We WERE beginning to hit our stride together, doctor...
We're not finished.
Uh uh. Somebody felt much worse. And I'm starting to understand why.
No way.  You see this?
In space, no one can hear you sweat.
Stand...?
Barely.
The Chancellor herself will testify that the defendant's hands shook.
Isn't it a fact that you served Romulan ale, a beverage illegal in the Federation because of its overwhelming potency?
That isn't true...!
I cannot confirm or deny actions which I did not witness.
First rule of assassination: always kill the assassins.
They must have walked through it when it was floating and tracked it back here.
Uh, would you and your party care to dine this evening aboard Enterprise with my officers as guests of the United Federation of Planets?
They'll be here...
Kill him! He's the one!!
He's got it.
There's gotta be a way out of this place...
Except us.
Aye, sir.
Only don't try putting words in my mouth.
I won't allow Starfleet to be dismantled over some Klingon promises.
Congratulations, Lieutenant. That must make you very proud...
The Chancellor is undoubtedly awaiting our signal.
Curiously it appears to emanate from us.
We've fired on the Chancellor's ship -
I'M going. You are going to be responsible for getting me out of this. Meantime we're not going to be the instigators of a full-scale war on the eve of universal peace.
So, that's it..
Someone said the difference between comic and cosmic is the letter "S." You haven't outlived your usefulness - to me. And you are not responsible just because she is also Vulcan -
I do not think so. Enterprise has disobeyed orders and harbors two escaped convicts. Admiral Donald will make certain all your ship-to- shore transmissions are jammed.
What?
Signal Starfleet that... we have no idea location of Enterprise.
I think  not.
We'll have to check every one of them, Mr. Scott.
Nevertheless.
Then someone forged a data bank entry.
If another ship had been beneath us the Klingons would've seen her!
This one can.
Yes, sir.
Even assuming you're correct, Mr. Spock, why would they fire on their own President?
Mr. Scott, any progress on repairing our warp drive?
You have been programmed to gather information that can be used against this ship.
Understood. Keep on it. I need to know what he has and how to neutralize any threat. Give me options.
He was a bit proud as I recall.
I wish I could believe that, Doctor.
Dying?
I'm counting on it... We've been ordered to head to sector 3274. Starfleet is diverting the fleet to meet us there.
Well... it seems we're truly sailing into the unknown. Keep at it. Anything you can give me would be appreciated. Dismissed.
Port thrusters, sir. Would you like me to drive?
At our current velocity we will arrive at sector 3274 in approximately 40 minutes.
Of you?
It's interfering with our uplink from Starfleet cartography?
Full axis rotation to port! Fire all ventral phasers!
Divert power and compensate.
I can't believe the Captain went along with a memory download.
Don't give up hope, Data. I know, I know, you're not capable of hope.

You're speaking of emotional investment?
Permission denied. If you can possibly endure any more of these assaults.  I need you at my side. Now more than ever I...
This isn't about me anymore.
This isn't real.
Your timing is impeccable, Commander.
Do you have life support?
What programs were accessed?
Which is why our initial scans didn't pick it up. But he's got it, Captain.
Sir?
Just lucky, Admiral.
Praetor Shinzon, I'm pleased to...
What are you doing to Counsellor Troi?
Wont do what, Mister Worf?
Your new chair, sir.
I appreciate your concern, Number One, but I've been itching to try out the Argo.
Acknowledged ...  ...I'll talk to Data.
A coup d'etat?
She's a predator.
His hatred of the Federation is apparent. He would have built a weapon of that scope for one reason. He is going after Earth.
I promise you in time, she'll become your home ...If I could offer you one piece of advice?
Praetor Shinzon?
I would be interested to know what we are talking about.
And the Senate supports you?
Not quite. I envy the hair- line.
No. I was the first Picard to leave Earth.  It caused quite a stir, In fact. But I had spent my whole life...
I see a young man trying desperately to deny who he is.
Please.
But, Praetor, you won't survive without him...
Yes, Praetor.
Do as I tell you!
A matter of hours now.
Seven minutes.
She is here.
They're holding position.
None.
You don't have to understand.
Silence, Romulan!
Praetor.
And mine is wearing thin, young man! We supported you because you promised action. And yet you delay and you waste your time playing games with Picard while--
For the moment.
I don't want to scare them away.
No, we can handle this.
I don't think so... 
How much are your rooms?
I make maps.
No.
Thank you.
Elmo's...
They must have picked it up in space.
There's no mistake? You're absolutely sure?
Get the body out of there. Load it on the Air Force chopper and get it to Wright Patterson. They'll take it from there... We didn't expect this, Shermin.
It's taken on a disguise.
You're not hearing me.
This is George Fox...
I told you. He let me go. I'm on my way home.
Do you know what you were kidnapped by?
Don't... don't do this... please...
Steering wheel.
Eh... police.
X...
Smile.
No gas.
Space?
Shit?
Shit... shit... what shit?
A baby is a new person?
Why?
Why?
'Salt Lake City, please. I do not speak English.'
I do not speak English.
Goodbye.
Yes?
It was a mistake.
I understand.
He will.
Why?
I've noticed... Do you understand what they're saying?
Yes. Sing some more.
The police know about Lathrop Wells. We have to go another way. Come on.
Come on.
You can stop. I will go on alone.
Horses.
I understand.
Yes, they are.
I told you it's impossible for me to have a baby.
Many of my people will not believe those things are possible. On my planet there is only one government, one people, one language. I will be asked a lot of questions.
I will say that we can be friends.
If you want to keep it, you can.
You want the baby to laugh at me.
Oh, wow... I'll tell you what. When the baby is born, we'll go out in my back yard and wave to you.
I must go.
I'm never going to see you again, am I?
I will.
He doesn't understand... just walk away...
Geez, Mrs. Haydn, we just got going.
If he didn't want to go through the roadblock, is there any other way to get to Vegas?
It's easier not to tell if you don't know.
I wouldn't worry about it... There might not be any little league tomorrow.
Bell wants us to get down on our knees and bow.
Doesn't make sense.
You jerk! You look at all the sweetness and light and goodness you think'll come out of this. You know what's gonna come out of this... The end of religion, the end of civilization, the end of the earth. We could become slaves, we could become a colony of these things. Don't you see that? Are you too stupid to see that?
Wait'll you see it.
Scott Haydn is dead. He died about three months ago. We went to the funeral.
You saw that?
Yeah, right.
Joey, make sure Mr. Nero gets safely to his car.
You're too goddamned paranoid.
What're you going to do?
Watch and see.
Too bad about your guy Jeriko. Tough break.
I just got to talk to you for one second.
No, Lenny.
I know.  Lenny, if Tran finds you talking to me he'll hurt you.
Why don't you just split?  You don't love him, anybody can see that.  And to him you're just some kinda possession, like a Ferrari, something to show the other guys.
Max Pelcher?  You're kidding?
Don't know.  But this guy's real damaged goods.  Iris knew someone was after her... and she said you were in danger too.  Now no more games, Faith.  Whatever you're hiding, whatever's going on, you have to get out of here now. Come with me right now.  Don't even think about it.
Tell me.
A virgin brain!  Well we're going to start you off right.  So what do you know about this?  Save us some time...
I'll set you up, get you a deck at my cost... since my thing is the software.
Listen, before we get into numbers, I want you to try a taste.  I got a deck with me.
This tie cost more than your entire wardrobe.
Yup.  So darn lucky.  I wake up with a .22-short floating in my brainpan, and a cop pension I can't live off of.  Good thing I wasn't any luckier.  Bobby!  Another shooter right here!
I figured, what the hell, I could take the prick's money and make sure Faith was OK at the same time.  Do us both good.  Right?
W'sup, Max?
Yeah.  She's leaving with Tran so I got to boogie.  Real quick... Iris checked into the Sheraton last night under a false name.  Paid cash.
You may be a little overdressed for this party.  Yo, Tick!  It's Lenny.  Open up!
Yeah.  So don't walk near me in public, alright.
What do you mean?
This is what we laughingly refer to as a plan, right?
I intend to.
This dink hires me a month ago to eyeball her, right?  But Faith knows me from you, right, so she comes up to me and says, 'Hey Max why you following me?' I say, 'I'll buy you a drink and explain.' And she says...
Who was just here?
That would be between me and Faith, wouldn't it?
Way I look at it, I actually perform a humanitarian service.  I save lives.
Define illegal.
Fumitsu.
Coming with you.
Let's talk in the car.
You'll see.
So that gives you something.
Sure.
Jesus, Mace!
This tie doesn't go with blue!
Take it easy.  The glass is bullet resistant.
You sure?
Yeah.  You gave up your hot tub tape to save me.  That's real progress for you.
I still can't square the psycho smarts of whoever did Iris with those two cops.
Are you going to make me beg?
Cheerios and wieners.  I made it myself.  It's good.
Sssssh!  Not in front of Lenny.  You may trigger a maudlin display which will force us to tranquilize him.
Um... he was older.
Takes four days to chill, then its time to come back.  Is that...?
Just mopping up. Nine bodies in all.
Mack, this is Sheriff Dylan.
And it's getting dark. I'm not going to run this into the night.  Eddie, we're walking in. Everything covered?
Tape it off, we'll want to fine-tooth- comb it. My guess is that the UNSUB is having us on. He checks in, pays, picks up the key, but never walks inside. Tell me if I'm wrong.
Sheriff Dylan, this is FBI Agent Thomas Mackelway. Remember me?
What?
I'm not in the mood for Native American wisdom.
I appreciate it, doctor. You know how it is, press screaming for answers, Washington's all over me.  Ever handle a serial case?
This is Agent Mackelway.
Not a discrepancy, an error. My capacity is 5.5 tons, not 6.
Just gettin' a jolt of java before headin' on home?  How does your wife feel about it?
About your being away all the time. Must get lonely.
Oh God, mister, please leave me alone.
What do you want from me?
At the field office.
He got away. I had him. He got away.
"Was?"
I was looking for a pattern.
I didn't use Low's name.
Yeah, you know the vic's car, he was killed this side of the state line, the car then pushed across the border. This by an Unknown Subject, presumably the killer, who left no fucking evidence except the snapshot, which may or may not have been accidental.
This is no random killing, no one shot deal. The UNSUB has killed before; he's good at it. So what do we have?  We have someone who has killed before who kills someone who kills: a serial killer of a serial killer -- and who wants the FBI to know he exists.
Setting up. Technically, anyone in a chat room can be traced back to a screen address. But, by using punters, a correspondent literally punts his address around the world, through computers in countries that have no communication treaties. The correspondent becomes "ghosted," invisible.
That's the beauty of the system. This is a fugitive chat room. It moves from place to place, chat rooms that are normally empty at certain hours: a gardening website, Chaucer buffs, a dating service. A pre- arranged code shows up in one of fifty porn rooms -- that's where I stumbled across it -- notifying "friends" to meet at a certain time, usually midnight to three Eastern Standard, at a certain website -- a deserted chat room, say, "How to Plant Perennials." Come Tuesday, twelve a.m., bingo, these like-minded deviates log on and start yakking it up: explicit sex crime gossip, who did what to whom, who wants to do what, when, why and how.
Sex.
My guess: he's wondering whether to get more fries or go straight to the chocolate sundae.
He's a consultant to a network TV program on Profilers. He gets a check every episode.
Don't be too harsh.
Huh?
Of course he did. He came on to every attractive student. Which bothers you most: that he exploits suffering or that he came on to me?
"Intra-Agency fraternizing."
Does Koessler ask about me?
Not about coming to see Daitz?
We did find these, however.
You found the body. She was one of Harold Speck's victims. In El Paso.  They're not just talking to each other, Mack, they're trading souvenirs.
That's true.
What's that?
They say Richard Low is wrong, but because of him, women, innocent women, are alive who would be dead.
Could be a lot of things. Depends on the freezer.  I'm sorry, Mack, but I don't think this is the answer.
Yeah, of course.
Burn marks. The original M.E. listed it as "burn residue." Same place, the outer thigh, as Karen Sumpter. The UNSUB is able to abduct, kill, transport and bury without detection.
No weapon.
I'll be back.
The little piggie speaks.
I've been reading, hearing about you. I spoke to Koessler, Professor Daitz.
It was the mall.
Yeah.
Lead the way, Murman.
Let's go someplace private, Murman, I have something for you.
I like working for the Bureau, sir. I like catching bad guys. It's all I care about.
Hope you never do. At first it feels like a sauna, by the time you hit victim four it's a fucking burning shirt factory.
I know, I know.
You're right. I know.
Shuddup.
I'm sorry, I couldn't help it. Let me make it up to you.
Hi, Mike. I'm Lorraine.
It does.
Anything.
No... Maybe that's not the case. Maybe she shouldn't be such a smug little shit because she'd be surprised at what a good dancer he really is, but it's been a long time and he doesn't know if he's ready to...
Why not? This place is dead anyway.
I haven't heard an official "no" yet.
...Four days..?
Could you believe it?
Sorry?
You want this in black chips.
Yes, but I'm afraid this table has a hundred-dollar-minimum bet. Perhaps you'd be more comfortable at one of our lower stakes tables.
No...
There are different circuits... it's hard to explain... you wouldn't understand...
Actually, it's funny you... I'm actually, uh, between...
I know, but she did. She's with someone else now...
We were a rebound, and we lasted six years.
Sure, I guess. The phone's in the back.
Well... You can talk to a beautiful woman at a bar without worrying if anyone's watching you.
Yeah. And an actor.
If and when I get a real gig I'll call you.
Good eye. Not one club owner got it. They all ask me why I got Donald Duck on my card.
...Nah. I'm right across the street...
I'm not home and going out of town tomorrow for a week. Can't you talk for five more minutes?
Right.
Right... or more likely the opposite.
Hey man, don't sweat it.
Thanks. Thanks, man.
It's a gig.
You tested over a month ago. I'm sure they figured it out by now.
It's kinda like a speakeasy kind of thing. It's kinda cool. It's like you're in on some kind of secret. You tell a chick you've been some place, it's like bragging that you know how to find it. The only way you could know where a place is is if someone who knows brought you there. You have to have someone come before. There is a direct line connecting you back to the original, unequivocally cool, club patrons. It's kinda like Judaism...
Classy.
Bud.
I've been around here six months and I still can't get over it.
Well, let's hit that party.
I'll be your winger.
No problem, buddy. You eat anything today?
What's the point?
She wasn't your type anyway.
I didn't make it...
...for the same reason you miss her. You lived with it so long.
Make someone bleed.
Give me the money. I'll get it.
What about you, Mikey? At least I got balls. You're always whining about some bitch who dumped you a year ago...
Hi, Nikki. This is Mike. I met you tonight at the Dresden. I, uh, just called to say I, uh, I'm really glad we met and you should give me a call. So call me tomorrow, or, like, in two days, whatever. My number is 213- 555-4679... 
Sorry. We got knocked out pretty quickly.
Hang on, Voltaire.
I don't know...
Trent, I don't feel like going out tonight. I got shit to do tomorrow...
I don't know...
Be downstairs. You're beautiful.
Vegas!
Whu?
I'm telling you, they love that shit.
Who's fucking around? I'm not making fun. Let's do it, baby.
You think they're watching?
...but that's two hundred dollars. This is blood money...
You won. There's nothing to be sorry about. You're a winner. I'm the fuckin loser. I should be sorry.
Leave? The honey-baby's bringing us some cocktails.
...gotta...
That's what I'm telling you, baby. The babies love that stuff. They don't want all that sensitive shit. You start talking to them about puppy dogs and ice cream. They know what you want. What do you think? You think they don't?
I hope so.  We gotta go soon.
Oh... "I love you... I can't believe you're doing this... Drugs are bad..." Whatever. After-School bullshit. The role is Brother.
Yes!
Baby, you take yourself out of the game. You start talking about puppy dogs and ice cream, of course it's gonna be on the friend tip.
How?
What?!?
Yeah.
Oh. He's got it under control...
...It's on.
You're like this big bear with claws and fangs...
...Yeah. You're just gently batting it around... and the rabbit's all scared...
...you're money...
Now go over there and get those digits.
Yeah, but three days is kinda the money...
Listen. Just because I was the only one with the balls to stand up to them...
Have you gotten laid once since you moved here? Did you fuck once?
...it's on.
...it is so on.
Two vodka martinis, straight up, shaken not stirred, very dry, easy on the water.
Yes. 
I ask for Justice.
America has been good to me...
I'll come to you when I need you.
Shut up.
Sure.
Drive while you thinking; I wanna get to the City this month!
OK, go to Arthur Avenue; I'm suppose to call when I found somethin'.
Why do you come to me?  Why do I deserve your generosity?
The Tattaglias will guarantee your investment also.
I didn't tell Mama anything.  I was about to come up and wake you and tell you.  Just now.
I want children, I want a family. But I don't know when.
I could accept everything that's happened; I could accept it, but that I never had a choice.  From the time I was born, you had laid this all out for me.
Then why have I become a man like you?
How did you find out?
Nazorine, my friend, tell me what I can do.
You want him to stay in this country.
Where are you going?
Even so, I don't think it is safe here anymore.  I've made plans to move you to a villa near Siracuse. You must go right away.
The Don has semi-retired.  I'm running the Family business now. So anything you have to say, say it to me.
No, and I've been calling all night. Maybe he's shacked up.
I was as good a son to him as you or Mike.
OK forget it, just stay on the phone.
Then THEY hand me Sollozzo.
No no, no more advice on how to patch it up Tom.  You just help me win.  Understood?
I'll try...It's what the Don would want us to do.
Let's say now that we have to kill McCluskey.  We'll clear that up through our Newspaper contacts later.
Did he give you his politicians?
They're waiting to see my father.
Because they know that no Sicilian will refuse a request on his daughter's wedding day.
Yes.  Tell me.
Michael...
Then we can have dinner, see a show, and spend one more night.
Shhh, you be the long distance operator.  Here.
I'm thinking about it.
No, I would not like you better if you were Ingrid Bergman.
How is your father?
I love you.
OK. 
My parents don't read the Daily News.  All right, if you think I shouldn't.  I can't believe the things the papers are printing. I'm sure most of it's not true.
When will I see you again?
Goodbye.
I'm busy.
I don't need them, Sonny.  I'm just going to see Pop in the hospital. Also, I got other things.
I want to settle things tonight.  I want my father left alone.
What guarantees can I give you?  I am the hunted one.  I've missed my chance.  You think too highly of me, my friend...I am not so clever...all I want if a truce...
Yes, I promise.
I do renounce him.
I do wish to be baptized.
No.  I want things very calm for another six months.
He talked to you?
You took Freddie in because the Corleone family bankrolled your casino.  You and the Corleone family are evened out.  This is for business; name your price.
Do you recognize my voice?
Is that good?
Meet my father, Herbert Richard Greenleaf 1st.
I don't get it.
Marge, Ripley's saying goodbye.
It's the one task Dickie can do on his own -- make coffee.
It's always the same whenever someone new comes into his life -- Freddie, Fausto, Peter Smith-Kingsley -- he's wonderful -- did you meet him, he's a musician? -- ...and especially you, of course... and that's only the boys.
No, still here.
Marge! You've got to hear this!
No, I think your mother, her illness --
Your parents met her.
See Venice and die, isn't that right? Or is it Rome? You do something and die, don't you? Okay, Venice is on the list.
A few places -- that's a few jobs. Anyway, I don't want to think about New York.
No! I've got more than one shirt!
Now your signature.  Not "Dickie". Your signature.
Like Clark Kent.  Now Superman.
Pretty vile. See this: The S and the T, do you see? -- fine, vulnerable -- that's pain, that's secret pain.
No, no brothers, no sisters.
No!
Okay, you get in. I'm like a prune anyway.
He's getting impatient. He wants me to reassure him you'll be home by Thanksgiving.
I can't. I can't keep spending your father's money.
Relax. The most important question is where to eat. I hope Freddie made a reservation.
What club?
I thought you'd missed the train.
I'm not going to say anything -- to Marge, or anybody, the police -- It's a secret between us and I'll keep it.
Did I know you at Princeton, Tom? I didn't, did I?
Do you even like jazz -- or was that something for my benefit?
You can be a leech -- you know this -- and it's boring. You can be quite boring.
Hey, if I'm late, think what her husband's saying!
I don't think so. Come back with me to Rome. There's this great new club. Have some drinks, lotta ladies...
Aye, aye.
In fact the only thing which looks like Dickie is you.
Have you done something to your hair?
Is it on "delle Croce, just off the Corso"? You're a quick study, aren't you? Last time you didn't know your ass from your elbow, now you're giving me directions. That's not fair, you probably do know your ass from your elbow. I'll see you.
Tom Ripley. Thank you, sir.
I've always wanted to go to Europe, sir, but...
He's being thorough, that's all. I'm learning about my son, Tom, now he's missing. I'm learning a great deal about him. I hope you can fill in some more blanks for me. Marge has been good enough to do that, about Mongibello.
Hello, sir.  Marge, you should have waited, didn't Peter tell you I'd come by and pick you up?
Thanks, yes, I think we did.
Bird. That's jazz.
Frances?
What about Cortina?
Is that what he said -- he wanted to be alone?
Marge, how are you? What are you doing in Rome?
No.  Hello, I'm Tom Ripley.
My face! There was an argument. I said some things I shouldn't have. About you. About the appalling way he's treating you, all of us. And the next thing I know he's launched himself at me.  Are you getting on?
Get on. I'll take you to him.
No, well go if you want to, but don't talk to the Police about my face -- they find out he hit me -- he's got a temper -- he could've hit Freddie.  Good luck, Marge. I'll catch up with you later.
He's American. He's already discovered Dickie cashed checks for $1000 the day before he disappeared.
What?
I can explain.
Marge, calm down, you're being hysterical.
I don't believe you.
No glasses.
What?
Is Freddie in Rome?
Don't be sorry. I've never been happier. I feel like I've been handed a new life.
I'll take them both.
You're such a pal to understand. It's as if Marge is here now -- I look at you and I see her face -- and I can't, whatever I'm feeling towards you -- I just can't...
Otherwise you'd be fighting me off.
Just kidding. Are you alone?
And co. A lot of co. Oh, God, I've thought about you so much.
Peter Smith-Kingsley? I haven't seen him in months. No, I'm alone. 
Ten thirty?
It's ridiculous but now you've mentioned the stench I can hardly breathe.
No I did not. I did not kill Freddie Miles and then kill Dickie Greenleaf. Is he accusing me?  Ask him if he's accusing me!
You look ghastly, Tom. Are you okay?
Good. But I think we should stay in here for the rest of the trip.
Hardly kissing. Kissing off.
I suppose I always thought -- better to be a fake somebody than a real nobody.
You have the key. Tell me some good things about Tom Ripley. Don't get up. Just tell me some nice things.
Yes?
Never. We've had many requests and, of course, we say no -- even to your fiance.
November, I thought.
Does he stay with you here?
No. Here is a pattern. Two days ago Freddie Miles is dead -- he leaves your apartment and is murdered. Yesterday a little boat is found in San Remo full of rocks, and the owner tells the Police it was stolen on November 7th. We look at hotel records and we see oh! Dickie Greenleaf is staying in San Remo and then our boatman remembers two Americans taking a boat.
The .32's $150 -- and you're really getting a good deal now -- and all together it comes to, ah, seven eighty- five for four pieces and a holster. Hell, I'll give you the holster, we'll make it seventy-five and you've got a deal -- a good one.
You can't carry in a cab even with a permit -- so why bother?
Oh, I think he's a wonderful man. Make a great, great President.
If you don't mind, mam, I'd rather work for you.
Well, Betsy mam, I drive by this place here in my taxi many times a day. And I watch you sitting here at this big long desk with these telephones, and I say to myself, that's a lonely girl. She needs a friend. And I'm gonna be her friend. 
Oh, I appreciate that, Betsy mam. I'll be here at four o'clock exactly.  And... ah... Betsy...
The full moon. One night I had three or four weirdos in a row and I looked up and, sure enough, there it was -- the full moon.
Late one night. About three. At the plaza.
I didn't mean you. But just ordinary people. A guy I know -- Dough-Boy -- met his wife that way. They got to talking. She said she usually caught the bus so he started picking her up at the bus stop, taking her home with the flag up.
I work a single, which means there's no replacement -- no second man on the cab. Six to six, sometimes eight. Seventy-two hours a week.
What?
Yeah. Yes. I don't follow music too much.
Yeah, well my stereo player is broke. But I'm sure the record is OK.
I'm leaving.
I mean porno movies.
Keep it.
Hello, Betsy.
No, c'mon, I'm listening. I was just...
That taxi driver. The one that's been sitting here.
You sure he's not Italian?
We don't have ju-jukes. We don't have Coca-Cola. We only got Royal Crown Cola.
Ask Travis. He's the ladies man.
No.
Could you see anything?
Yeah.
I never use mine. But it's a good thing to have. Just as a threat.
And the kid says, "Yeah. She's about 19, good-lookin." McCall says, "What can I tell you?"
You looking for some action?
All right.  You see that guy over there?  His name is Sport. Go talk to him. I'll wait here.
It's your time mister. Fifteen minutes ain't long.  That cigarette burns out, your time is up.
Easy.
I drive a taxi. You tried to get away one night. Remember?
You can do it in my mouth.
Where is home?
That fella "Sport" looks like a killer to me.
I... I don't get along with people like that.
Besides, I've got to stay here.
I think you should go home, but otherwise I think you should go. It would be great for you. You have to get away from here. The city's a sewer, you gotta get out of it.
I'll give you the money to go. I don't want you to take any from those guys.
There isn't time for that. In other words, you don't know.
Thank you, sir. You're a good man, sir.
No Sir.
You moonlightin?
Well then check back tomorrow.
Why do you ask?
O.K., cowboy.
Slow.
The taxi life, you mean.
You think I'm too...  ethnic for country music?
Ancient Greece.  Alchimadus was imprisoned by his king.
Don't let him do that.
You suppose?
Where is he sir?  RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME.  What's he doing?  HE'S ON THE= PHONE.  I DON'T FUCKING KNOW, HIS STOCKBROKER! Oh shit.  Gotta go.
For cottonmouth. Goodspeed and the S.E.A.L.s exchange looks.
Now they only have three rockets left.
I'm not a field agent, all right?  So cut me a break.
Whatever happens.
I wish you were coming with me.
Mr. Chairman, as I understand it, the Fifth Amendment pertains to self-incrimination, and I can't incriminate myself because I've done nothing wrong.  Besides, incrimination is why you have Mr. Clyde working for you.
And  I love you, Pete!
Delly?  In here.
Well...
Honey, I... I can't... it's the...
You look... different.
Yeah, a little.  I think you grew an inch or so.  And you've lost weight.
You must not remember anything. Come on.
Why me?
Actually, I was married.  For four years.  But... well, we didn't fit together.  I'm divorced now.
No, it's okay.  See, when two people belong together, the other person should be the... the key that unlocks the rest of you... I'm not making sense, am I?
Eventually.  We were going to be  engaged... when you came back from  overseas...
Oh...
It's gonna cost over nine hundred dollars to open the place, Delly.
A loan to a man who ran his business into the ground and his son who can't account for the last nine-and-a-half years of his life? Not likely.
Alex and Charlie?  Simple.  Alex is the smarter one.
Guess I must've learned.
Delly.  I'm... I'm not... Harry wasn't my father.  And I'm not... I'm not Luke.
Mr. Appleton, do you know an "Albert Lucas Trumbo?"
Is that because you were masquerading as Luke Trumbo while you were in Lawson?
Yes, I see that Private Trumbo was reported missing in action and is presumed dead.  I also see that you were posted stateside during the war.  Fort Dix?
Yes.
Well, I know that I lost my job because of one meeting I went to when I was a kid in college.  I know that I've been branded a communist, which I'm not, but even if I was, it shouldn't matter, or what do we have a Bill Of Rights for?
That's not a contradiction at all, sir.  I went to the meeting, but I didn't go as a member.
Don't mention it.  Welcome home, Luke.
No identification at all.  What're you thinkin', Cecil?
Give the man a hug, boy!  That's your father!
Exactly.  Break it to her gently.
Good to meet you.  Again.
We're gonna try.  Place needs a lot of work.
A super market.  Huh.
Well, after the war, with so many of the town's boys killed, people around here didn't much feel like going to the movies, I guess.  Some of 'em moved away -- Los Angeles, Sacramento, San Francisco.  Wasn't much to keep 'em here, I expect. And now with this "television" thing -- people just aren't going out as much as they used to.
No, your mother did, then I did after she passed.
Yeah, I know, but poultry...?
Dad, I...
What.
Pete...
I guess I did.
She's very pretty.
Uh, no... just seeing you standing there, it reminded me... there's a word for it...
Hey, it's the best way to tell.
I... I don't believe this.
Leo, I was trying to impress a skirt.  You know me, I'm non- political.  Republican, Democrat, Communist, there's not a dime's worth of difference between 'em anyway.
I was decorated.
Why not?
Yes.  Leo, goddammit... this isn't fair!
I'm not sorry for what I said.
Luke didn't smoke.
Leo, you were in there, you saw what I did.  You think they're gonna let me write pictures?  Hell, they're probably gonna throw my ass in jail.
What do you mean?
Leo, I didn't give them the names. I wouldn't do that.
So, our lawyers had a talk with the Committee's lawyers.  That Elvin Clyde fella won't be too happy about it, but we cut a deal. They cleared you -- and they're gonna thank you publicly for your testimony purging yourself.
Climb down off your cross.  They already knew about her.  She was subpoenaed six months ago! Who the hell do you think named you?
When was that?
Oh dear, yes.  You were an excellent student, before all that clarinet nonsense.  You loved Chopin.  You used to call it "heaven music."  "Teach me some heaven music," you used to say.
No, I...
What?
Yeah.  I hope you don't mind.  I didn't know anyone lived here... well, besides Harry.  And me.
Cat.
We thought you was dead, you know.  It's okay that I live here?
Thanks.
Oh.
Oh...
I thought you...
I'll have to think about this.  I have to get back... I should go...
Actually, my grandpap.  But "ancestors" sounds better, don't it?  Here.
It's a lovely garden.
No. Just a few hours.
Well... something like that.  I'm sorry. I don't mean to sound so mysterious.
Yes, I did.
Sure. You can have it.  Where's your bag? In the car?
I just picked up some things for the night at the general store. You see, I hadn't planned on spending much time here.
If you have some, I'd...
Where are you from originally, Annie?
Annie -- there's nothing between Mitch and me.
I can understand his position. He went through a lot with Lydia after his father died. He didn't want to risk going through it all over again.
You get straight to the point, don't you?
If your father were here...
Take them.
I don't think your mother would like that.
I know.
Did you put the cover on that cage, Mom?
I don't know, honey.
I wish I could say. But if I could answer that, I could also tell you why people are trying to kill people.
Shhh. Shhhhh.
I think they'll be all right, honey.
Right here. Bodega Bay.
That's where the Brenners live.
Nope, just Lydia and the two kids.
Nope. That's the road. Straight through town, stay on your left, right around the bay to the front door.
D'you want me to order one for you?
The little Brenner girl?
Well, I ain't positive, if that's what you mean.
Impossible.
The crow is a permanent resident throughout its range. In fact, during our Christmas Count, we recorded...
Stop worrying, Deke. She was in a boat.
We'll make our own fog.
They're back!
I had to acknowledge a delivery.  Mother, I'd like you to meet...
Melanie Daniels. Melanie, my mother.
For Cathy. For her birthday. By the way, where is she?
Yes, lovebirds. We couldn't let you...
...get away without thanking you in some small way. After all, you haven't even met Cathy and you are staying for the weekend...
I don't know what good that'll do.  Chickens won't eat.
Caviat emptor, Mother. Let the buyer beware.
Yes.
I told you. We met yesterday.
I know, Mother.
I don't know when.  We'll see what...
I don't know yet.  I think we'll be safe here.  Let's bring that wood in.
You don't know, you don't know! When will you know? When we're all dead? Like Annie?
Oh, my God, look at her!
But they'll be back.
No, not exactly.
What?
I keep seeing Dan Fawcett's face.  They have such big windows at the school.  All the windows were broken. In Dan's bedroom. All the windows.
I'll just clear up here, and then dress.
Shhhh. Shhhh.
What are we going to do about it, Al?
All right, I'll grant you a bird'll panic in an enclosed room. But, they didn't just get in. They came in! Right down that chimney.
What I'm trying to say, Mitch, is these things happen sometimes, you know? Ain't much we can do about it. 
Eleven. In the middle of the party, some gulls came down at the children. And Miss Daniels was attacked by a gull just yesterday after...
Thanks, Al. We'll be all right.
That's all right.
What?
All these innocent little creatures caged up like this?
I was merely drawing a parallel, Miss Daniels.
Ahhh, but I know you.
I simply believe in the law, Miss Daniels, and I'm not too keen on practical jokers.
Ahhh, but I really do want those birds.
I am.  Good day.  Madam. 
What made it...
I'm sorry.  What are you doing up here?
What for?
I'm sorry.  Who's your friend?
I think we'll have to shave the hair. Deke, have you got a razor?
It's still bleeding a little. Here, let me put this on.
Yes.
Why would I want to see you, of all people?
I can't say I like your seagulls much, either. I come all the way up here to...
Of course, how stupid of me. A quarter to seven, will that be all right?
You're sure now? You won't hire a boat or anything?
Famished.
He was watching a ball game on television.
I'm neither poor nor innocent, but the truth of that particular...
No.
What do you do?
Like what?
Helping travelers.
What about Thursdays and Fridays?
I... I am.  Mitch, is... Mitch, this isn't usual, is it? The gull yesterday when I was in the boat, and the one last night at Annie's, and now...
With my little sparrow leading team.
Yes.  I'm tired, Mitch. I'm so very very tired.
We'll take it slow until we get to the main road.  Are you ready?
And he'll talk?
Thank you.  Do you know Dan Fawcett's number?
Birds are not aggressive creatures, Miss. They bring beauty to the world. It is mankind, rather, who...
I hardly think a few birds are going to bring about the end of the world.
Then help me, Sebastian. You're an important man in this town. If you'll help, the rest will.
I'm not sure, but...
How?
Can we go on living here otherwise?
That would hardly be possible.
I'm very pleased to know you, Master Fettes.
Of course -- it's the soul of the business -- the pay --
Good morning.
I can't do that -- you heard MacFarlane.
You're over-excited, Mistress Cameron.
But that's long since.  Gray can't threaten him with that.
Aye.
At Pennycuik.  I know the inn.  I can be there in an hour.
Excuse me.
Well? And are you not a good student?
Richardson is a fine student.  He's got a glib tongue, but you'll be a better doctor, Fettes.  Come along now --
I'm sorry for the woman, Fettes. But her son might be alive today had more doctors been given the opportunity to work on more human specimens.  As for me, Fettes, I let no man stop me when I know I'm right -- when I know that I need those lifeless subjects for my student's enlightenment and for my own knowledge.  And if you're a real man and want to be a good doctor, you'll see it as I see it.
So she told me.  I'm a teacher -- not a practitioner.
This girl was beautiful -- a wild lassie from the Highlands.
He has his own idea of a joke. Perhaps his horse tickled him in the ribs.
That's the way of it, Fettes.  You bring the lassie to me.
But she must want to stand.  She must want to walk.
I'll have no more to do with it. I'll not put my neck into the noose, not even for your sake, Dr. MacFarlane.
What?
He was a nice horse.
I want it --
Your son, ma'am?  He must have been a fine boy for the wee dog to love him so.
A doctor?
Oh, yes, you will.  You'll do it to oblige Fettes and myself.
I suppose we can't prevent that, Gray --  -- for auld lang syne.
I've had some experience.
Oh, it's the bit of a girl Fettes was talking about.
In the brain, I tell you. I know.
There is much in what I say, Gray, and if you have any regard for your neck you'll leave now and stay away from my house, my school, and from me.
Would you grudge me a glass with my old crony, Meg?
So, Toddy, you've made me a disease, eh?
But then I wouldn't have the fun of having you come here and beg again, Toddy.
No, Joseph. I'm not angry -- here -- another glass of brandy --I'll wager it's better than the doctor's.
I never heard that song. But what did they do?
Yes, Doctor.
But, Doctor, surely in a case like this -- a child -- a little child who can never walk or run --
I'll get him.
Aye.
You sent them. I had no choice.
I'm thinking... that explains a lot.
What do they do that they had to kill her?
I think we should get some support?
I guess it's true. Guns don't kill people...
They showed me pictures, what he did to her. Evidence. Said all I had to do was stand up there and not my head "yes."
A job. Construction. Twelve an hour.
What Scar? What fucking scar?
What happened to your leg there Officer? Hunting accident?
Nobody.
Your father gave them to both of you.
And another one. There. Erlich. Took a wrong turn.
Yes I do, I really do.
My father.
It's not. I can't take it.
I don't know. I found him lying there.
I know.
Sign of the dead come back to life.
He's looking for something. Won't stop until he finds it.  Sometimes the best way to get rid of someone is to let them have what they want.
She was eighteen years old! There were four of them. They stabbed her fifty three times! Where's the fucking accident?! Huh?! Where is it?!
She's... sick.  Actually she never had Mai Tais before.
I want you... to bend over.
Just hold on to me.
Looks like you have them both on.
Erin. It wasn't supposed to happen.
I talked to most of them this morning... They were all very curious about the meeting.
Almost negligible... With variation of parameters, this is the answer.
It isn't faith that makes good science, Mr. Klaatu. Its curiosity.  Sit down, please. I have several thousand questions to ask you.
Yes -- that is true.
Would you care to be more specific?
Violent action -- since that seems to be the only thing you people understand.  Leveling the island of Manhattan, perhaps -- or dropping the Rock of Gibraltar into the sea.
I assure you such power exists.
Gee, why, Mom? He's my best friend... And he's awful good in arithmetic. He even helps Professor Barnhardt.
I couldn't go to sleep, Mom. I had to tell you!
Yes, dear. Come on now.  Bobby, your shoes are soaking!
Yes -- I think so.
I don't know, Bobby. I'm inclined to doubt it.
Well, sure I would, but --  Aw, I'll bet you'd be scared.
It's a problem in celestial mechanics.
All right.
Mr. Brady's a cop.
Thanks, Mr. Carpenter.
Just Klaatu.
From another planet. Let's just say that we're neighbors.
We've been monitoring your radio broadcasts for a good many years. That's how we learned your languages. Lately, we've been getting your television also.
You still haven't answered my question.
Bobby and I have had enough excitement for tonight.
Come on in.
That's what I'm trying to tell you. We mustn't do anything about it. Believe me, Tom, I know what I'm talking about.
I don't care about the rest of the world!
I'm not going to marry anybody.
Jittery is the word.
I -- I didn't really pay much attention--  Bobby has such an active imagination.
Before I ask you to be honest with me, perhaps I should be completely honest with you--
Where is the meeting going to be?
I'm worried about Gort. I'm afraid of what he might do -- if anything should happen to me.
You mean he has the power of life and death?
We came to see Professor Barnhardt.
I'd give you a very good price.
You don't.
They would have killed this man?
It's a pretty cool place if you're a Martian.
He's my brother.
We blew it, Edgar!  We lost it!
Time to activate Plan B.
I've only got one question for you, and I want an honest answer.  Have you taken any human victims yet?
Man, we totally annihilated his night-stalkin' ass!
What?...
If you ever want to see Star again, then you better come with us.
You're almost one of us now, Michael.
Where the hell are you from, Kryton???
His fingernails are longer, but he always has bad breath.
That is very probable.  What's your reasoning?
How do you know they're not?
It's called the Indian walk. Walkin' without makin' a sound.
Lots more where he came from.
Gotta keep in practice.  It's a dyin' art.
I better get cleaned up, then.
No.  Just you.
He's just a deep sleeper.
Oh, no, you won't.
Then let's act like friends. Let's talk.  I know this is a new place, and --
Ah... I didn't know you were having guests...
This is not a joke.  They know that we know about them.  They're coming to the house as soon as it gets dark!
-- I'm not talking about Max!  To hell with Max!
Do I look that needy?
I know.  It's so 'Eighties.'  It's the Cute Decade.
I guess if I had my choice, I'd like to do something that involves children.  Work with kids in some way.  Teenagers, maybe.  And Santa Carla seems to be full of them.
No, no.  Just worrying about my boys -- as usual.
Michael invited me in.  Never invite a vampire into your house. It renders you powerless.
Well, I...
If you want your ear pierced, I'll do it.
Star.
Me, too.
Sort of.  We used to come here summers when I was kid.  Now we're here on a permanent basis.
Okay.
No.  They've made me one of them, but I miss my family.
Tonight.  At the boardwalk...
Okay.
I'm weak... Soon I'll need to feed.
That's okay, Mom.  I can see it later.  I'll help you unload.
Wanna change my hair, my clothes, my face.
You're supposed to watch me and entertain me, and make me appreciate the brief but happy years of childhood.
Piss off.
I don't know, Michael.  This is not like breaking a lamp or getting a 'D'.
Don't kill anybody until we get back to you...
And the horse you rode in on. Sixteen for how long?!  You can't predict this time of year...
Dogs don't eat each other.
Finish what?
Have you come across Fuchs?
Ain't it there?
Don't walk behind me.
Now who'd go and do...
If it did get to him.
That key ring of yours is always hooked to your belt.  Now how could somebody get to it without you knowing?
Who you trying to protect, mutherfucker?  I'm telling you this S.O.B. could be one of them.
No.  The generator.  You got the auxiliary box just off the kitchen. Get to it.  Where's the damn flashlight?  You fellas okay over there?
It's shorted out or something!
Clark, you want me to come in after you?!
That's good enough.
We'll see.  Let's try Clark.
The fire's got the temperature way up all over camp... won't last long though.
If you're worried about anything, let's take that blood test of yours.
All in Norwegian.
Nothing we can do about that.
How far's that?
Well, stick with it.  I want you at it round the clock.  We got to get help in here...
Thought you'd feel that way, Garry. You were the only one who could have gotten to that blood plasma...  ... we'll do you last...
One thousand volts.  Should be enough.
Little over two hours.
Blair.  He's gone berserk.
Copper thinks they swallowed pieces of it during the fight.
Mac, where the hell is that pump!!
Everything that's been missing.
We got any more of those electronic chess things down in supply?
No chance it could have been some new kind of test craft?
MacReady, that you?
Hear what?
I had an accident.
And everyone looks like us?
You have books?!  Kalen, you've got to take me there.  There might be history.  Records.  Something to help us find where the Morlocks took --
No...
But you're only a mud carrier.
How did you know?!
I know you -- you're an automaton of some sort that --
Excuse me?
This is the way in?
Yes... Thank you.
The air... the power.
Alexander.
How do you control the Morlocks?
They survived above.  Became what they are.
Go back to where you came from.  Or die here.
We have lost the capacity to reproduce.  But the species must continue.
When a creature shows too much independent thought we remove them from the gene pool.  We're breeding them for submission.  Soon they will be fully domesticated.
Yes.  Initiative and daring are not desirable traits in the Eloi.  But you should be happy for her.  She won't remember the creature she was.  She will... become.
No...
You have my word...  ... She's just a beauty.
I -- what are you?!
Why is it -- breaking up?
Not here... alone.  May we? Please?
You know I can't.
I need... to talk to you.
Nothing -- let's just get out of the park.
I want to get into the light, that's all.  Please...
Alex, it's just the zoo.
No, I'm fine.  I'm...  ... wonderful.  Just walking down the street with you again.
Not like this.  Never like this. Emma, I swear to you -- if I've learned one thing, it's that moments like this are rare.  And I will thank God for them every moment of every day.
I've seen it.
You know generally teachers are supposed to teach real equations that add up to real numbers.
Alex, this is your first year as an associate professor.  You might want to play things a little more conservatively.
I want my students to emerge with theoretical and practical knowledge.
I came by the house every day after the funeral.  And then every week. Then every other month.  Then I stopped coming.  Did you even notice?
That's where you're wrong.  I will change it.
You're dying here.  Don't you see that?!
Sir...?
I don't understand.
Yes...
And you saw a shape ahead of you...
Thank you.
I mean, why do you do it?  What purpose does it serve?
Or mud carriers.
You know this?
So you can use it now?
Exactly correct, sir.
I took a different route.
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to...
We choose to believe it.
Young man, we have a way of doing things here.  Radical theorizing is not acceptable.  Have I made myself understood?
Kalen...
What's it like where you come from?
Must be all the exercise I get scampering up and down these stairs like a wee lamb.
That wasn't a fucking restraint.
Maybe not. [Beat] But I do think you're in a tree... woofing like a dog. And I'm just trying to help you the only way I can think of.
You sure you know where to find one?
You in here. [Beat] Works like a drug.
No. I'm not his son. I'm him. [Beat] What? You look like you've seen a ghost. You can come here and touch me, old man. I'm the real thing.
How?
I'm in it as we speak. [Beat] You're haunting yourself right now. [Beat] I guess sometimes we indict ourselves if no one else does. You didn't make history like you wanted to, huh, Dr. Becker. It turned out different, didn't it?
You may have known my father, William Starks.
His body was found on January 1, 1993, but do you know if that was long after he had died?
William Starks. [Beat] Thanks.
[Beat] I know it doesn't make sense. It doesn't even make sense to me.
[Beat] What?
I don't know. But he did die. STARKS falters under the news. JACKIE looks around, through her now blurred eyes, like she might find some help in the apartment. She settles for the BOTTLE of VODKA on the table, lowers the iron fork and takes a long heavy drink, then laughs nervously as she looks up.
I know.
Here, drink this. I'll get the heat going.
Yeah. I called the number yesterday to make sure. Thomas Becker, retired M.D.
To the hospital.
When we first met, when you were 7, where was the house you lived in with your mother? Do you remember your address?
I fell down. [Beat] But I'm alive.
Why would we do that?
It doesn't look all that different.
Because I don't have time.
I don't know how you know about Eugene, but these ideas are part of your delusions.
Listen to me. That's all I ask.
What are you talking about?
I wasn't talking about anything.
So what am I supposed to do?
I've been here for 11 years. It's my neighborhood. 'Course I'm sure. He's as drugged up as the rest of us...I guess he has to be to put up with all this.
Well, you definitely didn't pick normal or simple this time either.
The best I could do with what was in your fridge.
I'm sorry.
No, Thelma, I don't give a shit what we have for dinner.  I may not even make it home for dinner.  You know how Fridays are.
See ya.
I could shoot your cousin Eddie.
I don't know, honey.  I guess it would depend.
That's Thelma Dickinson's husband.
Well, son, she's doin' a damn sight better 'n you right now.
You might say we had a meeting of the minds, yes.
You're still with us though.  You're somewhere on the face of the earth?
Oh, definitely.
It's okay.  I'm married, too.
Shut up.
Thelma?  It's me.
I don't know.  Nothin'.  Took a shower.
Well, I was just down on my luck and it seemed like somethin' I was good at so I...
God.  You're a real live outlaw!
Who's your friend?
Louise, just tell me what the hell is going on here!  I come back, nobody knows where you are.  Is Thelma with you?  Darryl's been callin' here every half-hour sayin' he's gonna kill you both when you get back, he's goin' nuts.  I don't envy her if she is.
Of course.  Of course!  Where?  Can't I bring it to you?  For God's sake, baby, please, just tell me what's happened, what could possibly be so bad?
Call me back.
Peaches.
Maybe.
Oh yeah.
Am I in trouble?
No, I'm callin' from the Playboy Mansion.
What time are you gonna pick me up?
How come he let you go?
We've not gonna get to the cabin till after dark as it is, Thelma.
I wonder if Jimmy's gotten back.
Get the car!
Tell them what?!  What, Thelma? What do you think we should tell them?
So this is all my fault, is it.
Well, when you figure it out, wake me up.
I suggested we go to the police, but you didn't like that; so, frankly, Louise, I'm all out of ideas.
Give me the keys.
Call him.  Don't tell him anything. Tell him you're having a wonderful time and you'll be home tomorrow night.
I don't know.  I won't be.
Thelma!  I'm not gonna talk about this!  Now find another way or give me the goddamn map and I will!  You understand?
She thinks he's a pig.
He's always got it bad as long as I'm running in the other direction. Don't be fooled, he's no different than any other guy.  He knows how to chase and that's it.  Once he's caught you, he don't know what to do.  So he runs away.
Taking a shower.
Yeah.
You're right.
Yeah.
Just ignore him.
We should have just ignored him.
Nothing.  It's not funny.
Thelma!
Okay, Louise... It's okay.
About how fast was I going?
Okay, okay... I've got some tequila. You want some tequila?
What do you mean?
Well, let me know when you figure it out.
We can change our names.
It'd have to be pretty good.
You're drivin'.
Texas... You were right about what happened to me there.
Did you see that guy?!  He was right in the middle of the road!
Oh.
What?!
All this for us?
Go?
Fresno.
Damn.  I hate that!  I hate bein' called a beaver, don't you?
So you admit it?
I guess.
You sent that?
Stop that! No! Somebody help me!!!!!
Loser? You?
Look, I admit it was brief, but it was definitely love. Crushes don't last twelve years.
I told you, her family moved to Miami.
Yeah, right.
Hey, look on the bright side --
Christ, Ted, I was only four towns away.
Huh? But why did Healy?
Remember our friend Healy? Well, I didn't know where to mail his last paycheck so I sent my assistant by his mother's apartment. Turns out there is no diabetic mom. Landlord said she's been dead for ten years.
Are you crazy? I've unleashed a psycho on her. She's gonna be fucking pissed.  She's even more beautiful than I remember.
Just relax. Have you hit the cash machine?
Hm?
Pipes? What are you talking about?
I'm usually too tired to be.
Holy shit, I've been going out with a loaded gun!
You stole her from me. Now I want her back.
Oh come on, why would I lie?
You got a brew?
Yep.
I don't know. I guess... it just seems that women today are more impressed by the mighty buck than by some schmo who spent the last seventeen years scraping by on Peace Corp wages.
You own a home there?
Same here again.
It's right there on your golf bag.
That sounds like fun.
Here you go.  What's that smell?
What say we get outta here and go crush a bucket?
That...? Vestibule.
Sadly, no. Well except for the lint.
A fucking moron.
Come on, what were you going to say?
Warren!
I don't know, maybe you could poke around for a half day and see if she has five kids and a Labrador.
You don't buy what?
No.
You can't be serious.
Huh?
Three different guys?
She's in a wheelchair?!
You sure, big guy? I'll bet she'd love to hear from you before her mastectomy!
Good good.
Surprised?
Do what?
You're a sick man, you know that?
Nice smokescreen, isn't it?
I'm sorry, I'm not familiar with it. What style?
Oh look, it's Doob! Will you excuse me a minute, Tucker?
Who the fuck do you think you are making up that bullshit about me?!
Hey, hey, hey, I'm not the one who started telling bald-faced lies about the competition -- that's crossing the line!
Fucking sickening.
I never said that.
Hey, this is a pretty nice place.
What?
Oh that makes a lot of sense. Why would I rat myself out?
Nah. I'm... I'm nothing.
The exercise tape? Sure, I've seen it on T.V.
Well it's the company motto: 'If you ain't happy we'll send you the extra minute.'
But here's the rub. The guy I'm talking about has got to be self- employed.
No I'm not.
All right for awhile? The guy's good- looking, rich, witty. He was a god.
Bet your ass I have. It's an important job, Neighborhood Watch is.
These ain't strangers, they're neighbors. This only picks up signals in a half-mile radius.
Name's Patrick, I met him at the driving range.
He's no Steve Young.
Come on, Magda  It's like that movie Harold and Maude.
Must have a sweet tooth. See if you can find some cookies.
Why?
Love? Come on, I wouldn't call it love.
Hey, no kidding? Where are your offices?
Where would I have seen your work?
Look, it's just that something about him struck me as odd last night. He gave me this funny vibe. Anyway, I called some friends back east. They don't know of any architect named Patrick Healy and he's not listed as a Harvard alumnus.
Well... I've got a little more news about your friend Healy.
Okay, just calm down. It's going to be okay.
You mean he's not a criminal?
No, a couple of the players and me were joking around and, uh, I fell off the school.
Oh, I don't know. I think proms are pretty dumb.
Oh. Okay. I gotcha.
You betcha!
Oh yeah, healed right up. No visible scars.
Really? I never got a message.
No, it was a good thing.  I mean, good in that it was very quick.
Funny story. You see, me and a buddy of mine decided to... ah... you know... just... drive down.
Nope, nope -- dodged a few bullets.  God, I cannot believe I'm standing here with Mary Jenson.
Hi, Ted.
Ah, my roots here are too deep. I love my practice, the people I work with, Warren's got a nice thing going  Why don't you just move down here and marry me?
What about you, Mare? How the hell'd you manage to stay single?
All right, let's go.
You got what stuck?
Shhhhhh!
I wasn't trying --
No, no, no, I'll be fine. I'll just hang my shirttail out and work on it in the morning.
Yeah, I'll bet you all were. Come on, in the truck.
Bye, Ted.
What are you doing?
What --
Did you have any indication of this from Georgi? Any possible warning or sense of motivation?
McNamara's on his way back here now. We need to pick the right ship. No subs. No armed boarding parties either. We need a little more time to figure this one out.
He didn't have to worry about nuclear weapons.
It's too politicized with you in there, anyway. They need to be able to stick their necks out.
-- I'm just trying to make a point. This idea is that fucking bad.
He better. Because nobody thinks he's up to this. Nobody.
No, Ken. I need to see him now...
Then they should speak up.
Yeah.
Says what, Kenny?
Mr. President, there is another possibility we haven't considered. This may not be a coup at all.
Kids are supposed to get detention.
Yeah.
I, uh...
There've got to be alternatives to just going out and bombing them.
Then we need to do a few things right away. No Pierre. He knows, the press knows. You're going to have to keep up your schedule -- your movements are followed too closely. And we need to get these guys out of the White House. George Ball's got a conference room at State.  Reconvene over there this afternoon, come back here tonight.
No way.
You're scared to cancel on Daly.
I don't know. I don't know.
They want this fucking job, they can have it. It's no great joy to me.
I know, I know...
Have to hope it's a signal that he'll back down on the real issue too.
And we can't purge the Chiefs. Our invasion talk will look like a bluff. Or even that there's been an attempted coup.
If we made a trade, we'd be giving in to extortion, and NATO would never trust us again. We'll get clobbered in world opinion.
And we do it under the table so we can disavow any knowledge of it.
Listen to me, goddamn it. We're talking about a possible nuclear war. You dropped the ball on Bay of Pigs --
You were in the room. It was your purview. It was your job to make sure Bissel wasn't fucking us over and you didn't do it. You've got the most important job in the world right now. You're the smartest guy the President has.  Besides me.
Why else would they approach us in this way? It's deniable. The Soviets have done nothing but lie to us. This could be more of the same.
Don't have one, Carl. I have a number, man. Just like the numbers on those treasury checks. You stole from your own country, Carl. Shame on you.
It ain't Geronimo.
Goodbye.
Jesus...
You crashed my file?
That's what it looks like, doesn't it? But that's what a ten gauge, choke-bored, shotgun will look like when it hits your lower back from five feet away.
Good.
How'd you know?
Go ahead.
One of the leaders of the Warriors of All Red Nations. Militant organization.
Easy, Cowboy. No vendettas on my ship. Now: remember what I told you about Nam? Watch the grass, watch the trees, watch the shit house, be on your toes, and if we get committed, don't hesitate to empty that sucker.
She talks a lot of shit. We're not doing our job. Jimmy's innocent. "What's the FBI really doing here." Some shit about the Fort Laramie Treaty.
Cooch. What's the Fort Laramie Treaty?
Thanks, Cooch.
All I could think of was... not here. I don't wanna eat it on an Indian Reservation, three thousand miles from home.
She's that subtle?
The Little Walking River. You're right. This is part of it. So whoever sunk this car didn't compensate for drought. Goddamn.
Sorry, Cooch. I lost Eagle Bear --
Let the press through.
Watch out!
Is that right? Well, listen to this: drag your ass. This is a restricted area.
Medicine. As in medicine man?
Good question. Hardly sees anybody anymore. Hasn't left this place in twenty years. Did you bring some tobacco?
You want solid? That one, single, print he left in the Badlands -- the one the FBI missed and then stepped all over -- it belongs to a man who walks heels first. Like a white man. Jimmy has a serious Ind'n walk -- ball of the foot first. The man who murdered Leo walked like a Wasi'cu.
Grandpa traded with me.  Goodbye.
What'd you expect to hear?
Crow Horse, listen --
Sorry.
Uranium. Test holes. Somebody came in from the Nebraska side, and did some shotgun testin'. They're gettin' ready to suck this baby dry.
What?
We're going for The Stronghold.
You didn't have another vision...
Jimmy didn't kill Leo. Why do you wanna do this?
You forced an innocent man to run like an animal. You've tried to poison my people's hearts against me with your manipulation, with letters I never wrote... you've been watching me eat, work, raise my family... wash myself in the river. And now you're here, arresting me at a sacred place.  In your eyes, that's power.
Wa-shee is like... a dumpling. Like tallow we put in stew. I think he was calling you chubby boy.
No. No, no. Thank you.
Must be a bitch getting around in that wheelchair. How long you been in it?
At Sioux Falls Pen?
I get thrown in solitary until I don't know my own fuckin' name, and then you people tell me I can beat nine years if I help you. I helped you!
They sent me here, Richard because they said you didn't hold up your end of the arrangement, and I have to transport you back to Leavenworth.
Was there ever a girl who didn't like fighter pilots?
What if Captain Dawson had come with me?
It's classified.
Yes, ma'am, At first. Then I was directly above him.
I was inverted.
You know. The finger.
What are you talking about?
I'm starting to sense that now.
Somebody does. It's more honest this way. You do your own dirty work.
About as much as they think about killing me.
All you've got is one life. I guess it's worth about the same to every body. You ever see an old woman after her husband has died? And the meaningless years of decline stretch ahead...  When you're in the air and doing something really dangerous, you can look ahead... maybe ten seconds. That's your whole future. That's as far as it goes. But imagine what those seconds are worth.
And now?
I'm still second best.
. Yeah!
Why, what's gonna happen?
What do you take me for? It's a Navy Cross.
Where'd you get it.
He was a friend of mine. A good guy...great guy. It was my fault.
That's what I want.
Hardly ever.
It does.
Who's gonna win?
I didn't want to see you. I mean, I did...but I didn't..
How could you?
I hope you find him.
Sir. You are going to give me a warning, Sir!
Well?
Remember one thing.
You'll have mine, Cougar. It'll be where your head used to be.
Okay, okay.
I GOT ONE COMING UP.
You go. I'm staying with it.
Any more MiGs?
Oh, no. You did the flying, I'll do the talking!
You gotta have a call sign that's just your own...never changes...you have to recognize it immediately. Then, if someone shouts "Wolf, break left!"..you react right away.
On what?
Like what?
What do you think it was? Was it that MiG contact that did it?
So's my Johnson.
Who's your pilot?
So I heard. Steers it pretty close. Sorry to hear about Cougar. He was a good man.
COUGAR, YOU'RE ON THE BALL.
Nothing...That's McGown...that's Singer, isn't it? GOOSE Turn around, pay attention. What are you doing?
What, been drunk? Sure! Plenty!
Pay no attention to it. They're just trying to rattle you. It's all psychological. Sit down..and drink.
What?
Nothing. Let's just go fight.
Bogey at three o'clock high! Nose on!
Wood's okay. I want Viper.
I guess that's what I'm doing, then.
What'd you do?
Well, you'll just have to make do with him .
The girl with the purple fingernails?
STAY OUT OF IT. STAY OUT OF IT, MAVERICK.
I think I can work it out on my own.
I've heard of you, too. You were in 124 with Bargamian.
Yeah, we get one of these guys every damn class.   "Maverick!"
It's only been a week. Keep sending him up.
So have I.
The wings..
Yes sir.
Big gamble with a thirty million dollar plane!
ENGAGING THE OTHER GUY. WOOD, YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN.
I lost.
Talent is no holy shield. Von Richtofen was killed by a farm boy. Instincts are not enough. Do it our way. We've worked these things out. The good pilots can become better and the great ones can learn how to stay alive.    Why do you have to do everything the hard way?
All right.
I know. I was there.
Kid, the plain fact is...you are. I'm not gonna stand here and blow sunshine up your ass. Technically, they absolved you. You and I know what really happened. You pushed it. You are responsible and you'll always carry that. You know what, I'll carry it too. I should have taken you out of that cockpit. I guess I'm a hopeless romantic... I always try to find something worthwhile in someone's death. It's no trade-off. It's not one for one. What you learned isn't worth his death. It couldn't be. But maybe there is some value in it. I know it's the first thing I've ever seen that's really gotten to you. Now the question is, what will you do with it. If it gets you out of flight status...so you don't kill yourself or anybody else...that's good. That's one good thing. You were an accident waiting to happen.
Oh, the usual.  More money, more freedom, more air.
Freaks?...'Fraid so, man.  Goes with the territory.
Cheap domes.  And no air to screen out the rays.
But maybe you can change all that.
Thank you.
Don't take my word for it, Quaid. Someone you trust wants to talk to you.
No, sir.
Yes, sir.
Looks like another schizoid embolism.
Brunette.
I'm quite serious.  You're not here, and neither am I.
How much is Cohaagen paying you for this?
She's real.  I dreamed about her before I even went to Rekall.
Watch your mouth, Captain.
Relax, you'll live longer.
Yes, you do.  That's why we brought you here.  --  Cohaagen's big secret is buried in that black hole you call a brain.  And Kuato's  gonna dig it out.
Melina!
Oh, Rekall.
Yeah, you did.  I told you not to but you did anyway.
Harry, you're making a big mistake! You've got me mixed up with somebody else!
Up to the right.
Level 2.  Galleria.
Up!
All right, forget about it.
Lori, move.
Bye.
No!  Spies or something.  And Harry from work...Get down!
Mars?  You've never even been to Mars.
I swear to God!...I never saw you before six weeks ago!  Our marriage is just a memory implant -- agghh!
The job's real. -- But the Agency set it up.
I'm honored.
Bullshit.
I'm not interested in Saturn.  I said Mars.
I guess he didn't.
I didn't lose it.  Cohaagen stole it. He found out that Hauser switched sides,-so he turned him into somebody else.  Me.
Because you're still working for Cohaagen.
You never loved me, Hauser!  You just used me to get inside.
I used to model for 'em, why?
All sorts of things.  You might even remember you loved me.
The reactor.
The one in the mine!
What?
One of these days, Melvin, somebody's gonna kick your ass.
You can't fight'em that way...
I'd go for penetration.  The 458 shooting solids -- less ammo to carry anyway.
Well, I'm scared, but I'm not sorry.
The mountains are solid granite. We'd be safe there, and we could hike along them...all the way to Bixby if we have to.
Hell you did.  Your turn.
Do not talk to the driver.
Why?
In the past year I must've said a hundred times "We gotta get out of Perfection.  We gotta better ourselves."  You gonna stand there in broad daylight and tell me you think I'm the reason we're still here?  You want to know how close I am to going to Bixby right <u>now</u>?
That's the plan.
Damn straight!  Now there's nothing between us and Bixby but nothing!
You got that right.
Okay, the plan is: pedal to the metal the whole way.  We don't stop till we hit the carwash, not even to pee.
Well, there's sure as hell nothing to stop us now.  Everybody we know between here and Bixby is already dead.
Hey, I don't want spend the night out here!
Fifteen lousy bucks.
Then where's the goddamn Conway Twitty coming from?
That <u>is</u> the plan...I mean, goddamn it!  What the hell are those things?  How could they bury an entire Plymouth station wagon?
Little sons of bitches.
Maybe it is.  Why don't you take a little stroll and see?
Well, it's not like we've got a hell of a lot of options...
Jesus.  It's slower than hell.
Don't worry about me, jerkoff.
Jesus, Val, it's pretty far.
Road's in!  Now, soon as we hit Bixby we start making phone calls. We could make some real money off this whole thing, get in <u>People</u> magazine...
Civil?  I'm civil.
They're tearing down the houses here!  We all gotta get outta here together!  Now!
We have to go into Bixby in the morning.  The concrete blocks are in.
Just keep looking at that beautiful sky.
Around here?  Why would they?
They're working together, too.
Please... I need to sleep...
And one good guy.
Correct.
No it is not, Mr. Dowd.
I suppose I could find an inmate who'd say that Shu boasted about Chinatown just to survive in the joint -- though he didn't really do it...
-- I don't care who you are. You could've been killed. Every man and woman in here has done hard prison time. And we look out for each other.
Can't I take a simple piss without --
I can describe it.
No further questions.
Your Honor, the witness' response was non-responsive... I ask you to strike it from the record...!
Right, I forgot... We're pledged to protect every mid-level drug dealer in the Tri-state area.  It's an awesome responsibility.
Hey. You plan to be a criminal defense attorney, know this going in: Everybody's guilty.
-- Remember?
With two knives taped to his hands? Forget it, Rog.
We're taking the other case.
I feel much better now.
1530 Rivington Street.
Hey -- you believe what you want. Shu Kai Kim is innocent.
You know how I know? 'Cause Reynard says he's guilty, and Reynard's full of shit! Look --
I've got a meeting in Chinatown.
You phoned up Art Esparza's wife?
I've seen this picture before.
Least we'd already be at the Morgue.
Have you considered that Chuckie Roeder's not calling himself Chuckie Roeder these days? Get his mugshot from one of the many law officers who've got hotpants for you... then canvass those art supplies places. We're gonna win this one, Kitty, but ya gotta believe...
Eddie, if I wanted to make love with you again, I'd do it sober.
Screw you too, Kitty.
About Chinatown. What went down.
You tell me, man.
How can I tell you what I don't know!
It was self-defense.
By trusting me. Shit, man...
For awhile we had this dream we were innocent. That was our bond... but then we woke up. And now I'd like to hear everything.
No, s-sir.
But I'm a quick study. Tell your Deputy D.A. -- Rabin? -- that I'll see him in court.
Argumentative.
Objection.
The witness will substantiate Mr. Kim's modus operandi. It's circumstantial evidence in the case at hand!
I'd need a continuance. Three weeks at least.
Didn't this investigation, with its attendant publicity, catapult you into the office you now hold?
The same three detectives on the Jimmy Chin case.
-- Eddie told you?
Yeah, we do some of that.
That's right.
Blonde.
She's in high school. She's sexually active. She's on drugs. She's crying out for some help.
I want you.
Maybe our biggest. I'll see you two doors down from your place at 11:00.
Here he comes.
Baby laxative? We can't snort baby laxative.
What is the world coming to when you kill a guy for baby laxative?
Not tonight. Just give me something to take home to hold me over till tomorrow.
You're lucky I am not wasting you.
We've got our own clock. We'll lock up.
We're taking the body back to Portland and there's not a thing you can do about it.
Sam, get the body and put it in the van.  Sheriff Cable, where were you the night Teresa Banks was murdered?
I am going over here.
Chalfont. Weird. Chalfont was the name of the folks that rented the space before they did. Two Chalfonts.
COOPER, MEET THE LONG LOST PHILLIP JEFFRIES. YOU MAY HAVE HEARD OF HIM AT THE ACADEMY.
What?
No, sir, we did not.
Someone else has it now.
Ever see her with someone else?
Did she ever mention any friends?
What happened to her?
What do you mean?
Code. If you work with Gordon you learn that right away.
How do you figure?
Right, which is probably why Lil was wearing a red wig meaning we are headed into a dangerous situation. Let me ask you something, Stanley, did you notice anything about the dress?
Cole said she was 17.
In that case, we should go to the Canyon Trailer Park.
She must have known someone.
Thanks, Sam, for the good work. You have a good eye for detail.
I don't know what to do.
Faster and faster. For a long time you wouldn't feel anything. Then you would burst into fire... forever.
Okay, I suppose I should go home.
I know you are and you don't have to do anything crazy to prove it.
No.
What can I tell you?
I can't help you there.
And I love you, too. But don't wear my stuff.
Cause I like it.
No... hell, no. Just got in the truck, started drivin', looked down at the gauge and saw a big "E" starin' at me.
But Bob isn't real.
He's in love with a girl who's dead.  It is dangerous for you to have it. I'm sorry.
I couldn't it was Johnny Horne's birthday. I promised I'd be with him. I told you not to call me here.
How can I be together if I'm not together?
"Oh, Laura..."
What are you talking about? Bobby didn't kill anybody.
Sure honey, what's the hurry?
Ben asked him to stay late to plan for the Norwegians.
But my name isn't Leland Palmer.
Dad...
Yes.
You know, I did come home, come to think of it, on Thursday. I had a severe headache and I was driving in the neighborhood so I just darted in and out of the house.  Where were you, Laura? I didn't see you?
Stay away from me.
This is serious. Mr. Benjamin Horne's got a delegation of Norwegians coming in next week and I want both of you to learn to introduce yourself. Sarah, you first.
Laura didn't wash her hands before dinner.  And look at this.
Oh, I'll sit down, but none of us are going to start eating till Laura goes and washes her hands.
Lay off the bennies, Leo.
As if I didn't know.
Accused. Not indicted. He resigned the firm. Divorced nineteen seventy. Galvin worked with Michael Morrissey until Morrissey retired in 'seventy- eight. Since then he's been on his own. Four cases before the Circuit Court. He lost them all. He drinks.
You thought it was just.
Yes. It would be.
What does it mean?
No.
Yes.
You've just said you signed it.
After, after the operation, when that poor girl, she went in a coma. Dr. Towler called me in. He told me he had five difficult deliveries in a row and he was tired, and he never looked at the admittance form.  And he told me to change the form. He told me to change the one to a nine.  Or else, or else, he said...  He said he'd fire me. He said I'd never work again... Who were these men...? Who were these men...? I wanted to be a nurse...
Meth... Methodology and Technique...
Sir. Yes. When a thing is wrong... as in this case, I am available. I am seventy-four years old, I am not board-certified.
...almost nine minutes... causing brain damage.
Why wasn't she getting oxygen...?
That's right.
Well, we...
...We did everything we could...
Yes!
...I made a reservation at...
There's nothing they can do to me.
No, you did fine.
'Code Blue'...
Yes. I wrote it.
Yes.
She threw up in her mask, yes. But she hadn't eaten one hour prior to admission.
Negligent. Yes... it would have been criminal. But that was not the case.
You're going to settle out of court?
Why?
...that's perfectly all right.
She said she had a full meal one hour before coming to the hospital.
My client can't walk, your Honor.
Thank you for seeing me.
You should have taken their offer. Especially if you were unprepared.
Ready, your Honor.
No, no, you listen to me. All I wanted in this case is an even shake. You rushed me into court in five days... my star witness disappears, I can't get a continuance, and I don't give a damn. I'm going up there and I'm going to try it. Let the Jury decide. They told me Sweeney he's a hard- ass, he's a defendant's judge. I don't care. I said, the hell with it. The hell with it. I'll take my chances he'll be fair.
Overruled...
I changed my room at the Hotel.
The TV didn't work.
And what are you? A cop?
My ex-husband was a lawyer.
And are they going to get it?
I've got to work.
I... do you want me to leave?
I...
Who told you that?
Stop pressuring me...
No.
If you're selling something, I'm late for work...
Kathy Price.
My subscription lapsed three years ago...
I've got nothing to say to you.
Who says that I'm protecting anyone?
I don't owe them a goddamn thing.
...I understand...
Yeah.
What the hell do you think you're doing...?  What's going on here...?
One lousy letter eighteen months ago... I try to throw a fuckin' case your way...
I know what I said but not now. You won it. Franky. You won it. When they give you the money, that means that you won. We don't want to go to court -- is this getting to you...?
Admittance form is wrong.
I had a good teacher. McLean versus Urban Transport...
Oh shit, what's today?
I've got to go see Gruber.  What's the best cigars you have?
What did she do?
Come on, we'll get a cup of coffee...
Yes.
Yes, that's correct.
Should I?
That won't start no more fires.  We might's well go home.
Wait a minute - wait a minute!.... Bombs don't unscrew.
We'd be in all the papers!
There was a girl with them...If I could find her....
Forrester's the man behind the new atomic engines.  They had him on the cover of 'Time'.  You've got to rate to get that!
How can you say that when you don't know him!
They're really for long distance. When I want to look at something close...  I take them off.
There's only about one explanation for a thing like this..Got a pin?
Didn't you have something to do with this?  I know you sent word to the Sixth Army Command!
I bought it for the square dance. I thought I ought to wear some- thing Western.
It's gone now.
Don't you live at home?
But you're not going to.  You're not the kind.  You're tired, anyway.  You've been up all night.  You cracked up in a plane.  Slept in a ditch.  But you want to know something?  It doesn't show on you at all.
It's blocked here, too!  They've pushed up earth or something all around outside.  Here, this way...!
Yes, with these suits.  We've used them before on atomic tests... Odd- looking, aren't they?
You'll be all right with us....  ...for as long as anybody's got!
How could it happen to everybody's watch together?
It's pointing out to the gully - where that meteor came down.
I think that - gizmo - is a machine from another planet.
It might give us something.
It might give us time to search out some weakness in the Martians.
So is the town, I notice!
They'll probably move at dawn.
Well-l...how do you do, Dr. Forrester!
There's a square dance at the social hall this evening.
But they're not human!  Dr. Forrester says they're some kind of an advanced civilization --
D.O. to number three..come in.
So?
Yes, but...
I'm sorry.  At least we're in on piece.
You get any sleep last night?
Five earthquakes in three weeks is enough.
You've got to get back on the horse some time.  Look, you've had a nutcase making harassing phone calls.  I know how scary that feels.
48 hours.  Back before you know it.
Forget those two clowns, Heather.  Answer me, did you get another call from that guy or not?
I'll be there in three hours.
Sometimes what a child says or fantasizes will give a clue to what ails him.  Did he say anything while he was still lucid?
They are...it happened in tonight's quake.  It happened just fifteen minutes ago. You must've felt it.
He was just here!
What?
Rex?  Who's Rex?
Finish, please!
I like this story.
No.  Tonight.  It's important!
The mean old man with the claws.
Trying to get up...trying to get into our world.
No, I don't think so.  You just have to...pray, or reach...
Just because it's a love story doesn't mean it can't have a decapitation or two.
It's actually been giving me Freddy nightmares.
Quake knocked you off your feet.  You got bumped pretty good, actually. 
Six weeks of this, and you're surprised you've got Freddy in your dreams?  Hell, Sonny Bono says after a while he was seeing his stalker everywhere.  Even at Mass.
Where's Dylan?!  Have you seen him?
Hi.  This is Heather Langenkamp.
Big truck went right by before you opened the door.  Life on the Fault Line.
Thanks.  Just give them the time he called.  They're keeping a list, supposedly.  Sorry.  My nerves are so raw these days.
Sure.  We'll do an operation, Doctor Dylan and Doctor Julie. We'll fix him good as new.
By storytellers, of all things.  Every so often, they imagine a story good enough to catch its essence.  Then it's held prisoner for a while.  In the story.
Dramatically speaking it makes perfect sense.  You played Nancy, after all, the first to humiliate and defeat him.
No time like the present.  The car will bring you.
Coffee'd be nice.
I can take it.
He has a lot of hurt inside him.
Hey!  Weigh!  Blow the man down...
Give me some time to blow the man down...
Weight!  Hey!  Blow the man down...
Skipper, uh, the crew is pretty much doing group boot over the side.
We've got weather moving in from the west.
Skipper called us out of the rigging.
Yes sir.
Yeah, sure.
Well, Romeo here was on harbor watch and managed to sweet talk one of the local girls to have a go in the bowsprit.
That's what they get for not locking the door.
To take a piss.
You're not a moron.
What was that?
That's not why he's sending me.
Because it looks good.
It was a bad dream...
I gotta go.
Maybe it's an air raid.
Look, I appreciate, you know, the concern and all, but like he said, I can take care of myself.
Swear to God.  Only good advice he ever gave me.  Now, go back to sleep.
Jesus, you never told them?
What are you talking about.
Yes sir.
Speak up boy!
It was my fault.  I slipped.
You can't run from the wind son. You trim your sails, face the music and let the chips fall.  Bill, let's close her up, dog, tight.
I don't know.
So is violating international law.
No.
Let the blow drive the boat down wind.  Neutralize our canvas.
And, of course, we are.
I can take care of myself.
No.  Look, it's me okay?  Can't it just be about me?  For once?
It's okay.  I'll be in, in a minute.  Look, what do you want?
We're short one long boat too.  Come on.
She's Cuban.
That's enough.
Why'd you jump?
Come on, he didn't mean anything.
I've seen 'em.  I've seen 'em.
You will if you wanna eat.  Right George?
What is it... the secret?
Barometer's dropping.  The first blow'll come from the south.  Might get interesting.
Nobody aboard my ship is going anywhere.
No self respecting shark is gonna take a bite out of you.
You've gotta be kidding?
Excellent.  Bill, find Mr. Weathers a position to suit his condition.
Joy, rapture...
You already have.  Now go on.  Do it.
What?
You really felt that your crew were up for the conditions.
... and that you invited him to strike you?  To fight it out on the deck of your ship?!
Do you think this is funny?  Some kind of joke?  You lost six people out there.
The Coast Guard 'Eagle'.  She never lost a race while you were Skipper.
What's that supposed to mean?!
I was trying to get her up wind! That's what you do when you're hit a-beam.  Or maybe you're too stupid to know that!
Why? He's right in the groove.
No way... GET OUT!!!
No, haven't heard of it.
Hell, no, belongs to my girl's sister. The sister's been over to New Orleans, lets us have it while she's gone. Where's that pretty little lady of yours today?
Oil, gas, cattle, farmin'. Ain't nobody shows off around here. Iguana County's one of the richest in Texas.
When did you talk to Lula?
Like takin' candy from a fuckin' baby...
Wish I'd fuckin' cut you up good.
What's gonna happen when he sees me drivin' the car tomorrow?
Got enough, thanks. We're lookin' for a place has some music, where we can maybe do some dancin' - get somethin' to eat, too. Anything like that around here?
You say it's straight ahead a mile?
Thanks.
Sounds right... I'll check it out.
Not for lack of love, I can tell ya that.
Muchas gracias.
We were. Now Mr. San Pedro Sula and I are on our way back to Utila, in the morning.
Yes. Mr. San Pedro Sula spoke yesterday to his son, Archibald Leach San Pedro Sula, who is named after Cary Grant, and he told them there was a shooting.
Mr. San Pedro Sula's got an appliance shop.
Mr. San Pedro Sula's permit to kill.
United States Marine issue, before they made the unfortunate switch to the less dependable nine millimeters. I have it here, in my briefcase.
Woman drivin' down the street spotted me with on a roof with my rifle. She called the police and they came over and arrested me. Thought I was a sniper! Boys at the VFW loved that one. Cops didn't understand about the pigeons, the damage they do to personal property. I used to complain to the city but they never lifted a finger. I was gonna put out poison, but I was afraid somebody's cat would eat it. Hell, I had six cats myself. So I used the .22 because it didn't make much noise and the ammo was cheap.
Sailor... Lula loves you.
Yes, that's so. But there is not much to destroy.
Why not? How was the fishin'?
The real joke is we never went fishing, but we're still fishing.
Oh God... OH GOD... Santos... Oh God Marietta... are you in on this?... OH GOD!!!
Marietta, settle down now darlin'... I want what's best for her, too - like I said, I'll do what I can to bring her home.
I'm stayin' right here by the phone until you find Lula, then I'm comin' to get her. You call soon's you got somethin', even if it's three in the a.m.
Did I tell ya it's great to see ya again?
And to think what coulda happened in that king-sized bed tonight...
You ain't actin', mama.
Course he ain't never killed nobody. Why'd you say that, Pace?
'Bout fifty thousand times. I got us a room at the Cape Fear, and guess what?... I hear Powermad's at "The Hurricane."
I guess I started smokin' when I was about six... My mama was already dead from lung cancer...
How'd it happen, peanut? He just pull out the old toad and let it croak?
I can't hardly understand you when you talk with one of them Mores in your mouth.
One hundred twenty decibels - head on collision of a '54 Ford Pick-Up and a '64 Chevy Station Wagon. No survivors. Balls of flame and grinding metal.
You think of the weirdest damn things to say sometimes, peanut. Ain't we been doin' a pretty fair job this far?
It ain't altogether terrible just to let things go along sometimes. Lula, I done a few things in my life I ain't too proud of, but I'll tell ya from now on I ain't gonna do nothin' for no good reason. All I know for sure is there's more'n a few bad ideas runnin' around loose out there.
She got me an abortion...
You tell the boy who knocked you up?
What happened to him?
Well, like mama told me, Aunt Rootie, Dell's mama? She found cockroaches in Dell's underwear.
So?
There's worse things that can happen to a man, honey.
You up for that?
Poor baby. She don't know what she missed. What color hair she have?
You guess? My parole was broke two hundred miles back when we burnt Portagee County.
Thank the Lord. Well, you ain't let me down yet, Sailor. That's more'n I can say for the rest of the world?
What kinda trash talk is that?
That's disgustin'. Those kinda sentiments shouldn't be allowed out in public. Is this Biloxi yet?
There ain't no water in the swimmin' pool. Just a dead tree fell in, prob'ly from bein' struck by lightnin'.
Sailor? You expect me to believe a man'd be goin' around with a arm sewed to his nose?
Ever imagine what it'd be like to get eaten alive by a wild beast? Sometimes I think it would be the biggest thrill?
Shhhhh... It's four o'clock... That woman's laugh the other day had somethin' to do with this feelin'?... Like bein' ripped apart by a gorilla, maybe... Grabbed sudden and pulled apart real quick by a real powerful one.
We didn't do nothin' special I can remember. Just talked, is all.
Honey, we bein' strangers here and all, this is the kinda place we don't want to make nothin' of nothin'.
Leave me be for a minute? Mama gets all insane and then I see you practicin' your individuality and personal freedom with some oil-town tramp. How you figure I'm gonna feel?
That'd be good, Lula.
I can't take no more of this radio...  I ain't never heard so much concentrated weirdness in my life, Sailor Ripley, you find me some dancin' music right this minute... I MEAN IT!!
Well, we're really out in the middle of it now, ain't we?
I don't know, honey, but we gotta help that girl - get her to a town and hope no one catches on I broke parole.
You think she's gonna make it?
I'm afraid she is, baby.
Let's get a sandwich and find out about some work.
Maybe. Met a guy named Red, owns a garage, could have some work in about a week. Met a few hard luck boys who's stayin' here. What's that smell?
Lula, I got to get some sleep.
What makes sense, is all.
Why, how could I not worry? Not knowin' what's happenin' to you or where you are? Are you with that boy?
Are you comin' back here soon, Lula? I need you here.
You in a dance hall or somethin'? I can hear music behind you.
Argentina! Lula, you're outta your mind. Now you just tell me where you are and I'll come for you. I won't say nothin' to the police about Sailor, I promise. He can do what he wants, I don't care.
I am all right, mama. That's why I called, to let you know. I gotta go.
You ain't takin' Pace, though.
What time's Sailor's train get in?
I'm sure I wouldn't know, ma'am... and buffalo hunting too... hmmmmm?
Santos... It isn't.
Lula's gone off with Sailor.
I want you to take care of Sailor, so he won't ever be able to bother my baby again.
Yes... Get rid of him.
Shoot him.
Yes.
Yes.
Santos... I can't...
You fucker, don't you ever touch Lula - You fucker, I'll kill you.
What?
Someone's gonna see us.
Santos... You kill that Sailor, otherwise he's gonna turn my baby against me.
Got word the kids are moving through Texas... I think an ending is being arranged there... Come on, lemme see a smile.
Well?...
Yeah, but you gotta know what it's about, right? I mean, if you didn't know what it was about, why were you writing it?
We're going to the men's room. Only we might not make it in time.
Hhhuh. So we decoy her. Stick a couple pillows and one of your teddy bears under the spread and she won't know the difference.
Ah, right. Well, I gave you my opinion.
Your wife.
Perfect. Well then, shall we?
Isn't she?
It was Jerry Nathan's. He owed me money.
She left me. Crabs.
This morning. I found a note in the kitchen.
I think it's more complicated than that. Besides, he's a little... scattered. He almost... did something stupid tonight. At least, I think so. Anyway, he doesn't need sexual confusion thrown into the stew right now.
Vernon, then. Vernon Hardapple. The scar's are from a -- from a horse. He fell during a race and got trampled.
Because... because...
He heard everything we were saying.
What? Ohhhh. Is that... it?
His parents.
Competence.
What's to tell?
I told you. They keep him chained in the basement. Come on.
Hey, I heard all about it -- the parents, the grandparents, the China town thing -- and I believe you, okay? That's why we're here. Now go get dressed.
So what's the problem?
He said a few things that lead me to believe the car's his.
I just want you to know that's why I dropped your class and said all that shit about the university stealing my money and you being a pseudo- Faulknerian nobody.
That's probably not the problem, then. What about your lifestyle. Any major changes recently?
And your wife left you.
I spoke with the woman who saved your life. You're lucky she came along when she did.
You need to see a doctor, Mr. Tripp. An internist. And I think you really ought to consider seeing a therapist, as well.
A Manhattan book editor murdering a Mormon girl's clutch.
With Emily?
It's very convincing.
No! What gave you that idea?
She went crazy, Frances Farmer.
They really hated it. I think they hated it more than any of the other ones.
That's really it.
Like the lady herself.
He's dead, James. Believe me, I know a dead dog when I see one.
Does she want to hear it was one of her professors?
That's just what they used to say in the ads. Come on, Crabtree, I know you're holding...
Most of the time he is, James. Some of the time he isn't. Now what do we have here?
You're welcome.
I thought you might -- I don't know -- swallow your tongue or something.  I guess you really miss her, huh?
I guess there's probably a story behind that.
Sure.
Nothing, it's just that, well, it's been awhile since Arsonist's Daughter, and some people -- some of the kids in workshop -- thought maybe you were...
Well, James, you did shoot the Head of the English Department's dog and steal his most prized piece of memorabilia.
Maybe...
Didn't you say your Mom went to Catholic school?
She came here. We'll just wait. In the meantime, I need you to shimmy through.
It's not that. It just reminded me of -- you know -- of what's in the car. In the trunk.
Sure you do. You were thinking: 'That's no cap gun in that kid's overcoat.' You were thinking 'I can't let that kid get on the bus alone -- he might never get on the bus again.' You were thinking: 'I've got to find a way to distract this kid.' So you did. It was -- in its way -- a noble act.
Jealous? Of me?
The hell I am.
No thanks.
Yes, James.
Just checking.
Ail right. By the way, his friend...?
James'll know about George Sanders.
I thank you.
Some apartment somewhere. But I've never seen it.
The one in your office? It's the best one for naps.
Crabtree said it sounded like something James would be messed up in.
Who does?
I told you, Sewickly Heights.
That's funny. I need to talk to you, too.  Perhaps you could put some of these coats in the upstairs guest room, Professor Tripp.
All right. This morning --
Well. This is... surprising. Does Walter...?
Yes.
No. Maybe. I don't know. I don't know what I'm going to do.
Don't. I know what you're going to say.
It's -- it's a souvenir. Of Baltimore.
A twelve-year-old policeman came by the house this morning.
Really? That was fast.
I know that. I know what's at stake here...
I'm sort of helping him work through some issues.
I think I might've said I was in love with you.
Terry told me about Wonder Boys. Is it true? Did you lose it all?
Some times...
Jesus. Is that what he told you?
Yes?
GRADY Tripp. English Department.
I... I...
I'm in love with your wife.
Nevertheless, I'd like to see you in my office Monday morning.
Sick.
Hey, Professor Tripp.
I was thinking of you.
It's no Arsonist's Daughter, but I guess you know that. It's a young man's book. It got me remembering how it felt to be young.
Neurologist? Why? What's wrong?
Oh. Right. Linda... I haven't been doing a lot of sleeping lately. My editor's in town and I have the book to finish and --
A jockey? You mean, like --
I could be wrong. What happened anyway?
The perpetrator.
Just kidding.
Mr. Crabtree was saying how George Sanders killed himself, only he couldn't remember how.
You want to keep him happy.
Seems like the whole world's gotten younger.
Yeah, you still with Northland?
No way, man, you'd rob me blind!
How is she?
It was a beautiful present.
It wasn't like that.
I don't want to see any goddamn pictures.
I'm not a monster.
Sure.
I mean... feelings.
I can't.
I have friends.
Have a seat.
Why don't you just tell me?
You going to take me on a nature walk?
Woodsman?
Know what?
I'm adjusting okay.
How come?
Birds are my friends. That sounds egotistical, but they are. Birds know I watch them, but they don't mind because they like being watched... if they know you won't hurt them.
Would you like to sit on my lap?
Ms. Kramer.
Yes?
I don't mind.
I'm not running for Mr. Popularity.
Forget it.
I don't.
They usually tell me.
Then go see a therapist who will tell you you're normal!
I know --
Now I know. It's when I can see a girl, be near a girl, even talk to a girl... and walk away.  That's my idea of being normal.
I said I was sorry.
Why?
I'm relaxed.
I don't see --
Just lying there.  We're taking a nap.
All right.
Okay I'll tell you what I did -- just to shut you up!  I smelled her hair.
That's all. I just liked smelling her hair.
Yes.
Time.
Neither do you.
What do you think?
I like the noise.
Why do you want to know?
Don't tell me I'm not a fucking asshole when I know I'm a fucking asshole!
Maybe later.
I suffer from insomnia.
Hi.
I molested little girls.
How young?
Walter.
Don't be sorry for me. I did those things. No one else did. I'm dealing with that.
Sounds like a special guy.
Their power. They seduce me.
I was always the one seduced.
What?
You must hate your brothers.
No you don't.
Not ever?
Live together.
Do what?
I told him we had to get the umbilical unhooked ASAP.
Where're you?
No way that could just be seawater.
Yeah, yeah... yeah.  It's turning.
What is that?  You drop your dive light?
Kirkhill?  That guy doesn't know his butt from a rathole.  Hey, Perry!
Hey, you okay?
Yeah, okay.  Okay.
Not even when it meant something.  Is that One Night up in Flatbed?
Look, I didn't come down here to fight.
That must be it.
Yeah, what's-his-name wouldn't like it.  The Suit.
Bud, why are you doing this?  It's not part of you life any more.
No.
I can get power to this module and sub-bay if I remote these busses.  I've gotta get past the mains, which are a total melt-down.
I saw something!  I'm not going to go back there and say I didn't see it when I did.  I'm sorry.
Look, the guy's operating on his own, cut off from chain of command.  He's exhibiting symptoms of pressure-induced psychosis.  And he's got a nuclear weapon.  So, as a personal favor to me... will you put your tongue in neutral for a while?
It's trying to communicate.
Can we negotiate later?  There's Big Geek.
Wonderful.  There's some light from somewhere...
How?
Who then?
I'm not interested in your way of doing things. Just get your team ready to dive.
Check.  Then I just hang with these guys, right?
Now we're right in the middle of this big-time international incident.  Like the Cuban Missile Crisis or something.
Why bring it here?
Got it. Over.
Yeah!  I mean, I don't know... it looks right.
Yuh?
I can't... make it... podner.
Missed what?
Happy as hogs in a waller down there, prob'ly.
Right on!  Hot rods of the Gods.  Right, Lins? Hey, no really!  It could be NTIs.  The CIA has known about them for years.  They abduct people all the time.  There was this woman I knew in Albuquerque who--
Neutron counter's not showing very much.
You don't need to know the details of this mission... you're better off if you don't.
Check this out.
Perry, stand by on the ROV.  Sorry about this, little buddy.  Better you than me, know what I mean?
What's the timer set for?
Through three miles of water?   I don't know.
What could be more restful than this?...  Excuse me, what is it that you want to try?
I'm thirsty.
It's the same thing. Goodbye, dear.
It takes about twenty to twenty-two hours for the current to reach here from Lisca Bianca.
Look... I'd like to get back to Lisca Bianca.
All I said was that it sounds like a good idea.
And why do you tell us this only now?
But why don't you tell him?  A girl who was with us has disappeared.
Yes, maybe that is better.
Yes. I had also thought of going there to talk with them...
I have no desire to sacrifice myself... It's idiotic to sacrifice oneself... Why?... For whom? If Anna were here I might understand your scruples. But she's not...
And what about you?
As soon as you're ready, you can come down and catch up with me. I'll be waiting for you right outside on the square.
So, you wonder why?
Okay. In a few minutes.
Nothing.
Why?
I don't doubt it. But at a time like this we're the least suitable persons to be with him. And as far as telephoning him... Who knows where he is?
Why?
Better dead.
It was futile. We went all over.
You say that just to flatter me.
No.
What do you mean by sensible?
I imagine he must be inside sleeping.
More or less, we are all afraid. Especially at night.
I think all you have to do, Giulia, is to close the door.
Please, Giulia; must you always emphasize the obvious? I can see for myself that the weather is changing.
When one approaches fifty, my dear, he is affected only by the cold.
What has everybody got against me this morning?
Ask her.
Giulia, don't you understand that the more involved you become with people, the more difficult it is to speak with them?
But how could they pose like that? I couldn't.
Yes, sir. My sister is sick... and my father, too.
I tell you this acquaintance of mine knows you and she has often spoken to me about you.
Yes, she takes care of the garden.
No, not like this one.
Because this is a Chinese radio.
But for you, what comes first: music or love?
Ah, no... For me, love comes first. I'm a man, and I know what's what: first love, and then music.
Don't mention it... Pleased to be of service any time.
I don't see why I should mind.
If women's breasts were colored, yours would be blue...
You know, I don't love anybody.
Claudia isn't coming with us. Will you please take care of her luggage? Thanks.
He talked to you Himself?
Oh, for Heaven's sake.
... You needn't worry about being attractive here.
He loves you the way you are.
Why?
Yes, Mother.
It's not that... it's not that...
I don't know. I don't know what happened Mother, I woke up... there was blood on the sheets, but I don't know what happened.  I don't know what I did wrong, I don't know and I should be punished.
I don't know... I don't know...
Right now?
Oh, yes!
Oh, I know he does.
At least once a week.
Would you like to talk about it?
Why should they?
How were you sick?
After God... before the waste-paper basket.
Then let's talk about something else...
Would you like to ask them?
I can't have them any more.
I've stopped menstruating
From their mothers and fathers of course. Before that, I... I don't know.
Numbers... you can spend your whole life counting and never reach the end.
Where did you go?
No. There is nothing else. Just being here at night helps me sleep.
Somebody told her.
No.
Yes.
Not my fault.
Everything... I don't have children.
I'm not sick.
That's because you keep reminding me. If you go away then I'll forget.
Answer me!  You never answer me.
... makes me...
And then...
No I'm not.
As much as Mother Miriam does?
To help me.
Because I was afraid.
Yes.
May I open my eyes now?
Sister Marguerite I think.
What do you think it's there for?
Are you ill?
No... don't hit me please...
Agnes... Agnes...
Agnes who did you see?
She... left me alone with that little thing, and I looked at it, and I thought this is a mistake. But it's my mistake, not Mommy's. God's mistake.
Martha, all we're saying is, no-one wants this to come to trial, not the Church, not the Crown... least of all me.
Why?
And the sooner she goes to prison, the better off she'll be?
You're too involved Marty.  Jesus look at you. Why don't you turn this case over to someone else?
Look there are a lot of unanswered questions here.
You're getting to all of us Martha, let's face it.
It's gone on long enough. You're out.
Shut up, I'm trying to watch this.
Sister Anne, which was Agnes' room?
Yes.
I haven't a clue.
Obviously there was.
Why do you think that?
Well, it's been known to happen in the day too. Maybe Agnes went to him.
And you weren't shocked?
I haven't said anything against the the Catholic Church.
Then help her.
Nothing.
Yes.
I never saw Agnes until she set foot in this convent. My sister ran away from home. We lost touch with her. And when my husband died and I came here, she wrote to me and asked me if I would take care of Agnes in case anything happened.
Yes.
Oh God, if only I'd known.
Because I didn't know... 
I don't give a damn about her spiritual health.
Bullshit!
You just said...
Do you suppose the saints would have smoked if tobacco had been popular back then?
Listen to her singing.
Would it stop you if I did?
You think she's a saint?
She is an innocent.
Then why are you so obsessed with her? You're losing sleep over her?  You're thinking about her all the time. You're bent on saving her. Why?
Who?  That tun... that tunnel hasn't been used in fifty years.
I don't know... too late to stop it.
The scandal...
No!
I left it with her and I went for help.
Then she's a liar.
They are?
Y'what?
Well that's lovely talk, that is. And another thing, why aren't you at school?
Are you now?
Just you?
Ding Dong? Oh Ding Dong Bell, eh?
What they like?
How about Ding Dong?
Isn't it always the way? Picking on us little fellas.
They'll be here.
I'll have a bash.
Oh, you mean that posh bird who gets everything wrong?
Oh, yes, the lads frequently gather round the T.V. set to watch her for a giggle. Once we even all sat down and wrote these letters saying how gear she was and all that rubbish.
Have I said something amiss?
It is, y'know.
The old mixer, come on we'll have to put him right.
Oh, I'm sorry, I must have made a mistake.
If I let you have your own way, you little rascal, will you respect me?
You're getting out of hand. I don't know what's come over you today.
Well, it must be catching. He's given it to the champ here.
Something like that.
Aye well, actresses aren't like real people, are they?
Oh, I don't know, anyroad up, they never are, are they?
I only enjoy acting for myself. I hate it when other people are let in.
Why selfish?
Not really but I'm probably not a toffee maker. How would you do those lines of mine?
Well, I <U>am</U> living, aren't I?
Eh ... you're a bit old for that sort of chat, aren't you?
What?
Have they?
Oh, they seem all right to me.
Get Lloyd George over there with that mechanic in the cloth cap while I sort this lot out.
Every morning.
And I take a left-handed view of life, I've got to.
Here, Pauly.
What little old man?
Shurrup! Look, Mister, we've paid for our seats too, you know.
Shall I?
Can't he? He's done it, son!
That's right, but he's only asking us to pay attention to him, aren't you?
Ah, go on, you swine.
Hello the income tax have caught up with us at last.
We were going to do it.
Tonight? We can't make it ...
What?
Hello.
Well, yes your nose is. Very.
What have you heard?
Is it? Is it really?
Aah, shurrup, misery!
Don't exaggerate.
Sorry.
I don't need you to defend me, y'know, Norm.
It's not my fault.
Well, you don't have to rub me nose in it. I've a good mind to ... 
Well, give a couple of minutes ...
That's too easy for Lennon.
But John hasn't got any.
Oh ... he's nursing a broken heart.
Well ... if he's your Grandfather, who knows?
And they want me?
I'm an electrician, not a wet nurse, y'know.
Hell, we're equipped --
No.  Just some horrible dreams about smothering.  Where are we?
Dell, plot our location.
That's what I'm going to do.
I'll see what I can do.
Looks like a derelict.
What is it, I can't --
Yeah, but this is hard work.  Can't talk now.
Play it for us, please.
Unknown.
What?
That way.
It's monstrous -- it grew, like some horrible tapeworm.  We were completely unprepared.
Damn it!  How long to fix?
Oh -- I'm not near ready yet.
What?
Just hold us together till we're in space, that's all!
All right -- Roby and Melkonis will go with Faust.  Hunter and I will make up the second team.
Yeah, but how?  His nose and mouth are blocked.
How about cutting it off?  We can't pull it loose, but we can cut off everything but the bottom layer, where it's stuck to his face.
Boy, that's terrific.
Ask him.
I'll come with you.
Don't be an idiot.
The flamethrower needs more fuel.
I'm trying.
Oh... God...
Listen, hadn't somebody better check on Broussard?
How far?
<u>Don't touch him, watch it</u>!
Yes, thank heaven.
We're going into the freezers now.
I was thinking of a line from an old poem: "Water, water everywhere, but not a drop to drink."  All that space out there, and we're trapped in this ship.
All right, then -- when it gets to the other side of the door, you sing out, then drop the door.  Okay?
Just a second.  Those aren't water vapor clouds; they have no moisture content.
That tube must be depositing it in him.
Sandy, contact traffic control.
Computer, you have signalled a priority three message.  What is the message?
Any microorganisms?
What killed it?
Yeah, we hear you!  We're coming back!
He went into the pyramid alone.  We lost radio contact with him.  When we pulled him out, it was on his face. It won't come off, not without injuring him.
You bet we made it.  Martin, set course for Irth and accelerate us into stardrive.
We've got it up here!  It's trapped! Get up here fast!
The man would need protection, obviously -- as well as some way to drive the thing before him.
Then that tomb... must have been some kind of fertility temple... where they stored their eggs, and maybe held mating rituals...
... More spores coming.
Can we get to him?
Doesn't matter -- we're already at light speed.  And when we get back to the Colonies, they'll pick us up in the network.
Yeah... I forgot.
Now.  If we can get it into the boat, we won't have to blow it up -- we can just eject it into space.
Who gets the privilege?
What did it do to you?
I'll get you out of there.
What can I do?
Is it dead?
Oh man...
We're what!?
We're not gonna make it, are we?
Get her on-line.  Now!
Keep trying!
No, but I got something that might interest you.
We ran a trajectory simulation.  If they carry on along that path, it's possible they'll make intra-orbital insertion.
Seven minutes ago, the third course change in an hour.  Those incomings are going to skim past the communications platform just a little too close for comfort.
Do it.
Alright, let's keep calm.  We've got to have an option of some sort... there's got to be a way out of this.
Hey!  I was in shape before we started doing this.
Yeah, I got it.
What's wrong?
Where does that lead to?
Auto-shop?
Uh-huh.
How tight are these shafts?
Have you got an updated Lloyds' Almanac to cross-reff them through?
You've checked that end?
Looks like it.
Right.  When you've done that, don't waste any time getting out of there.  Once that crane starts moving...well, it's bound to provoke some kind of response.
Right.  Auto-shop, you all set?
Blow those suckers, Driscoll!
Not too much of the socializing type, then?
'We'?  You wanna fly out there with me?
Agreed.
Detour.  Other way's blocked...
What can I do?
Please do.
Even so. One isolated pretty good performance by an understudy. It'll be forgotten tomorrow.
That's right.
Yes. I do.
Are you that sure of tomorrow?
The setting wasn't romantic, but Lloyd was. He woke me up at three in the morning, banging on my door - he couldn't sleep, he told me - he's left Karen, he couldn't go on with the play or anything else until I promised to marry him... we sat and talked until it was light. He never went home...
Well, say something - anything! Congratulations, skol - good work, Eve!
I don't know what I take you for anything...
Not with me, you're no champion. You're stepping way up in class.
Very well, plainly and distinctly. Although I consider it unnecessary - because you know as well as I, what I am about to say.  Lloyd may leave Karen, but he will not leave Karen for you.
A dull cliche.
What of it?
She did like you, she helped and trusted you! You paid her back by trying to take Bill away!
Max has gone to a great deal of trouble, it's going to be an elaborate party, and it's for you.
You're being childish.
We all have abnormality in common. We are a breed apart from the rest of the humanity, we Theater folk. We are the original displaced personalities...
You were there? At the play - last night?
It's new Margo. But she's just as late as the old one.
It could only have been your natural timidity that kept you from mentioning it...
Being violently ill to her tummy.
Eve! My understudy...
Of course I knew.
Completely. Nor, I am sure, could anyone else present tell you how Miss Caswell read or whether Miss Caswell read or rode a pogo stick.
Tomorrow we meet at City Hall at ten-  - and you're going to be on time.
Everything... everything's so funny...
Eve. I'd forgotten they grew that way...
Everybody can't be Gregory Peck.
That I am...
A big hurry, be quick about it - so good night, darling, and sleep tight...
Sing it?
She hasn't missed a week since I left - but you know all that, you probably tell her what to write... anyway, I sent her a list of people to ask - check with her.
What?
See you...
You're in a beehive, pal, didn't you know? We're all busy little bees, full of stings, making honey day and night-  - aren't we, honey?
Cut it out.
You've heard it. About when I looked through the wrong end of a camera finder.
Clyde Fitch, thought you may not think so, was well before my time!
Stop calling her a kid! It so happens there are particular aspects of my life to which I would like to maintain sole and exclusive rights and privileges!
What about her teeth? What about her fangs?
What's all over?
The gong rang. The fight's over. Calm down.
Don't calm down.
Here we go...
You've been all through that with Lloyd-
I didn't know Eve Harrington was your understudy until half past two this afternoon!
I've been aware of that for some time.
I'll say.
You've had so many reasons for not wanting to marry me... Margo, tell me what's behind all this.
I understand she is now the understudy in there.
What would you like? Texas?
I'm going to have a home. Not just a house I'm afraid to stay in... and a man to go with it. I'll look up at six o'clock - and there he'll be... remember, Karen?
Why.
Goodbye, Mr. Sampson.
You shouldn't have had any doubts.
I'm for it.
Only thing, what I go after, I want to go after. I don't want it to come after me.
I know. She just keeps hearin' her dead father play the banjo.
They can always grab oranges off trees. This you can't do in Times Square...
Oh, brother.
Oh, brother.
Imagine. All this admiration in just one room.
Oh-oh.
Now you want an argument.
Like an agent with one client.
What for?
Subway.
I hope you don't mind my speaking to you...
He's the best.
Lloyd says Margo compensates for underplaying on the stage by overplaying reality...  ... next to that sable, my new mink seems like an old bedjacket...  ... you've done your share, Eve. You've worked wonders with Margo...
Nobody's done so much, Eve, you've got to stop thinking of yourself as one of the Hundred Neediest Cases... what is it?
Of course.
If I thought I'd offended her, of all people-
Well - if she's got to pick on someone, I'd just as soon it was me.
No, Eve, I won't forget...
I'm not crying.
- an understudy's performance.
He's not my friend. You were my friends...
I'll never get over it.
But not all of it - not that Lloyd and I are going to be married.
Thank you, Karen.
There was an item in the Times. i like the title. 'Footsteps on the Ceiling'.
'Remembrance'.
I hope so, Mr. Richards. Good night...
I could watch you play that last scene a thousand times and cry every time-
You certainly can. Especially if you're me between now and tomorrow morning...
There's the script to go back to the Guild-
- and those checks or whatever it is for the income tax man.
Hello, Miss Channing.
Hi.  "Well, now Mis' Channin', ah don't think you can rightly say we lost the wah, we was mo' stahved out, you might say - an' that's what ah don' unnerstand about all these plays about love-stahved Suth'n women - love is one thing we was nevah stahved for the South!"
Yes, it is! You're talented, famous, wealthy - people waiting around night after night just to see you, even in the wind and rain...
The heave-ho.
None in sight, there aren't many along this back road...
You're Margo. Just - Margo.
Bill's in love with Margo Channing. He's fought with her, worked with her, loved her... but ten years from now - Margo Channing will have ceased to exist. And what's left will be... what?
Well...
Lloyd says it's a publicity release...
Check.
Margo in the Cub Room. I couldn't be more surprised if she'd said Grant's Tomb.
Such as?
And you pose as a playwright. A situation pregnant with possibilities - and all you can think of is everybody to go to sleep...
Too many. And you've got a new guest. A movie star from Hollywood.
Not exactly. Sometimes, though, I wish I understood you better.
Twentyish. It isn't important.
Margo, you haven't got any age.
Just one person. Isn't that so?  You know what this is all about, don't you? It has very little to do with whether you should play "Cora" - it has everything to do with the fact that you've had another fight with Bill.
Perfectly innocent! Man have been hanged for less! I'm lied to, attacked behind my back, accused of reading your silly dialogue inaccurately - as if it were Holy Gospel!
Go ahead, please...
I love you, Max. I really mean it. I love you. Come to the pantry.
Margo, I wouldn't think of taking that girl away from you...
Well...
I don't know if this would be a wise move...
Are you threatening me with legal action, Mr. Fabian?
--they're all the same, all those Ivy League places--they teach you about striped ties and suddenly you're smart--
Let me lay a little theory on you--
--Hunt doesn't seem like your ordinary consultant.
--fifteen phone calls--
Why didn't we get that?
--she was panicked, Carl--every time I mentioned Watergate, you could tell.
I never scared anyone before.
It's safe, try it, you'll see.
And I'm a Republican.
When?
You voted for him.
That happens to people.  OK, go on.
You mean, who's going to play the mean M.P. and who's going to be the nice one?  Whichever.
Nothing--I just found out that Jeb Magruder from CREEP is a bigger bike freak than I am.  I never like it when the other guy's human...
We'd like to wait til we have all five before we print it.
--shit--
How high up, which Republicans?
The burglary was done by Cubans or Democrats or Republicans.
You asking would I have been one of the President's men?  I would have been.
What if I went up and introduced myself--think he'd slug me?
Maybe we are...
--Deep Throat won't confirm--I never thought he was scared of anyone, but he's scared of Haldeman.
John N. Mitchell, while serving as US Attorney General, personally controlled a secret cash fund that--
--according to sources involved in the Watergate investigation. Beginning in the spring of 1971--
Sir, I'd like to ask you a few--
11:30.
Whatever.
--Howard Hunt?
He is not in the car.  Sorry.
You can't.
They never told me anything except my own role--I had to find out the rest in the papers.
I didn't do anything wrong.
It gets interesting if it was Haldeman, because our word is that when Chapin says something, he's gotten the OK from Haldeman, and when Haldeman says something, he's gotten the OK from the President.
At USC, you had a word the this-- screwing up the opposition you all did it at college and called it ratfucking.  Ever wonder if Nixon might turn out to be the biggest ratfucker of them all?
--that was awhile ago--
And?--
--Deep Throat?--
If they ever start calling us goddamn liars--  --it's time to start circling the wagons.
--what?--
Lot of pressure at the Star.  Carl, when we got married, you were four thousand dollars in debt; when we split, you were solvent. That may prove to be the outstanding single achievement of my life, and now look at this.  How much did the damn bike cost?
This girlfriend of mine at the Committee, the other day she went back to the D.A. to tell the things the FBI didn't ask her. That night, her boss, he knew what she'd done. They control everything; that's how they know it all.
We're a long way from high school, Carl...  ...and I'm scared.
Just let me get a match.
I'm relaxed--light your cigarette.
--it was all in hundreds, wasn't it?
Could buy a lot of steaks, 350,000 dollars.
--they're worse. That's why I quit.
To cover up?
We're moving.  I've been looking for a job but it's been... hard. My name's been in the papers too much. Sometimes I wonder if reporters understand how much pain they can inflict in just one sentence. I'm not thinking of myself. But my wife, my parents, it's been very rough on them.
--Christ, I wish I knew if we should print this--
--you double-checked both sources?--
Ben, Jesus, there are over two thousand reporters in this town, are there five on Watergate? Where did we suddenly get all this wisdom?
How senior?
OK.  You're about to write a story that says that the former Attorney General-- the man who represented law in America-- is a crook.  Just be right, huh?
Electronic surveillance.
--I'm not here.
Absolutely--Marilyn's gotten it totally wrong--
If you don't like them, why won't you be more concrete with me?
To where?
Ratfucking.
Who?--be specific. How high up?
Total manipulation. I suppose you could say they wanted to subvert the Constitution, but they don't think along philosophical lines.
--don't concentrate on Segretti or you'll miss the overall scheme too.
Good God!
Security consultant.
--I'm Woodward.
I think so.
Some Justice Department lawyers and an FBI man, and some people from the Committee to Re-Elect, yes ma'am.
--nobody gives a shit about the Dahlberg repercussions--
Lotsa hints--
Could develop.
I don't get it--you were the one who wanted to fire him.
--go over your sources again--
Absolutely.
Maybe to fire you--since you two started on this story, the Post stock has dropped, what, 50 percent?  And the word is some Nixon people are challenging her TV licenses. I'm not saying she's going on relief, but I don't think it's unreasonable for her to want to meet you.
--well and good, but when will he say it on the record.
When so ordered.
One thing I'm not completely clear on--when you gave out the money to Liddy, how did that work?
Okay then.  The rest of you okay with that?
Finch!  Where were you last night? What happened to the foolproof plan?
Mochaccino.  Actually, in the spirit of the pact, I do need to ask for your cooperation in one small matter.
I believe the kegs are upstairs.
Whatever you hear about me, you agree.
You'll see.  Gotta go.  Sixteen minute round trip.
Yeah.  Right, uh-huh.  I feel like I've discovered this whole new side of me.  Music is so expressive.
I'm glad you think so.
That's nice.
Yeah, well my parents wanted me to go to Northwestern.  I didn't want to write all those extra essays they make you do -- I mean, how am I supposed to know what my "most emotionally significant moment" was?  So when my U of M acceptance came in December, I said the hell with it.
Oh, yeah.  So what're you gonna major in?
Oh thank God, I thought I was the only one.
Sure.
...it's okay, you should do whatever makes you happy.
No.  I'm missing the game for you.
No, that's not what I mean.  I mean -- look.  You know what made me leave that game?  Coach was giving this speech, about not slacking off when you see the opportunity to score.
I know, it sucks!
What the hell are you expecting him to drive to Vanderbilt for?  Milk and cookies?
Well...I'm pretty sure I've --
Then what the hell are you talking about?
Oh yeah, baby, I'll give it to you.
I couldn't tell -- She could've meant like, "I love you grandma" or "I love you Vanderbilt."
You know, I've never got that shit. What exactly constitutes third base?
No, you're stupid.  Get going!  Right now!  She's primed!
Holy shit!
She's already on a plane back home.
You fuckin' rule!
Yeah.
Oh, okay.  Here's let me show you.
Okay, okay.  I'll let you hit those books.
Is it because we have a test tomorrow? Sometimes I get cranky when I know I have a big test to study for.
Really?  You seriously want to go with me?
Are they gross or something, like guy stuff?  Tell me.
Yes!  And he was such a dork!  And everyone laughed at me, but I didn't care?  Because it was so funny!
Okay!
So do I, Kev.
Hang in there, buddy, you'll get there.
After getting laid?
Hey Sherman.  Scopin' the babes.
You've got something going?
Strip?
I am sorry, Jim.  I suppose we will not be doing any studying now.
God dammit, Stifler!
This just got a hell of a lot better.
I think "shithead" really says it.
How?
Just a second!
It's everyone's trick, Kevin.  But I did pick it up from you.
You want to do it?
I don't know.  How do you?
I love you.
What?!  How do I do that?
Well, no.  I think...I guess it would be good to be able to return the favor.  I mean, it would be nice to know she enjoys things as much as I do.
What's that?
Guys, guys -- you're ruining my fucking moment here.  Now think about it --
Dude, prom sucks.
Observe.
Yeah.  So you want double condiments on that?
Dude, he does not.
Keep it down, dude.
I'll bet you do, you little horndog, she's givin' you fuckin' stiffies, right?
Come on, you know the words, sing along.
No shit.
Thanks.
No way.
What a coincidence, I am someone!  Mmm. Calvin Klein's Obsession. Now it's mine too.
It's all in the tongue. Another bottle?
What, all of a sudden you got a degree in supernatural law?
Oh, big man. You can beat up a couple of cadavers. Well let me make something real clear, asshole. If you don't kill yourself, at midnight tonight you're gonna transform and murder innocent people!
It's a fucking nightmare, isn't it?
What?
Um... sort of... Maybe... It's all kind of blurry. We met at the club, then... Damn, that was some weird shit.
I was an Indian, actually. Man, that damn psycho paint...! If that's supposed to be mild, I don't want to know about medium.  The planet earth. It's good to be back.
Go to Jim Morrison's grave at Pere Lachaise. It's overrun with American tourists. I have to work.
Okay. But I'm back in half an hour.
Man! Our first date and already you're trying to get me to change! You French women work quick!
So tell me, exactly which truck driver did you study English with?
So's Woody Allen.  No, your uncle really helped me. I was sort of messed up for a while. Wasting my time just partying and... just stupid shit. He kind of woke me up, gave me a job, got me taking classes.  You know, he and Claude, their work is controversial, but they're serious about it. Totally dedicated.
Yeah. French fries...
You too.
You on drugs? Huh?
Shhh! Be quiet, man! We're not alone -
You'll never get the chance.
Bullshit! You're bluffing!
Looks like he lied to you too.
Oh shit... No...
This is... it's like a sick joke, I -
Yeah, well, why did he hang out here? The cops said it's dangerous -
I told him it wasn't ready...
Andy? Andy is that you?
AHHH!! The wine cellar!! In a bottle of Chateau Margaux. A metal cylinder... Don't... Don't - AAAAH!
But this is class kid, all the way. What a way to go.
Yeah, I know. Back to the Eiffel Tower.  And what about you?
I'm telling you. It's not drugs. It's something more. Someth -
I can't! At midnight tonight, he will kill again. It's crazy!
Your uncle was carrying this. The keys to his apartment are in there. I talked to his assistant, Madame Flocquet. You'll be staying there a while?
Double merde.
I was showing Sonya something . . .
How to read.
No.  I'm running <u>to</u>.
Then come find me.
She's quite right, Dmitri, a man of my stature should not have to
I'm fine.
Who's Sophie?
Yes, your highness.
I'm sorry. . .  I'm. . .
What happened to your parents?
You know, it's strange - Anastasia's grandmother, the Dowager Empress Tatiana has been looking for Anastasia since the revolution.  Why do you think she wouldn't go to her own grandmother?
Natasha! Natasha Feastavich!- but we called her Nashie Fooshie!
It's the best fork of all
Don't be
I don't know! I don't want to hurt you...
THINGS MY HEAR USED TO KNOW THINGS IT YEARS TO REMEMBER
You can't go back to find your home. Your home is in your heart, in the future that you make for yourself.
Oh my God!  Don't do that ... feel my heart. Go ahead. I'm dying here ...
How do you know?
She leads a charmed life, that little one ... Someone is always there to save her. In the palace as a child, on the train and now ... it's him.
He's her?
Royalty do not help people with their luggage.
Pray he's color-blind...
What do you mean?
Watch me.
I should go
Oh, heavens - I must say, yes.
No. Yeah, once in a while. You know, like occasionally.
Alvy Singer over here!
M'mm.
Okay, if that's all that we've been through together means to you, I guess it's better if we just said goodbye, once and for all! You know, it's funny, after all the serious talks and passionate moments that it ends here... in a health food restaurant on Sunset Boulevard. Goodbye, Sunny.
Yes.
Well, why not?
You're using this conspiracy theory as an excuse to avoid sex with me.
I-I-I mean, I'm comparatively normal for a guy raised in Brooklyn.
It's always some kind of an excuse. It's- You know, you used to think that I was very sexy. What... When we first started going out, we had sex constantly... We're-we're probably listed in the Guinness Book of World Records.
M'm.
Oh... no, no, no, no, uh, uh. No.
Hi. Oh, hi. Hi.
Me? Oh, downtown!
Oh, I'm in her acting class.
Do I drive? Uh, no, I gotta-I gotta problem with driving.
Yeah.
Yeah, my grammy.
I know, it's pretty silly, isn't it?
Hey, well, listen... hey, you wanna come upstairs and, uh... and have a glass of wine and something? Aw, no, I mean... I mean, you don't have to, you're probably late and everything else ...
Okay.
Y-y-yeah, just for fifteen years.
Sadie? Oh, well, Sadie...  Sadie met Grammy through, uh, through Grammy's brother George. Uh, George was real sweet, you know, he had that thing. What is that thing where you, uh, where you, uh, fall asleep in the middle of a sentence, you know-what is it? Uh...
Oh, really? Oh, well... uh, uh, maybe, uh, maybe, we, uh...
'Cause I don't like to get naked in front of another man, you know-it's, uh...
'cause, uh, you never know what's gonna happen.
You know, I gotta get there and begin whining soon... otherwise I- Hey... well, are you busy Friday night?
No, so help me.
you're gonna like night clubs, they're really a lotta fun.
What?
Yeah.
Yeah... oh, uh, and I'm gonna have a pastrami on white bread with, uh, mayonnaise and tomatoes and lettuce.  Tsch, so, uh, your second wife left you and, uh, were you depressed about that?
M'hm. Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah.
Oh! Italian, right?
Oh, yeah?
You are extremely sexy.
Do I love you?
Well, I mean, I'm moving in with you, that's why.
Well, okay. Well, listen, I'm gonna get a cigarette, okay?
Well, have you ever made love high?
It relaxes me.
Yeah, but that's not-that's no good. I want the whole thing.
Well, it ruins it for me if you have grass  because, you know, I'm, like, a comedian-
C-c-coll- College audiences are so wonderful.
Are yuh?
Well, the twelve o'clock show is completely different than the nine.
I didn't follow you!
Paranoid? I'm looking at you. You got your arms around another guy.
We're not having an affair. He's married. He just happens to think I'm neat.
Who cares? Who cares?
David? You call your teacher David?
Me? I'm-I'm one of the few males who suffers from that, so, so... you know.
M'hm.
Tsch. Rea- All this happened in the first hour?
I whine. I-I-I sit and I whine.
Tsch, what'd the doctor say?
And, Alvy... and then I told her about how I didn't think you'd ever really take me seriously, because you don't think that I'm smart enough.
And what are you doing following me around for, anyway?
I just think we oughta call this relationship quits!
Oh.
My God, I mean, you know how I am about insects.
I got the good chocolate, Alvy.
It's for my complexion.
I don't know.
Holy cow!
Ah? Oh, well, your birthday's not till tomorrow, honey, I hate to tell yuh.
But the thing is-I mean, since our discussions here, I feel I have a right to my own feelings. I think you woulda been happy because... uh, uh, I really asserted myself.
I don't know, though, I feel so guilty because Alvy is paying for it, so, you know, so I do feel guilty if I don't go to bed with him. But if I do go to bed with him, it's like I'm going against my own feelings. I don't know I-I can't win.
Sometimes I think-sometimes I think I should just live with a woman.
Yeah, I know it's sick, but it's new. You know, you didn't say it couldn't be sick.
It's that they don't throw their garbage away. They make it into television shows.
I'm cool.
Yeah, she's got a great-lookin' fa- A pat on the androgynous side. But it's...
Tsch, I know. A relationship, I think, is-is like a shark, you know? It has to constantly move forward or it dies.  And I think what we got on our hands  is a dead shark.
Well, uh, Alvy, you wanted to break up just as much as I do.
Remember that day?
Well, whatta you mean? I mean, it's perfectly fine out here. I mean, Tony's very nice and, uh, well, I meet people and I go to parties and- and we play tennis. I mean, that's... that's a very big step for me, you know?  I mean...  I'm able to enjoy people more.
Alvy, I can't say that that's true at this point in my life. I really just can't say that that's true. I mean, you know how wonderful you are. I mean, you know... you're the reason that I got outta my room and that I was able to sing, and-and- and, you know, get more in touch with my feelings and all that crap. Anyway, look, I don't wanna- Listen, listen, listen, uh  h'h, so whatta you up to anyway, huh?
I thought just earplugs.
No jokes-these are friends, okay?
You have a raccoon?
He's God! I mean, this man is God! He's got millions of followers who would crawl all the way across the world just to touch the hem of his garment.
Yeah.
It's unbelievably trans-plendid! I was at the Stones concert in Altamount when they killed that guy, remember?
This is, uh, Shawn, and, uh... Bob and Petronia.
Trigger.
I'm not myself since I stopped smoking.
Whatta you mean?
Since you put it that way.  It's hard for me to refuse.  ...have a, I have a terrific problem with authority, you know. I'm... it's not your fault. Don't take it personal.
We move to sunny L.A. All of show business is out there, Max.
Right, right, so g-get back to what we were discussing, the failure of the country to get behind New York City is-is anti-Semitism.
But the- I'm not discussing politics or economics. This is foreskin.
Max, I've got a hit series.
Oh, no, no, that's bullshit, Max. He goes with that girl over there.
V.P.L.?
I'll handle it. I'll handle it. Hi.
We're gonna operate together.
Then there was Jerry, the actor.
Hey, listen-I mean, he was a terrific actor, and look at him, he's neat- looking and he was emotional... Y- hey, I don't think you like emotion too much.
We really had a good time.
Oh.
Oh yeah, stay here? U-huh.
I was a great beauty.
And how's the diva doing?
She's got great tits.
You're coming swimming in the pool, and in a few minutes you won't even remember what it's about.  You won't care who's in your damn movie.
Pictures.  They're always in my tote.  I left my tote in the damn trailer.  But! He's Mac all over again.  Imagine Mac shrunk to two-and-a-half feet.  The fact is they probably didn't even need me for this birth.
And you're not the wife.
Damn straight.
Fuck you.
What a nose.  You missed your calling.
I'm not so sure.  Look again in three months.
When does he graduate high school?
I love you, Joe Therrian.
Harry called.
Excuse me?
You have?
You're crazy baby.  I love you.
Hm.  We should do it again.
Hm.  You think we should ask them for their landscaper?
Hey!  Would you?
Man, I must really be stoned.  Thanks, buddy.
Probably not.
I love you, you're a genius.
We've only been over this how many times?
There's still time to undo this.
Just do what I say, alright?
I'm ready.
Oh, well, we'll just have to try again. Sound like a plan?
In the morning, after everyone's gone and there's just us.
For good.
They can't find a sitter...  Hello?  Excuse me?  Yes, uh, hold on.  Just a moment.  It's Skye Davidson.  She needs directions to the house.  You invited Skye fucking Davidson to our anniversary party?
I'll say as little as possible.
You've got Cal.  You've got Gina.  You've got Skye?  We're the leftovers.
Dinner.  Don't be angry.
It's ecstasy, Sal.
Oh for fuck's sake.  Nobody uses that gate.
Well he can't have gone far.
He'll find his way back.
Or shitty!!  Otis!!
Otis!
Just stop right there, Sally.  We've been through this.
Sally, first of all, you're talking bullshit.  And second...
Every novel I've had published in every language I've dedicated to Lucy.
Hello?  Last birthday was?
Your director and your co-star of your current movie.  Don't dish if you can't take it, Sally.
Don't push me away.
Don't do this!
Me too.
Come on, Panes...
Nothing that can't be exchanged.
Oh my God, I'm a huge Skye Davidson fan. She's very beautiful.
But I am right, yes?  She's based on Sally.
Still.  Well.  Let's drop it.
He's the best dog in the world.  They're both coming tonight.  Not my idea.
Yeah, we're in a constant state of flux.  I see you've moved up from the soft stuff.
No you're not.
Hm.
Very well put.
Alright.  Please don't tell Ryan I'm drinking.
You're never too old for a lolly.  I'm having one.
You must have been a baby.
Oh, I love that.  I'm just great.  I'm so happy to be here. And I apologize for invading you.  And I'm so happy you asked me to.  I'm so touched.  I know how private you and Sally are.
When I read your work I felt that you knew me.  Women must tell you that.  And this one in particular speaks to me, do you know?  I am Genna.  How many women must tell you that.  And the script is wonderful.  Wonderful and lean and visual...
Trust him.
No, it's not... Fuck fuck fuck fuck.
You need a good review and you'll be fine.  The whole color of the world will change, mark my words.
Don't go in, Ryan.
Yes.
Really??
I just did a movie about Bob Yar, I played Gittle, the Jewish milkmaid who gets shot in the head, and they used Shostakovich's 13th Symphony.
Not enough.
Really?  I need a drink.  Come hide with me.
It's not ruined, for fuck's sake.  It's one of your parties.
I wasn't finished.
"We can't stand seeing you like this, Panes.  I hate you being alone.  Why don't you stay with us for a while?" "I'd love to, thanks."
At 4:30 today he barked for a solid fifteen minutes.  I have it on tape.
Oh.  Well, yes.  It's extraordinary.  You think you could sign it for us?
What are they?
I don't mind...
Would you like to meet my husband?
So how much do you hate her?
Honey, I'm not worried about you.  You are going to be a fantastic mom.  Not an issue.  I pressed you, remember?  Joe, on the other hand, is a different story.
He wants playmates.  Oh he's a sweetheart, Sal, you know I love him. But he's not going to be a good father. He's just not parenting material.
And Cal's this massive adult?
We're fine.  We're great.  We're having a baby and we're moving to London.
Z, old pal...  SHUT UP!!!  It's bad enough there's a food shortage without you complaining about it every day.
No, Z.  The squeaky wheel gets <u>thrown</u> <u>away</u>, alright?  You're a good ant, Z, even though you are a pain in my rear- segment.  I don't wanna see anything happen to you.  So quit mouthing off, before you get in trouble.
This colony needs another tunnel like a hole in the ground.  Why are we even digging this thing?
No -- I mean yes -- I mean -- if you don't have other plans.
Very well.  Carpenter, is there a convenient time to talk vis-a-vis: relationship?
Wait!  When can I see you again?
I CAN'T DANCE WITH A WORKER!
SSHH!!!  SSHH!!!
Alright, alright, I'll try to get directions from one of the locals.
Who's the bigger idiot -- the idiot who gets kidnapped, or the idiot who lets herself get kidnapped by the idiot?
Water...water -- oh, you already said that.
Cut me down a soft leaf so I can take a nap.
Hlllllllp!
Five thousand three hundred and ninety -- no.  About five thousand four hundred by now.
Just looking for fun, adventure, trouble, I guess.
You held onto this all that time?
There's something going on, Z --
I'm the Princess, aren't I?
Then if I go to the worker bar, it isn't improper.  Anyway, don't worry. No one will recognize us in our disguises.
I just joined up.  But I'm quitting! I got a trial membership!
Yeah.  Well -- no.  She's kind of playing hard to get.  As a matter of fact, she's playing completely unattainable.  So, what's on the schedule?  A brisk walk?  a foraging expedition?
Our platoon has the best assignment of all.  We're the first into battle!
Superior numbers, kid!
I've never seen anything like it, General, they're they're...well, look!
Well, uh, who notices workers, sir?
That's correct, sir!
No, sir!
Dammit, I'm proud to be an ant.  And I know each and every one of you boys will do your duty.  Dismissed.
So...you two are in love?
Oh, of course --
They should be...  But there's something funny about that soldier.
But -- but I've always felt life was about finding meaning...and then sharing it with someone special, someone you love.
And all the time I've known you, you've been grumping and groaning. You should quit making waves.  Go with the flow.
I'm not in the mood.  Even when they're off work, they follow orders.
Maybe I'll get lucky.  You know, Z, I wouldn't do this for anyone but you...
You're a real buddy.
What do I do?
Yeah.  How much?
That's right.  Maria Ouspenskaya. BLONDE  Hiya, Ouspenskaya.
From me the doctor has no secrets. Poor girl -- how could you do a thing like that?
Well, I have some paper towels --
Care to make a small wager?
Shall we say -- a dollar?
It was making me nervous, so I chopped it off.  Big mistake, huh?
Why?
You may not realize it, Miss Kubelik, but I'm in the top ten -- efficiency-wise and this may be the day -- promotion-wise.
Really?
I'd love to hear them. Maybe we could have lunch in the cafeteria sometime -- or some evening, after work --
Good night.
I almost didn't recognize you -- this is the first time I've ever seen you in civilian clothes.
Well -- I could meet you at the theatre -- if that's all right.
Eight-thirty!
Thank you.  I thought you were avoiding me.
In the last six weeks you've only been in my elevator once -- and then you didn't take your hat off.
You shouldn't.
I thought so.
Of course not.
Much better.
I'd better get back to my elevator. I don't want to be fired.
You don't want me here --
I just want to go brush my teeth --
Well, I haven't figured it out, exactly.
Someone from the office.
I mean -- her apartment.
He doesn't give a damn about me.
I'm not very good at it.
Yeah -- I know what you mean.  Queen.
Three. The last one was manager of a finance company, back home in Pittsburgh -- they found a little shortage in his accounts, but he asked me to wait for him -- he'll be out in 1965.
You really think so?
Pick up your cards and let's go.
So they'll shoot me -- like a horse.
Who'd care?
Why can't I ever fall in love with somebody nice like you?
For me?
Oh.
I guess so.
I wouldn't say that --  What would you like to have for diner? There's onion soup and canned asparagus --
You did?
Where?
That's terrible.
Are you just making that up to make me feel better?
No -- just come as you are.
You ought to see my backhand.  And wait till I serve the meatballs. 
I don't?
That's funny -- so am I.  What did you do with the cards?
No, no.  Just waiting for a friend. Good night, Mrs. Lieberman.
All that marching -- tramp, tramp, tramp -- you were having army maneuvers maybe?
Yes, sir.
Well, you know how it is -- things pile up.
That's very flattering.
There's a certain key floating around the office -- from Kirkeby to Vanderhof to Eichelberger to Dobisch -- it's the key to a certain apartment -- and you know who that apartment belongs to?
Just those four -- out of a total of 31,259 -- so actually, we can be very proud of our personnel -- percentage-wise.
Oh, it won't. Believe me. And it's not going to happen again. From now on, nobody is going to use my apartment --
West 67th Street. You have no idea what I've been going through -- with the neighbors and the landlady and the liquor and the key --
Swap them? For what?
Yes, of course.
Oh, yes, sir. Very much. And I want to thank you --
Fine. And I want you to know I'll work very hard to justify your confidence in me -- SHELDRAKE Sure you will.  Say, Baxter, about the apartment - now that you got a raise, don't you think we can afford a second key?
I know how it is.
Good. Is there anything you need -- money -- ?
How's that again?
Just following doctor's orders. I've decided to become a mensch. You know what that means? A human being.
All we were going to do is eat and wash the dishes --
Instead of Friday -- could you possibly switch to Thursday? You'd be doing me a great favor --
Oh, I'm very grateful.
So long, fellas. Drop in any time. The door is always open -- to my office.
Now will you get out?
I'm all out of liquor -- and there's no clean glasses -- no cheese crackers -- no nothing.
Yes, Mr. Dobisch.
I have a vague idea.
Listen, Baxter, we made you and we can break you.
Look, Mr. Vanderhof -- I've got you down here for tonight -- but I'm going to be using the place myself -- so I'll have to cancel.
Yeah.
Hi, Doc.  Had a late call?
I'm sorry if it gets noisy --
Mister -- Miss -- such politeness!
Just as long as she's okay.
I don't know what you did to that girl in there -- and don't tell me -- but it was bound to happen, the way you carry on. Live now, pay later. Diner's Club!  Why don't you grow up, Baxter? Be a mensch! You know what that means?
She may be a girl -- but she's no friend of mine.
It's an emergency -- see you some other time.
Nothing.  Just clear out, will you?
Who?
Why not? We don't owe Buddy-boy anything.
Hit by a swinging door? Or maybe a Yellow Cab?
That's right, Fran. And I'm a doctor.
You can't sleep.  Come on, Fran -- open your eyes.  Let's get her walking. We've got to keep her awake for the next couple of hours.
I beg your pardon? MISS OLSEN I'm Miss Olsen -- Mr. Sheldrake's secretary.
So you don't have to play innocent with me. He used to tell his wife that I was the branch manager from Seattle -- four years ago when we were having a little ring-a-ding- ding.
Six weeks. But who's counting?
-- same sauce -- sweet and sour.
Let's not start on that again, Jeff -- please. I'm just beginning to get over it.
Not here, Fran. Can't we go some place else?
Just trust me, baby -- we'll work it out somehow --
Handle what?
Yeah, we better.
Sure. Monday and Thursday -- and Monday again -- and Thursday again --
Atlantic City?
Ring out the old year, ring in the new. Ring-a-ding-ding.
Sssssh.
I'm sorry, Jeff. You know I could never hold my liquor --
Oh -- oh!
I like all of them --
That's what there is to talk about -- my man -- I take a good care of my men --
I will -- I assure you that -- You got a fifty on that H-34 -- leave the ammo in boxes -- I'll get my men to bring the first drum with 'em --
Moonby. Got any Winstons?
Moonby, 4th battalion, Royal Australian Regiment, Task Force. Ex-Corporal Moonby, deserted.
No.
Tracks ?
At least you always have enough water. How many gallons does each one of those damn things carry ?
Who are you ?
Then went too far -- he sat there and starts mutilating the centerfold. Poking pins in her an' all that. Sergeant says, don't do her like that. You leave your shitty little hands off that girl. Gook Lieutenant says Fuck you in Vietnamese -- Sergeant says, don't do that again. You'll wish you hadn't. Then he stood up, flicked his iron to rock and roll and gave the little zero a long burst through the Playboy mag. Man, it blew him clean off the dock -- Hell, just the magazine was floatin' there all full of holes.
They lined us all up in front of a hundred yards of prime rib -- magnificent meat, beautifully marbled.. Then they started throwing it in these big cauldrons, all of it -- boiling. I looked in, an' it was turning gray. I couldn't stand it. I went into radio school.
Probably is.
Looks that way.
Not a thing.
Where ?
The draft of that river might be too shallow on the point.
I'll go with him --
When'd you do it?
What is it?
If they have boats ... or canoes... they'd get lost in the fog. We can't move either -- we'll end up on the shore.
Which way? Right or left?
I wonder if that was the same copter.
If you're B.L. Willard, 4th Recon Group, we'd like you to come with us.
Ours.
Exactly -- you'll go up the Nung River in a Navy P.B.R. -- appear at Nu Mung Ba as if by accident, re-establish your acquintance with Colonel Kurtz, find out what's happened -- and why. Then terminate his command.
What is it?
Colonel Kurtz, he's dead.
As I said, we can pay you in gold.
Of course. I -- Once we make our repairs, we could send word, we could have you evacuated from here.
You'll get blown outta here some day.
The Vietnamese think it's theirs -- I guess the Americans do, too.
That's right, sir.
I got bored in Saigon.
I met him.
You'll find enough Cong up there.
Yeah.
You can't have water after morphine.
How's the pain?
Fuck no.
What are you doing?
I'm taking you back.
You get to know each other pretty well out there.
Both of us...
What?
Which one's the Colonel's?
A Yater spoon is hard to get -- especially here.
Sure.
It's a feeling you get in the jungle. When you get good, you can find a track and tell not only how many they are, but their morale, how far they're going, whether they're near their camp, the weapons they're carrying.
I wasn't looking.. I was running.
No -- leave it --
What is this bridge?
Where's Kurtz? I want to talk to him.
Why did they attack us?
His name is...
I should be checking on the boat.
No. Not really.
Kurtz.  I know you've heard of him.
Then Philippe will have to kill all of you.
Anyone got a card?
Wait 'til I'm across!
134  CONTINUED:  
There isn't one, unless Corbett's men get here before the plane does.
Question is why they sat here when the storm moved in.  Check their stuff while I sniff around.
28   CONTINUED:
Back against the bars.  Now.
Six months.
I don't want to talk any more.
I have not, but I very much want to.  What do you know about the trouble in Devil's Cauldron?
The radio's on the fritz.
Can't help myself.  Corbett's type always pisses me off.  Oh, I found this at the post office.  Had your name on it.
Let's keep going.  We're only an hour from Devil's Cauldron.
I know.  Least you didn't shoot all of them.
New to the country, kid?
Yeah.  Maybe so.
-- Killing is what you know.  Pack some food while I prep for the flight.  I'm sure not gonna let him go.
Smart?  Sure.  That's why I'm sitting in this plane and they're down there blowing me kisses.
I'm right behind you.
You don't get it, do you?
Told that's what our old man was. Planned on going to sea, me and Bob, 'til I read Jack London. Started trapping when I was ten. Mailed the furs to Sears.  Eight bucks for a skunk, three for a muskrat.  That was fine money.
Yeah, it is fucked up -- but it's not too late to keep that from happening here.
Don't bet on it.
You kill me, you sign your death warrant.  And hers.
You're wrong.  Everything we do leaves its mark.  You said it yourself -- there are hundred- year-old footprints in the tundra.
Ben...boys.  Yeah, real slow, and I'd like to keep it that way.
No, I better stay at my post.
But I would.
You left a footprint at the Sportsmen's camp.  Only pretty sight there, Ben, 'cause the two men you didn't shoot and mutilate died of exposure.
If that was all, fine.  But carving him up, stranding the others, that's too fucking much. Is everything that walks, crawls, flies or swims fair game to you?
Don't try me.  I'll kill you if it comes to it.
Nothing personal.
-- Forget it.  And try not to bleed on my throw rugs.  Why do this?
Have you heard anything from the girl staying with me, Anne Marie?
Look, Neff, I've got Ben Corbett with me --
Yeah.  Sorry I barked at you last night.
-- Sam Wilder was my cousin. He's why I came to Alaska.  All his letters, saying what a paradise it is.  But me ending up dead won't do Sam a lick of good.
Any idea who could've done it?
That's what we should've done in the first place.
I just as soon he stay gone. Fool could've got us all killed, arresting Ben Corbett here in town.
Dixie's waiting at the infirmary. She'll put a splint on that injured leg.
Goddamn!  Viking Bob!  Mitchell's inside, boring bastard...
Ease off.  We do this my way.
Sit your suspect out in the cold. He'll keep.
I don't need one 'cause I know what's really going on here. I have to finish this letter or I'll go nuts.  This can't be right -- con- science.
Go ahead.
Stop treating this like I'm going away with a man. He's just going to say those crappy, sick, complaining, angry things to me. I hate this, Mom -- I hate this. He's a freak show -- the worst person I ever met.
Everybody wants that, dear -- it doesn't exit...  Sorry... didn't mean to interrupt.
Stay out of this...  Doctor?
He's in the bathroom...  He's fine.
Fucking H.M.O. bastard piece of shit...  I'm sorry...  forgive me.
His home number.
I've got Jews at my table.
I see the help -- judgement call.
You all set here?
Are you totally gone? This is my private home...
No!!! Stay away from me!
Well, part of what I said in this entire history of my life which you won't read is that somehow you've done more for my mother, my son and me, than anyone else ever has... And that makes you the most important, surprising, generous person I've ever met and that you be in our daily prayers forever.
Thank you.
Two days.
Oh.  We might. Yes. We can. Let's.
Melvin, pay me a compliment... I need one and quick... You have no idea how much what you said just hurt my feelings.
Can we order first?
Don't be pessimistic. It's not your style. Okay... Here I goes... Clearly a mistake.  I have this -- what? Ailment... And my doctor -- a shrink... who I used to see all the time... he says 50 or 60 percent of the time a pill can really help. I hate pills. Very dangerous things, pills. "Hate," I am using the word "hate" about pills. My compliment is that when you came to my house that time and told me how you'd never -- well, you were there, you know... The next morning I started taking these pills.
Then I've really overshot here 'cause I was aiming at just enough to keep you from walking out.
What do you mean? You said you liked it.
I'll take a bus.
You don't have to answer everything I say. Just listen to me. Okay?
Go ahead.
Were you asleep?
What a break...
I'm gonna grab you.  I didn't mean it to be a question. I'm gonna grab you.
Stop staring. Do a vase.
Thanks. But I just want to take a bath and...
What are you trying to do to me?
Jackie, will you hand me the mirror?
Your neighbor -- Udall -- is taking care of him.
Yes. Your dog is fine, Simon.
So am I, Frank.
What I know is that as long as you keep your work zipped up around me, I don't give a fuck what or where you shove your show. Are we being neighbors for now?
You may think you can intimidate the whole world with your attitude, but I grew up in Hell. My grandmother had more attitude. You don't intimidate me.
Shhhh now. I like Simon. I like him enough to batter you unrecognizable if you verbally abuse him or so much as touch his dog again. Meanwhile, I'll try and think how you can make this up to him.  I hate doing this. I'm an art dealer.  Have a nice day. Party!
About a dog.
Yeah. If his parents are alive they've got to help -- those are the rules. Good.
Like the wind but I'm not doing it.
I'll be able to keep my apartment and studio, won't I?...  Just tell me.
Ask him.
I got it. You're talking about your dog. I thought that was the name of the colored man I've been seeing in the hall.
Like thick molasses, with one of those wide noses perfect for smelling trouble and prison food...
It smells like shit in here?
Come on, sweetheart...
Got any easier questions?
Never a break. Never.
I'm coming.
I'm a great guy -- "extraordinary"...  ... and she doesn't want contact with me.  I'm dying here.
The fact that you haven't said, "hold it" means I haven't done it right...  is that correct? I haven't done it right?
Just a second -- he has to go.
So you're from around here?
Didn't you here all them sirens? It's been all over the radio.  Some guy shot Leevio Valli, and a bunch of bystanders, in the Trattoria Roma.
It's just a shoot-out then.  Sixty- forty, at best.  Not my odds.
We both know what you were doing.
Tachlinkov.
What?
Why don't you tell me.
Freelancer.  A woman.  Surveillance specialist.
Robert?  Robert?
What?  How did you know I had a cat?
Yeah?
What do you mean, 'that's all'? What in the hell do you know?
Right.
Because he took a contract on you. He'll come for you and he'll find you.
No.  It's the truth.  I know what you are.  Like me, like Bain, you're a ghost, you're not part of the real world.  You don't have a social security number.  You don't pay taxes.  You've probably used ten different names over the last ten years.  A long time ago something probably happened, something illegal and you ran, you disappeared and it was easy.  You think you can do it again.  But I'm telling you, fading from the law is nothing.  No matter what you do, where you go, I swear to you that Bain will find you.
As in daughter of Agamemnon?
Where you wanted to be?
How did you get into the business?
Why did you leave the Agency?
Tell me about the first time.
Does that mean it didn't bother you?
Where is it?
Nothing.
Oh.  What do you think about?
No.
I don't know... maybe I'll live on a boat, sail to all the places I've never been.
Here?
I don't know... But I'm sure he's not sleeping.
Taiwan.
Check.
Why won't he wait until the bank closes?
What?  What if he brings it with him?
Except --
Except, if he doesn't come out of the hotel.
You can't know for sure, how can you?  I mean, you're not him.
Yes.
No.  I went back to the hotel.  And waited.
I hate bishops.  They're useless.  I like knights.
Jesus, if someone had --
Why in the hell would you take that chance?
Why?
I'm playing white, remember.  You can't tell me which pieces to move. It doesn't work that way.
Are you attracted to me?
Why?
I'm not sure that I care anymore.
Oh, God.  I see it!
God damnit, Electra.  This is not a game.  This is business.
Jesus!  Why didn't you tell me?
How can a beautiful man like you be shy?
Holidays are our busiest days.  No one likes to be alone on holidays. I know I don't.
I think you're supposed to answer that question.
Just a little ways.  Up to those trees.
Why not?
I hope not.
It's a common question.
Taken.
Go ahead.
Anything.
You mean quit?
Naz dravi!.....What do you like about this place, these people, Chris?
I don't know, I don't care. I see too much of him and he's changed. He used to be busy at the magazine. But now he's been doing nothing for months, like he doesn't care about anything, including me.
Yeah, but it's not just that. To the Czech mind, any movement, whether political or literary should be underground. If it isn't, then it's not radical and not worthy of a look-in.
You're outnumbered Kat two to one, got to go with the majority, that's democracy.
What's that? Free!
Give'em a break Doug, all it takes is a little work.
You've got to stop using that word "we" it's getting kind of scary. Right Katka?
No thanks, I think we ought to get going though.
Great. Let's say nine o'clock here tomorrow. Catch you later partner.
He was an electrician?
So?
A locksmith too? Why d'you ever bother with writing?
No, just making my contribution to cultural enlightenment, that's all.
Nope, not even close. I've thought of a name for this place and you were the inspiration though.
Can you do the lock on it?
See if she can donate some paintings or something to hang on these walls, give it a bit of atmosphere.
I had a better idea, we'll burn them. There's a drum across the road; I was just waiting for the workers to go home.
Both, see you later.
No, not yet.
What?
Holly!
What are you on about?
Good, what's his number?
42 56 76......... Okay, you wait at Dave's for my call tomorrow, if you don't hear from me by three o'clock, send that note and get out of the country fast.
Some deal you did there!
No!
No, by road?
Yes.
Yes.
That's my mum's.
They didn't look like medical files to me.
Sure. Excellent.
Hmm, I see possibilities but you got a lot to do.
Shhhhh, I'm concentrating!
Ooh, well excuse me.
What? You are crazy!
Okay, whatever. Come on Chris!
Alright, I'm coming. It's the perfect place Jahn, thanks.
I'm sorry but it's been a crazy evening. I'm going to make that place into something big. God, I love you!
Fernet and tonic.
No, it's not true, you're lying.
Sure, I've done it easily.
Don't go making it too simple, we're on the cutting edge here.
Yeah, great....Dobchay! It will dry, yes?
Of course, you can see that lady over there, she is recording everything.
Well she sure isn't normal.
The way I look at it, I've carried the camel to water and stuffed it's head under - if it doesn't drink now, we might as well shoot the thing and call it a day.
Guests.
Sometimes.
Cool!
I didn't get to see what's on the disks but I can guess. Do you want to hear my terms or not.
I have the Director's word, there will be no action against them. You may go once we have the disks.
Yeah!
Good, wait here, it will not take long and then you may go.
Working....Under cover.
A drill, what are you up to?
Oh that's it? Everything I do is crap!
Well come on, sit down.
You bastard!
Yes, if you can get him free.
This press we cannot control. Americans, I think.
In a building belonging to the University in the Old Town.
Some Americans?
Because she doesn't know what a hint is.
He wants to show now.
No. I won't be long.
Be yourself and I don't think there is a wrong thing.  Let Jamie take the lead. She'll let you know what she needs.
It was.
Like me.
28 is do something illegal. 42 is befriend an enemy.
Are you asking to mock me or do you really want to know?
Spend a year in the Peace Corps. Make a medical discovery --
Don't bother!
That is my telescope.
Maybe debris from a moon that broke apart.
Looking for something -- someone.
The dirty snowball at its core.
I know there's a plan for everyone, but sometimes I don't understand what the message is -- or what the point is.
I'm really glad you think so.
You don't miss a thing.
Yeah --
Thank you. So were you.
You're hardly nice to anyone.
It's not.
You don't know the first thing about being someone's friend --
Yeah, with a finish in about a decade.
When I have something to say.
We're going somewhere. After. And no. I didn't ask your father.
We're doing something -- ?
What are you talking about?
Fun.
You're straddling the state line. You're in two places at once.
Yes, one of many.
No.
I'm sick.
I should have told you sooner --
No. The drugs just stopped working. If anything, doing things I love kept me healthy longer.
All the time.  I feel like I have no one.
I'm not going back to school.
Lead man.
Let's get something straight. You don't know me. I don't know you. But I know what you're about.  Keep your distance from this house -- and from Jamie.
That won't be possible.
Either. Both.
I'm not tired.
In there.
I'm using an old phonographic turntable.
Please.
For pay?
I'm as underprivileged as they are --
Thank you.
Scalene?
Yes, sir!
I beg your pardon?
Poly-what?
Have we ever met before?
Uh, hi....
How could I forget?  Oh, sure, I remember you.
Oh, I'm feeling much better now.
Oh, no, I'm fine...fine.
You do?
Coming, Eileen...
How are you?
Nothing. Look, I'll write it down for you, okay?
But I've never picked a fight in my entire life!
I'm going to be at the dance.
Why?
Marty. Marty Lewis.
What year?
Home, school, here... 
That reminds me, if we could scrape up enough for a 35 film chain, I've got a connection with a projectionist in a first run house -- we could be sellin' new movies on the street before they're even in the theater.
Now hold on a minute, Professor! Hold the phone. Are you trying to tell me that this -- all of this here -- that this is -- it's a -- a --
Professor, can this thing send Shemp back in time?
What if you lost your keys?
You're talking crazy! An atomic blast would melt me and the time machine in a matter of seconds!
Are you trying to tell me that my mother's got the hots for me?
Professor Brown grinned. I guess I'll see you in... about 30 years.
1982! March 18, just like we planned! My calculations were absolutely correct! Thirty years! God, I cannot believe it's been thirty years! Sure, it was a long time ago -- longest I've ever had to wait for the results of an experiment!
Sure,.
Dick Wilson? Dickie Wilson? Dickie Wilson runs this place? That's a laugh!
Well, he's gone.
Yeah, he said for you to give us a lift into town. You're the ones with the Studebaker, aren't you?
What's going on?
Okay.
Yeah.
What do you mean?
Running this place for a fella in town. Nothing much to speak of.
Long as my ammo held out... Right there's where you caught me.
Nope.
Tom...
I know you do. Good luck to you, too.
What'd you come out here for?
Well, I got it all planned... and I'm taking Holly off with me.
Yeah? Why not?
You love him?
What for?
Well, I don't mind getting up early, so I got a job throwing garbage... I'm not in love with the stuff, okay.
What?
Now what's he know about garbage, huh?
Well, stop the world.
Great.
I know.
What?
But it would hurt.
Just looking.
I don't want a steak.
Excuse me.
Yeah.
No.
Yes.
Name is Carruthers. Believe I shoot people every now and then. Not that I deserve a medal.
New Jersey?
You mean the guy from the old wine commercials?
Then that's it!
They're stealing my chopper!
The creatures?  They attacked you?  They tried to possess you?
I'm a giant semi-conductor, and there's alien creatures all around us. Form the Eighth Dimension, I think.  Look...
It's your hand, Buckaroo.
Got a half a tuna sandwich.
I think I'm on to something. You and the guys go back to the house and dig up everything you can on an outfit called Yoyodyne.
I look great.  Let's rock 'n' roll.
What? How do you know that?
To get my guns.
Don't shoot!
John Parker, tell them we're doing our best.  Stall.
Who?
Any time.
Don't go to pieces.  I haven't got time tonight.
I gotta be honest with myself and not repress these feelings-I've got mixed emotions-I don't know if I can handle this.  Oh, boy...
Perfect Tommy's just threatened by smart women.  Can you play that thing?
I didn't drop 'em.
Why me?
Whadda you need Buckaroo for?
Bet you say that to all the girls, Perfect Tommy.
She's just a damn road hugger, Allison.  Plus the man can drive.
He'll wander back when he's sober and apologize. He always does.
It's alright, Barton. You don't have to write actual scenes?
What are they like? What are they about?
You wrote his scripts for him?
That doesn't help anything, Bill.
Bill 
...Who?
Oh yeah? What kind of write?
A week, eight, nine days 
What else?
W.P. Mayhew? The writer?
I'm buildin' a levee. Gulp by gulp, brick by brick. Raisin' up a levee to keep that ragin' river of manure from lappin' at m'door.
But Lipnik said he wanted to look at the script, see something by the end of the week.
Who?
You don't understand. He's in pain, because he can't write-
To do what?
To see pap.
Okay Barton, you're the artist, I'm just the ten percenter. You decide what you want and I'll make it happen. I'm only asking that your decision be informed by a little realism  if I can use that word and Hollywood in the same breath.
Yeah, I'm fine, Garland  I have to talk to you. I'm calling long distance.
Well, that's a good question. Strange as it may seem, Charlie, I guess I write about people like you. The average working stiff. The common man.
I can see you feel pretty strongly about it.
I can feel my butt getting sore already.
Yeah, I guess that's tragedy right there.
Hell no! Jesus, I'm the kind of guy, I'll let you know if I'm bored. I find it all pretty damned interesting. I'm the kind schmoe who's generally interested in the other guy's point of view.
See you, Charlie.
Charlie. How are you.
No... I guess it's something about my work. I get so worked up over it, I don't know; I don't really have a lot of attention left over, so it would be a little unfair...
Mine have passed on. It's just the three of us now...
Beery! You got no beef there! He's good.  Hell of an actor  though, for my money, you can't beat Jack Oakie. A stitch, Oakie. Funny stuff, funny stuff. But don't get me wrong  Beery, a wrestling picture, that could be a pip. Wrestled some myself back in school. I guess you know the basic moves.
Well, my pleasure. I could use a little lift myself.
Where there's life there's hope.
Well, I guess you pick your poison.
Don't pick up and leave without saying goodbye.
I've gotta call the police  or you could call for me 
Dammit, don't argue with me. You asked me to believe you  well I do. Now don't argue with me.
Don't worry about that, compadre. I'll be back.
Thanks, but I wanted a place that was less...
Boy! You writers! Work hard, play hard!  That's what I hear, anyway...
Ah, forget it, kid. I want you to pull this out of your head. If that sonofabitch wouldn't apologize to you, goddammit, I will. I respect your artistry and your methods, and if you can't fill us in yet, well hell, we should be kissing your feet for your fine efforts.
I had to call Beery this morning, let him know we were pushing the picture back.  After all I'd told him about quality, about that Barton Fink feeling. How disappointed we were. Wally was heartbroken. The man was devastated. He was  well, I didn't actually call him, Lou did. But that's a fair description, isn't it Lou?
You didn't let ME down. Or even Lou. We don't live or die by what you scribble, Fink. You let Ben Geisler down. He liked you. Trusted you. And that's why he's gone. Fired.  That guy had a heart as big as the outdoors, and you fucked him. He tried to convince me to fire you too, but that would be too easy. No, you're under contract and you're gonna stay that way.  Anything you write will be the property of Capitol Pictures. And Capitol Pictures will not produce anything you write. Not until you grow up a little. You ain't no writer, Fink  you're a goddamn write-off.
I don't know... I mean, I'll be here, uh, indefinitely.
Nine days  Tuesday 
What do you do, Fink?
Couple of days ago we see the same M.O. out in Los Feliz.
Physician, heal thyself.
I dunno, Duke. I kinda liked it.
You two have some sick sex thing?
Do you have any evidence that he showed your psychiatric file to anyone?
Home. Watching TV.
She was there, wasn't she?
It's bullshit.  You know it is.
No!  I'm working my tail off.  I'm off the sauce, I'm not even smoking anymore.
Thank you.
I thought you quit.
She knows stuff about me that only you know.
I told them you wouldn't want an attorney present.
I've got a degree in psych.  It goes with the turf.  Games are fun.
You see?  We're both innocent, Nick.
No.  Come in.
I don't know.  But you do.
Yes, you did.  They never tested you, did they?  But Internal Affairs knew.
I have attorneys.  They have friends.  I have friends.  Money buys you a lot of attorneys and friends.
Please.
What did Bobby Vasquez used to call you?
There's Pepsi in the fridge.
I told her it was the fuck of the century.
Do you want personal insights and adolescent secrets?  I don't do those.
I told you I had a vivid imagination.
Did you like her to watch?
When?
I don't know.
No.
What are you researching?
We fuck like minks.  We forget the rugrats.  We live happily ever after.
No.
Listen, lady, we can do this downtown if you --
Why would I need an attorney?
What was the weapon?
The usual -- a girlfriend.
I hope I helped you out.
It's my first drink in three months. That okay with you, pop?  She doesn't know me.  I never saw her before Gus and I talked to her.
I don't son, but I got the minority opinion.
Why the hell not?
You think I'd let you drive my Cadillac car?  I ain't lettin' no hear-up-his-ass person drive my Cadillac car.
Go stick your head in a tub of ice water.  See where she leads.
Is he dead?
She said she didn't know herself, just sort of did it on impulse.  The razor just happened to be there.
Formerly engaged to Roberto Vasquez, deceased --
On what basis?
You wouldn't be here otherwise, would you?
Did you check all four years?
Can there be some mistake?
He was shot.
Not sure. How was yours?
What about the shit they write?
Ignorant art?
Yeah, I met her already.
That's good. At least they're interested.
Wow... Stop giving them away.  I got an invitation to model for Comme de Garcons... You wanna do it with me?
Gee. You shouldn't take it so seriously, Jean. That's why you can't stop taking drugs. You always think people don't like you. Everyone likes you.
When I was poor, everybody doubted I could make it. When I got rich, everyone said, `yeah, but he'll never keep it up.' Now everyone says `he's killing himself.' So I clean up, and then they say `Look. His art's dead.' I don't take drugs, anyway. I'm healthy now.
Aren't they?
Sure.
Sure, ok..
I'm here.
Yes, but as a black painter 
What?
Still not here.
Thanks.  Your dad called again  something about a job.
About what?
Who's John Henry?
For real?
I guess it was a long time ago.
Party girls? Can I call you?
I do.  I just said that. I was never here before. I actually like it.
Oh, God, Basquiat, you scared the shit out of me. How the fuck could you do that to yourself?
Basquiat, what did you take?
You want some?
Well thanks!
I hadn't thought about it.
A present I picked up for you.
Fame. My liquid hijack Marlboros and the moon and the cow that jumped over it.
Fuck...  I forgot about that.
What time is it?
That's impossible. I've got, like, five of 'em!
I need this?
No, actually I feel worse.
I'm tempted, but ... well ... it is an occasion for celebration, and ... umm ... Selina will probably be there ...
Right.  Sure.  And "Peace on earth, good will toward men."
"Shreck's."  You --
We do.
I tried to grab you -- save you --
Better than you know, Bat-boy.
Well, I could ... free up some time...
Scare me?  No, actually, I was just scaring myself ...
No darker than yours, Bruce.
Had one.  Didn't work.
Nope, I told her everything.
Ah ... then you've come to the right lonely mansion.
Y'mean take off our costumes?
Weird, huh?
Yes, did -- did you injure yourself on that ski slope?  Is that why you cut short your vacation and came back?
Batman.  The thorn in both our sides, the fly in our ointment.
You're quick.  Mayor Cobblepot.
You're off the hook, Ozzie.  But Batman is decidedly <u>not</u>.
Dad!  Save yourself!
PMS.
Women... nothing surprises me, Chip. Excepting your late mother... Who even knew Selina had a brain to damage?  Bottom line:  she tries to blackmail us, we drop her out a higher window.  Meanwhile I got badder fish to fry.  Yeah -- Oswald, please.
My god ... it's true.  The Penguin- Man of the sewers ... Please, don't h--
We need signatures.  To overturn the ballot.  I can supply those, Oswald.
I'm the one you want!  Penguin, please!  Ask yourself:  Isn't it Max Shreck who manipulated and betrayed you?  Isn't it Max, not Chip, whom you want to see immersed up to his eyeballs in raw sewage?
And who ... would you say this <u>to</u>?
Too good?
I damn well better be.  In fact I want you to phone those goniffs over at Gotham Insurance and tell them --
Oh no, those things frighten me.
I have been part of the greatest adventure ever know.  I have found purpose here, and the family I could never have.
Despite all your talents, you are still a novice in the ways of family. Dick follows the same ends as you but gets there by his own course.  You must learn to trust him.  For that is the nature of family.
No apology necessary.  That's the first time in thirty years.
Specify, please.
Pheromones?
Rather disappointed at how poorly I taught you proper housekeeping.  And quite well, it seems.  Thanks to you, son.  Thanks to you all.
I'm so sorry to trouble you, but-
Whatever you say, lady.  It's all in a day's work for me.
Crimefighter's rule number one: never say that.
Damn?  Damn is not good.
Freeze, you're mad.  This capsule will slaughter thousands.
We have eleven minutes to stop Freeze And thaw the city.
I didn't kill your wife.
Surf's up.
I know.  The feeling just vanished.
Can he save her?
She knows who we are.
People come first, Dr. Isley.
Anybody want to tell us kids in the cheap seats who Joanna Clark is?
I'm late for the dedication.  Then I go after Freeze and Ivy.  Alone.
Yes!  Yes, I want her so badly I can taste it.  That's the whole point. Look at us.  Orphans.  Isolated. Obsessed to the exclusion of life, love, family.  We're perfect targets. She's done something to us, got us fighting over her somehow.
You once said to me that being part of a team means trusting your partner.  That sometimes counting on someone else is the only way to win.  DO you remember?
I wonder if I can get a cell with a view of the gardens?
You are looking unseasonably hot. Let's go inside and grab your rocks.
You leave Batman and Robin to me.
Kill them.  Of course.  But why stop there?  Why should only Batman and Robin die while the society that created them goes unpunished?
Just what I had in mind.  Everything dead on Earth except us.  A chance for mother nature to start again.  Plants and flowers are the oldest species on the planet yet they are defenseless against man.  Sorry hon, this is for science.  Behold the dawn of a new age.
Adam and Evil.
I'm hungry.  I think I'll have poultry.
I find that unlikely.
I've got to stop him.
What do you mean?
She has an excellent mind.
I wonder if she'd go out with me.
Your parents' wake. Rain fell like tears.
Ninety-three, including the sauna.
What did you say?
He ran away?
What?
No demons, son.  Your monsters are here. Until you fact that, I fear you will spend your life fleeing them.
Claw Island. Nygma's headquarters. I'm sure that's where they're keeping Chase.  Are all the Batsuits destroyed?
Big house. How many rooms?
How come this is the only locked door around this museum? What's back there?
What's wrong?
Try a fireman. Less to take off.
My life's an open book. You read?
You like strong women. I've done my homework. Or do I need skin-tight vinyl and a whip?
No more tricks, Edward. Release Chase and Dick. This is between you and me.
Oh please. You're blind as a bat.
Nostrovia.
On occasion. Usually at night.
So what you're saying, this guy's a total wacko, right?
So, this Riddler, he's dangerous?
Excuse me.
What? This isn't normal?
The glib, cavalier routine, it really is an act, isn't it?
Well, I met someone...
You could say he kind of dropped out of the sky and bang-. I think he felt it too.
And now....
I'd say this goes a little beyond taking your work home.
I'm not-
Rage. Anger. Passion. Pain.
Keep me off the couch, Doc. Your fees are a little rich for me.
Okay, tiger, take it slow. You going to give me your pin or something?
And when you finally get Two-Face?
Bruce, you can't.
Who is it?
Please. I swear I won't say noth-
Addictive isn't it? Just Say No. Until I say yes. A little fringe benefit of working with me. Now here's the concept, counselor. Crime. My I.Q., your AK-47. You help me gather production capital so I can produce enough of these  to create an empire that will eclipse Bruce Wayne's forever. And, in return I will help you solve the greatest riddle of all. Who is Batman?
Haven't you had enough? Don't Think And Drive.
Alexander Knox. Gotham Globe.
Thank you, Alfred.  I hope you'll excuse me.  It was a great pleasure meeting you.  And you.
Respectfully, sir... there'll never be another one like you.
What are you talking about?
... Murderer...
Too many people. Come on!  SHIELDS!!
Well -- I think you might consider
I just wanted to distract them. I wasn't trying to get a picture of you.
That can't be right. That would mean every shipment of every product is poisoned. We'd all be dead.
You're just back from Corto Maltese.  I saw your combat photos.  Quite a departure for you.
What is it you want?
I can't do that. Not while the Joker's still at large.
Too much work.  I'm not really the physical type -- Thank you, Alfred.
Well, Bruce, some types are a little more obvious than others.
I see.  If I know how you really feel, I won't like you as much.
Then there's one thing in the world you don't do very well. And I know what it is -- Now you'll have to kill me.
... I know it's you, Bruce. I'm not going to talk to you unless we can discuss it...
Do you still think the Joker cares about money??
It's a detour. They're backed up for blocks!
Sorry.  We had another bat sighting.
Why, Eckhardt.  You should be thinking about the future.
Gimme a break, will you?  Shut up.
Nobody wants a war, Carmine.  If we can't do business, we shake hands and part friends.
That's it.
I'd like to read a prepared statement. 'While this administration remains vehemently opposed to terrorism in any form, we are prepared to negotiate any reasonable demands which will guarantee the safety of the populace.'
Well, I'm starving.  Will you at least buy me a hamburger?
That, and the sweet smell of two hundred million bucks.
Allie... he wants to tell me. I had a roll of film. His face was on it. He knew that -- And he let me keep.
Yeah. Deja vu.
You okay?
Yes, there are hotels.  They just thought maybe it'd be nice for him to stay with a real American family.  Popcorn, waffles, all that stuff.
I said I'd check with you.
I need some time, David.  A little time.  It's not just you.  It's partly me.
0h Ali we can work this thing out, you know.
It's okay.  There's no one out here. Just open the door.  Trust me.
Now what does that mean?  My daughter wakes up with a strange man in her bed, and I'm supposed to think it's amusing?  That tie's God-awful.  Why do you wear it?
Great.  You said you'd ask Grierson about putting our guest somewhere else.  Did you?
Uh ... yes ...
Excuse me.
Ahm.... .
Well, Ahm....
Ah. Fine.  It's good.  It's great.
Isn't it?
Not necessarily.  That's where this ...  comes in.  No, I've had a better idea than sacking people.  You'll hear soon enough.
I beg your pardon?
No. Perfect.  Looking forward to it. CUT TO:
Time taken its toll on the old girl, eh?
Yes, sir.  Yes, sir.  Congratulations. Marvellous thing.  Bravo.
Ahm....
I'm fired?  Because I let a... copy of a painting the get stolen?
VERY ACCOMMODATING Well, no, sir, I'm sure ...
And a car.
A car sounds sensible.
What makes you say that?
Richard Burton was very good-looking.
Sean Connery.
Okay, so the guy's gonna look like Meatloaf's backside.  No-one's asking you to go to bed with him.
Ah ... Jennifer, I need you to watch Kevin.  Jen?
Jennifer!  This is not - repeat, not! how we do things in this family. I've told you never to get on one of those death traps!  Please - talk to me.  I promise to be reasonable.
Nope.
It's a kind of an interesting swap. Mom for the Man from Ga Ga.
The TV.
Entert-ain...us...an-us...Oh yeah! Heh heh. Anus. Heh heh.
Dammit! I need a TV now! We're missing everything!
Uh... Buuuuut. Boot. Someone named boot.
And Boot-Head.
Yeah, we should party.
Heh heh. This is the best night of our lives.
Me first?
Me first! Me first!
Yeah, heh heh, enough'a this crap.
That sucks. Heh heh. They need some shows about fire! Change the channel.
Yeah, it's just the same thing over and over again.
Uh... I think you scared them off.
What's your problem Beavis?
Dill-wad...
Uh... dill, um, face...
Oh, that's nice.
You'll have to speak up son. I have this ringing in my ears. My doctor says it could be related to my heart palpitations. I've had two operations on my heart.
Well, if you find yourself getting tired, take a couple of these.
OK boys. Get ready to fire on the count of three.  I'm gonna give you three seconds...
...o-o-o-eieee-ooooeeeooooo...
Well, sir it's not good.  Roll the tape... The X-5 unit is a new top-secret biological weapon, a manmade virus...
Where did these guys come from?
D.C., Chief.
Not now Bork.
That's right. I'm offering you ten grand plus expenses to do my wife. We gotta deal?
Uh, huh huh. Is that gonna be enough time?
Uh, huh huh, this fat dude. He said we could do you. And he was gonna pay us.
Uh, ten uh...
No, Jane.
We're rich in what really matters.
So do I, Jane.  I'm on vacation.
I will <u>never</u> sell this house. I'll be buried in my yard next to Barbara.  Holding hands!  And a good paintbrush!
Oh, Adam, the model looks so good. The Historical Society will love it.  You've finished the streets?
Don't forget the balls, Ernie.
Slow down there, honey... I don't want the vibration to weaken the model.
I am sitting.
Oh, Adam.  We're home.  In our own house.  Nonsense.  I'll make some coffee.  You get some more firewood.
They make gypsies look good.
Not really...  what's this?
We don't know who he is...  ... I'm going to talk to that little girl.
It's <u>not</u> stupid.  We're ghosts. Do you want this woman for breakfast for 125 years?  Moan louder!
Where are your skulls and bones?
This is different.  Eventually she'll take someone to the attic. And then what?  We've got to try to contact this guy Betelmyer. We gotta get some help, hon.
Of course I did.
Oh, Adam.  I don't have gloves.  My nails keep getting longer.  I'll break them.
I don't care, I've changed my mind.  ... I feel <u>really</u> confident.  We're getting better at this stuff.  We can scare them off ourselves -- tonight!  I've got an idea.  You're going to love it... I'm going to hate it.
Little black party dresses?
Just a hunch.
<u>Night of the Living Dead</u>?  It's this gross movie.
D-90's.  You spend a hundred and twenty-five years on earth, actually, in that house, during which you get only three class- one D-90 intercessions with Juno. You probably haven't even read through the manual completely yet.
For Juno, your caseworker.  Not that it matters to your type.  But there <u>are</u> all these other people here ahead of you.  I'd say three hours.
But... the Deetzes are <u>destroying</u> our house.
<u>Never trust the living</u>!  We <u>cannot</u> have a routine haunting like yours provide incontrovertible visual proof of existence beyond death.
Hey <u>you've</u> been on Saturn!  I <u>hate</u> those sandworms!  <u>Yecchhh</u>! I've lost a lot of buddies to sandworms.  So a daughter?  She got good legs? God I love a young leg.
Pity.  Murderers seem to have an easy time of it.  Just look at Amityville.  He was one of my boys.  Didn't have to give that one any lessons. From day one... But I must be off ... I've got a planeload of football players crashed in the midwest... they need a lot of help, just with the basics.
No!  Jane, it is 6:45 in the morning!
Jane, don't send photographs of our house around the country! We're not interested in selling.
They're dead.
Where'd they go?
I want to get in.
Yes.
No, dummy.  Two.
Good thing you are beautiful, kid. You are <u>dumb</u>!
Just <u>say</u> it.
You've <u>got</u> to say it!
How'd you like to have the biggest boobs in the world?  Right now.  I can do it if I get out.
That's fine, Otho.  Just keep me out of it.  I am here to relax and clip coupons.  And goddamnit, I mean to do it.
He's a cloven-hooved beast!
What's he going to do?  Viciously rearrange their environment?
Why not?
My whole life is a darkroom!  One ... big... dark... room.
Stepmother.
... sheets.
They're ghosts.  They do what they want.
Then we own a whole <u>town</u> full of nowhere.
Yeah yeah, we'll think on it. 'Bye ya, Charles.  You relax up there, ya hear?
I <u>told</u> them you were too mean to be afraid.
It wasn't a joke.
Look at the tiny figures.
That's a skeleton key.  It'll open any door in that house.  Will you give it to your father?  And you might mention that I single-handedly decorated the house.  In case he needs advice in that area.  Come see me.
The attic.
Yes. I think so, too.
Thomas Franklin, an attorney.
There's no need for a claim, the garden is a healthy one.
Thank you.
Hardly any, Robert.
No, Robert.
Yes, Ben told me to be in his room at ten o'clock.
Yes, Robert. I have seen it before. It happens to old people.
I don't think so, he should be along soon...
Fine. Thank you, Mr. Franklin.
Gentlemen, needless to say, there is going to be a full Congressional investigation of your respective operations.  Good night.
Please, hold still, Mr. Gardiner.
Oh? Certainly...
My name is Chance.
No, Eve. I'm not related to Basil and Perdita.
No. It won't do that.
Hello, Eve.
Yes. It's feeling much better now.
Yes.
Yes. I liked Louise very much. She was his maid.
No, Eve. I don't read the papers.
Yes. That could be true.
He was very ill, I stayed with him for a while.
Thank you.
Yes. I like to watch.
Hello, Sid.
Yes, that is correct. I think you should ask Mr. Rand that.
I have nothing more to say.
I see.
Yes. It's a very good show.
I don't want Robert.
Yes, I understand.
Yes, it is.  Would you tell me your name again, please?
Sure you do. This ward is air tight, I have a little extra oxygen pumped in, keeps my spirits up.
Yes. You look very sick.
I see. I would like to work in your garden.
But I don't have that any more...  ... All that's left for me now is the room upstairs.
Reluctant to speak, eh, Chauncey? Well, I can understand that. When a man loses everything, anger has a tendency to block out reason for a time. Just give it some thought, work with the idea, I'm sure you'll have plenty to say in a few days.
Good. Together, the two of you should create quite a stir - I can already hear the gossip.
I like to watch.
I can't read.
Yes. I like to watch.
Yes, I would like to see Ben.
No. I'm not badly injured. But my leg is very sore.
How long? I don't know, see what the doctor says ...
... Good evening, Louise.
Must of happened durin' the night, I don't know... Lord, he wasn't breathin' and as cold as a fish. I touched him, just to see, and you believe me, Chance - that's doin' more than I get paid to do... Then I just covered him up, pulled the sheet over his head...
Yes. I was there with Ben.
I am a very serious gardener.
No, I do not have any of those.
I would like to stay and work in my garden.
As long as the roots are not severed, all is well and all will be well in the garden.
That is correct. In a garden, growth has its season. There is spring and summer, but there is also fall and winter. And then spring and summer again...
... You will honor me and my family with a visit, won't you?
Try again.
Reasonable? Good, I'd like to meet a reasonable man. Why don't you ask this Gardiner to join us for dinner?
Hah!... Tell me the truth, Eve - if I wait until I feel better, will I ever meet the man?
Thank you, Wilson. That will be fine.
Chauncey, this is Mrs. Sophia Rowley.
Would you two excuse me for a moment?
No, that won't do any good.
Oh, no, sweetheart - it's not you...
It's not that, I just...
Of course... I'm so sorry for you, Eve...
I really don't know, Tom - he seems so honest and simple... In a way, he's quite charming...
Sally Hayes is not a bitch - she's a damn fine attorney! I've got to talk to her about this Gardiner...
We have nothing on him, Ambassador Skrapinov.
Apparently the White House shares our curiosity - they have also launched an investigation, and, according to our sources, neither the F.B.I. nor the C.I.A. has met with success.
Clearly, yes comrade.
Very good, Your Excellency.
Good. Anything else?
Thank you, Colonel.
... Mr. President, how good to see you.
It's that serious, huh?
This is my fiancee Maxine.
Okay.
I'm pretty sure it was you. Hey, could I get your autograph now? It's for .... oh, what the hell, it's for me! I'm your biggest fan!
Craig, listen, honey, I've been thinking... maybe you'd feel better if you got, you know, a job or something.
Well, you know, maybe something else until this whole puppet thing turns around.
The monkey.
Nah. I'm not hungry. I'm sorry I didn't call. It was just, you know, hard to get away.
Right.
Yeah. You want a beer?
Yeah. We'll do it right now. On the way to Lester's house.
Don't crowd me, Craig.
You should feed your animals. They're looking peaked.
What?
You've always loved the animals.
Well, you have the Maxine action figure to play with.
I feel that somehow my parents never prepared me to make this particular decision. Not that I blame them. How could they know? Today's world is so complicated.  No. I have to go away now. I'm sorry, Lotte. I'm so sorry.
What the hell, darling. Close early today, live dangerously.
That's true. Oh, God, Lotte, what have I become? My wife in a cage with a monkey. A gun in my hand. Betrayal in my heart.
I'm sorry. Oh God, I'm sorry. I'm some kind of monster. I'm the guy you read about in the paper and go, "he's some kind of monster."
I love you so much.
The iguana?
I'm sorry for everything.
And yourself too in the process. God, you're so beautiful. Why couldn't I see that before?
I'm through with puppets, Lotte. I just want you to know that.
Holy shit! He said what I said!
Simulates?
Let me try.
Schwartz.
Schwartz.
Forget it.
I am a trained performer.
Thank you for being kind enough to lie. You see, I've been very lonely in my isolated tower of indecipherable speech. You're hired. Any questions?
Dr. Lester, it's been really fascinating, but I'm afraid I have to get home to my wife now.
Yessir.
That's sounds fine, sir. Gotta run.
The vacant office. I see. Olive oil. Interesting. Be warned, Schwartz, there are certain doors which should never be opened.
Dr. Lester, I don't know what you're talking about.
You're insane.
Yes. Unfortunately it's bullshit. The real story of 7 1/2 is so evil that it could never be revealed to Americans raised on sitcoms and happy news anchors.
I'm right?
Just.
The usual, Barry.
Christ, you're not a fag are you? Because I don't want to be wasting my time.
Well, I'm a puppeteer...
It better be.
Is this Malkovich fellow appealing?
Are you torturing me on purpose?
I don't think so. I've fallen in love. This is what people who've fallen in love look like.
Yes, yes, sweetheart, yes!
Of course, right this way, Mr. Malkovich. Compliments of the house.
Wings and a halo, my darling. Wings and a halo.
Yes. Yes. A thousand times, yes!
Fork ah did?
Think, Jew florist?
I'm sure you're not going crazy.
Yeah yeah yeah. Yadda yadda yadda. Were you stoned?
All the better. Hey, Hot Lesbian Witches, next Geraldo, buddy boy. Ha ha ha.
The truth is for suckers, Johnny-Boy.
Do we get to wear a crown?
You followed your heart, my child, and that is not necessarily a bad thing.
No, I didn't know that.
Yes, Hi.
Broadway's finest three hours. It's about the suppression of the individual. Conformity as God in modern society.
Whatever you're having.
Oh, Lotte...
No! Please!  Shut up, will you? We're trying to think here.  It is sort of like being a puppeteer. I like that about it.
Busy day, my little fire chief. Why don't you climb into bed, and I'll meet you there in just...
I've got to leave Malkovich.
Whatever.
But you said...you said out there, there ain't no...what was that word?..no..de- fense. No de-fense.
I'm saying they came into my yard.
Not like He punished me.
I don't know. Maybe we should have moved.
..."Here. Look here. See this mark? If you can't tell me by my face, look here."
NO. THEY TRIED ONCE BUT I STOPPED THEM. THEY WON'T EVER COME BACK...YOU MY BEST THING.
Don't talk like that. Your mama loves you.
That's not true. I told you, I had to get you out, make you safe...so's you and me could be together on the other side, forever..
No. Since mama lost her job, we don't have no more pies..
Yes?
Haven't seen her since that day. Ella thinks she might be waiting in the woods for another chance but..I don't think so. Mama thinks she's gone for good. Says she can feel it.
Oh.
In case of what?
Well, what can you do?
Stamp, don't tear me up this morning! I don't feel like it.
Her who?
I told him...Showed him the newspaper. About Sethe. Read it to him. He left that very day.
I don't believe that. I won't.
Who is she? Where she come from?
All he can. All he can.
Don't you die on me!! This is Baby Suggs quilt. Is that what you planning!?
Wasn't this guy supposed to be a millionaire?
What do you think?
And we know which Lebowski you are, Lebowski.
Yeah sure, if I'm ever in the neighborhood, need to use the john.
Huh.
Why me, man?
Visiting friends of hers in Palm Springs.  Just picked up and left, never bothered to tell us.
Yeah, it sucks.
Come and get it.
ANTI-SEMITE!
That is for the urn.
Yeah Dude, why is Walter so pissed off?
Walter, how--
So you have no frame of reference, Donny.  You're like a child who wanders in in the middle of a movie and wants to know--
Shut the fuck up, Donny.
What the fuck is he talking about?
Where's your car, Dude?
Oh for Christ--will you shut the fuck up, Donny.
No--
You gotta buck up, man, you can't go into the tournament with this negative attitude--
Shut the fuck up, Donny.  This kid is in the ninth grade, Dude, and his father is--are you ready for this?-- Arthur Digby Sellers.
They won't hurt us, Donny.  These men are cowards.
Fuckin' A, man.  I got a rash. Fuckin' A, man.  I gotta tell ya Tony.
That's it!  Outta this fucking cab!
I'm not really, uh.
I guess he's pretty, uh, racially pretty cool--
Jeez.  Think he's got room for one more?
Well, yeah I did, but I spent most of my time occupying various, um, administration buildings--
And the, uh, the briefcase?
Well I like your style too, man. Got a whole cowboy thing goin'.
Ahh, you know.  Strikes and gutters, ups and downs.
Yeah, well, right man, there are many facets to this, uh, you know, many interested parties.  If I can find your money, man-- what's in it for the Dude?
In a sense, yes.  Elfranco, my robe. My art has been commended as being strongly vaginal.  Which bothers some men.  The word itself makes some men uncomfortable.  Vagina.
He fixes the cable?
I, uh... money, yeah, I gotta respecfully, 69 you know, tender my resignation on that matter, 'cause it looks like your mother really was kidnapped after all.
The main guy, Dieter--
Beaver?  You mean vagina?--I mean, you know him?
Huh?  Autobahn.  A-u-t-o.  Their music is a sort of--ugh--techno-pop.
Look, Jeffrey, you don't really kidnap someone that you're acquainted with.  You can't get away with it if the hostage knows who you are.
Well yes, what did you think this was all about?  Fun and games?
Exactly.  What happened to your face? Did Jackie Treehorn do that as well?
There's no fucking reason--here's my point, Dude--there's no fucking reason--
Am I wrong!
Fucking dog has papers, Dude.--Over the line!
This is a league game.  This determines who enters the next round- robin, am I wrong?
Well, just take 't easy, man.
The ringer!  The ringer, Dude!  Have they called yet?
My point, Dude, is why should we settle for twenty grand when we can keep the entire million.  Am I wrong?
It is a fucking game.  You said so yourself, Dude--she kidnapped herself--
What the fuck is going on there?
Well call them up and explain it to 'em, Walter!  Your plan is so fucking simple, I'm sure they'd fucking understand it!  That's the beauty of it Walter!
Fuck that!  I love you, Walter, but sooner or later you're gonna have to face the fact that you're a goddamn moron.
Your wheel!  At fifteen em-pee-aitch I roll out!  I double back, grab one of 'em and beat it out of him!  The uzi!
What the fuck is that supposed to mean?  What the fuck're we gonna tell Lebowski?
That's right, Dude, 1  % certain--
Yeah yeah, "kill that poor woman."
Who's got a fucking million fucking dollars parked in the trunk of our car out here?
And what do they got, Dude?  My dirty undies.  My fucking whites--Say, where is  the car?
But Walter--
Not if I have anything to say about it.
Huh?
Dude?
Well it's, sometimes the cathartic, uh.
What the fuck are you talking about? I converted when I married Cynthia! Come on, Dude!
Yeah?  What do you think happens when you get divorced?  You turn in your library card?  Get a new driver's license?  Stop being Jewish?
AND I'D LIKE MY UNDIES BACK!
No Dude.
Then what's...
Wha.
It's uh, it's down there somewhere. Lemme take another look.
Shit!
Yeah?
Okay, vee proceed.  But only if there is no funny stuff.
I understand sir.  Could you slide your shorts down please?
Well we--I don't--
No.  No Mr. Lebowski, that had not occurred to me.
Well. . . yeah.
You're bullies!  Cowards, both of you!
Stay away from me!  You bullies! You and these women!  You won't leave a man his fucking balls!
This is not Nam.  This is bowling. There are rules.
Am I wrong!?
A world of pain.
This is a league game, Smokey!
He's half yours, partner.
You're missing the point.  Their vampire victims don't die.  They turn.  They become carriers.  If the Reapers continue unchecked, there could be thousands of them before the month is over.  Do the math.
What the hell are you doing, Blade?
We need it.  Sensations are addictive and pain cuts the deepest.  Tattoos, piercings, tribal scarring -- because we regenerate, none of it's permanent.  So we have to take it to the next level. To remind us we're alive.
Nothing.
Right.  So why is he dying?  He doesn't appear to have any broken bones, no entry wounds of any kind -- what's killing him?
If that's true, what about Nomak?  He's been alive longer than the others.
I am a hunter.  A weapon.  It's what I do.  It's in my blood.
I want to see the sun rise.
Did you think I wouldn't?
Where the hell have you been?
Why don't you ask your girlfriend?
Look, I care about the humans who are dying, not you, got it?
So?
Thought you were dead.
Human?
He wants us to know he's hunting us now.
Two things.  One, I was on to you the moment they turned you.  And two --  I switched that dud of yours back with the real one.
They've made contact with the Reapers.
Two so far.
No.  This is a dangerous game, you're playing, Damaskinos.
No --  Does that mean I can't be a donor?
Look, what's your problem?
You little shit.  When did they get to you?
Wait.
Take him.
How do I stop it?
Figured they'd send someone after you. Thought I'd wait around and see who showed up.
It worked, didn't it?
There is no cure.
Look closer.
Owned by vampires. There's one of these in every major city, and just like Domino's, they always deliver.  You telling me you're ready to walk through that door?
Those aren't real memories. No one has that kind of recall.
Your mother sounds like a Hallmark greeting card.
Then what is it?
What about the chemistry panel?
This is purely professional curiosity, Karen, I swear.
Just the blood sample from the pericardial sac.
What?
Study him. Unlock the secrets of his DNA. He's the key we've been looking for.
Please. You and the other Elders wouldn't know what to do with these texts if your lives depended on it.  Which, of course, they do.
A few thousand scattered about the globe. In the past, we've had to restrict our numbers for fear of discovery. That won't be necessary after tonight.
You.
You're wasting your breath, woman. He can't hear you now. It's the Thirst, you see? It already has him in its grip.
Some of the old wives' tales are true -- they're severely allergic to silver, various types of wood. Feed them garlic and they'll go into anaphylactic shock --
So that's it? You guys just patch me up and send me on my way?
Go on, I'll be fine!
Join the club.
A coward too. That's why she had to go.
My eye, is there something in my eye?
I'm not a witch, you're all crazy!
--my God, Nick???
Look, this is not my field of expertise. You seem stabilized, but why take any chances? Let's keep you overnight and have the Staff obstetrician do a follow-up tomorrow.
--Christ almighty--
No idea, just talked to her on the 'Net--she's very good.
So whoever built this--
Not the only things missing, Nick.
It's like traveling back in time.
You sure?
Okay, fine, whatever, yes--it's an <u>old</u> tree.
Oh, <u>c'mon</u>--even you have to admit this is weird.
You know, Nick, you've been something of a total asshole the past few days.
Get your goddamn--
--you should get back into bed.
--what're you saying?? I didn't have anything to do with--
--fuck your bullshit pieties! You were the next to die, asshole!
<u>Before</u> 5:00--
You have to go.
I can't let you in.
--no, I think they're all in there.
--hunch. Just sort've saw 'em there.
No.
Well, please keep me fucking informed!
Turn the tapes back on.
Back it up, rewind, whatever you call it.
If I could do that, I'd be at the goddamn racetrack, not here.
It's not about witches, goddamnit!
--coming out of the water--
I spend a lot of time on e-Bay. Buying, selling--sometimes buying then re-selling at substantial mark-up, sometimes just selling crap I find in the street.
--Graduate Thesis--
I am.
It's a <u>serious</u> sociological study.
No problem, just give us 'til dawn and we're gone.
Look, guys, we're cold, we're tired we're <u>shook</u>--we just want to get out of here as soon as there's light. We saw something up at Coffin Rock today--
Asleep--
Spite.
I dunno it's safe to even get out of the car.
I can't!
Maybe whatever they are, they just haven't appeared yet on her?
Ancient runes--
Rusty Parr had the right idea on child care.
At least you still have the tapes.
--no.
Then I have no idea.
There is something <u>there</u>--don't ask, just trust me.
Sure. I'm sorry.
That they'll start touching us inside our heads.
Whatever.
Shoot.
Hey, chemicals, fear, sleep- deprivation--and a round-the-clock obsession with the occult--hell've a recipe for a mind-fuck.
Don't! You're making me lose my grip.
Anna--
I thought all witches were benign and good.
Does she, goddamnit??
--the marks appear, then you disappear. Like the little Kurth boy, like Domini, as soon as they come to full bloom--and mine <u>are</u>!
I'm talking to Taos, New Mexico--
What happened to my Dad??
Yeah? What happened?
...I don't know if you can fire a psychiatrist, exactly.
I don't know. I better get off now.
Yeah.
I cleaned it all up, but that ain't important...
What the hell happened, Ray?
Isn't that what you want?
What do you want to know?
With your gun?...
About ten years.
Going out with Meurice.
We don't seem to be communicating--
Uh-huh.
I don't know... I just think maybe I'm making a mistake...
Back where?
I mean, I ain't a marriage counselor--
Well... if you're not gonna fire me I might as well quit.
You owe me for two weeks.
I want that money. If you wanna tell me something, fine--
How long did you watch her?
Yeah, don't come by here any more. If I need you again I know which rock to turn over.
It's not strictly legal.
Listen, I'm not--this isn't a joke here.
What do you think?
For the money.
Go down to Corpus for a few days. Get yourself noticed. I'll give you a call when it's done... You just find a way to cover that money.
Ya catch any fish?
Nah, I trust ya.
Has Ray come in yet?
You said the usual--
Right. Sorry.
Jack Daniels. Don't worry, I'm paying for it.
What's the point?
Meurice. Sorry I didn't show last night.
You shouldn't have taken the money...
Tuesday.
Aunt Barbara. I'll try not to get depressed.
I'm not sick.
Okay honey. that sounds nice. Jeffrey. I think you've got termites in the house.
I've seen a few.
EXCUSE US por favor! Hey. let Tits see her kid.
Right Ben. LET'S GO FUCK. I'll fuck anything that moves.
Yes.
Does Dorothy know her husband is dead?
. my bourbon.
Then, shut up!
Those are my breasts.
Oh he forced you, huh?
I wanted to see you.
I sprayed your apartment. I took your key. I really didn't mean to do anything but see you.
Well.
I . I don't know.
See my nipples?
Yes, I like you.
Do you know?
I looked for you in my closet tonight.  It's crazy, I don't know where you came from but. I like you.
Frank? .can you stand up?
Who's it, you mean.
Don?. Are you in with them?
Sure I do.
What do you want?
Do you love me?
Men are crazy. then they put their craziness into me. then it makes me crazy. then they aren't so crazy for awhile. then they put their craziness in me again.  . it's burning me. but I love you. I do, I do. Did you know that? Did you know that I love you?
Okay. soon? Do you think I'm too fat?
I'm getting a little bit fat. I hate that.
No thanks. what does that mean?
Go where?
Yes.
Yeah. What are you doing now?
That's too bad.
There were at least three, maybe four. But a name that keeps coming up is this woman who lives in an apartment building very close to your house and also close to the field where you found the ear. There's also a business man over by the Franklin factory district that was questioned. and a musician. and some others.
Yeah, I guess so.  What are you going to do now that you're home?
Still, it must be kinda rough.
Yeah. Good bye.
Just a minute. pull over and wait a minute.
I'm here, aren't I?
Settle down. I have a plan which I think will work. There is very little for you to do, but I do need your help. .Aren't you curious about my plan?
Alright. the first thing is to get into her apartment and open a window that I could crawl into later.
You will be a Jehovah's Witness. I have a few "Awake" magazines for you. You don't have to keep her very long. a few seconds is all I'll need. Whatiya think?
Alright.
Yeah. let's get outta here. What happened?
Okay. You better get out before someone sees us.
That sounds good.
I'll drink to that.
I'm going in, Sandy. I'll see you tomorrow and tell you how it went.
Oh, okay. can I call?
Yeah.
Okay, okay. Bye.
It's okay. Don't worry about it.
I don't see how I can. and I can't prove any of this. I got all this information illegally. also it could get you in trouble.
That doesn't bother you, does it?
Why are there people like Frank. Why is there so much trouble in this world.?
Yeah I guess so.  You're a neat girl.
You better not, Jeffrey.
Jeffrey!!
I can't believe what you are finding out. Are you going to continue with this. Are you going back to her apartment?
Okay. great!
Really. you want to dance with someone else?
Frank!!
uh uh.
This is it.
It would be too much for him. So please let him think as he does, that you're home just to see him.
Really, he'll be home soon, would you like a cup of coffee?
Oh, you're welcome. Nice to finally meet you, Jeffrey.
Sure. just a sec.  Excuse me.
What?
That's impossible.  We can't be up and running.  Who's distributing?
No.  I have the space.  I figured it out.  This is what I want to do.
Thanks.  I am.  Where's Martha?
I feel like shit.  Me and my frigging nosebleeds.
Would you be bummed out if I didn't go to Chicago with you?
What?  You're not going to wait for me?
What details?  I put the coke in the false bottoms and take it through customs.
No.
It's your grass.
Here's the best part.  We can charge five-hundred a pound.
Nice doing business with you, George.
I heard.
For calling you a homo.
No fucking way.
Nothing.  Just a little project.
Never mind.  Not for you to worry.
Only two ways I know to leave here early.  One is to escape.
Slow down, George.  Slow down.
What is it, George?  Because I have to get home.  I've got a parole officer waiting for me.
But to the victor belong the spoils.
Try the back bedroom.
I love you too, man.
What?
Coke.
Yes, Barbara.  She was very pretty.
Okay, Mom.  It's okay.  Where's Dad?
I've seen those in magazines.  They're not cheap.
That's right.  Layaway.  Something you wouldn't know anything about, you cheapskate.
Yes, it is.
Yes.  I do not know, either.  What do you want, George?
Keep them coming?  Ah, yes.  Ha ha.  You are right.  But money.
I didn't come here to drink scotch.
Alright.  You want me to get your old job back?  Because I could, you know, I could put in that word.
I'm going to California.
Not mad.
I just don't know what you're thinking. I don't understand your choices.  You know, the police are looking for you.
I heard.  Ermine, your son is here.
What do you guys want?
Figured what out?
Holy shit, Dulli.  What the hell are you doing here?
Hello.
Why are you smiling?
I know who you are, El Americano. Mister George.
She did that before.
Don't give me that shit.  You just better do something.
Well, I got a call from Pablo.  He said this thing with Diego is a disaster. He's giving up lab locations, names, bank accounts, he was very pissed off. Pablo said to take him down.  His exact words were "Fuck Diego."
George, he wasn't asking.
What's happening to us?
Are we gonna split up?
Kristina, c'mon, I'm sorry.  I'm going to make this right.  I've got a few things going on...
Just to walk with you.  I want to be your dad again.
But I've got school.
Yes, I do.
Actually, I've got some news.  That fifty thousand I promised you, I couldn't get it.
This calls for a joint.  You want to do the honors?
G-d, I'm stoned.  I'm stoned.  I'm really...
Shit, yeah.  Do you know how much money I could make if I had this stuff back east?
What?
Don't be such a pussy.
The successes obtained are the results of those methods. One presupposes the other and vice versa.
Second district, Casbah, West Algiers.
Don't move, Hacene.
The NLF has condemned you to death.
They're not paying me anything. They've already warned you twice; this is the last warning. Decide.
I don't even know your name yet ...
You weren't able to. But what's important is that you tried.
Not enough.
Why?
A name?
Yes, I believe there won't be any more talk of the NLF for some time.
Why, yes, of course ... But for the moment, let's be satisfied with Algiers! In the mountains our work is always easier.
So, what good is it to us if it's been erased?
What good does that do -- it's the old will?
Had to.  I also interviewed three women who were in past relationships with Marsh.  There's no evidence that he had anything but straight sex prior to meeting Miss Lawson.
That's the best part.  She gets it all -- everything.
But there's more?
Yes.
We know Marsh had a head cold.   We found cocaine mixed with water in a nasal spray container on the nightstand.  The coke would contract the nasal membrane the same as any decongestant, but for a much shorter time.  He'd keep using more and more -- never knowing what he was taking.
We found a high concentration of cocaine in his blood.
I don't think so.  The membrane in his nasal passage didn't show any sign of long time usage.
Sex.
Alright -- I'm going to allow his testimony.
The M.E.'s report stated that Marsh's nasal membranes showed no sign of prior cocaine use.  Without the nasal spray we would have still treated it as a poisoning.  We would have looked for motive and the trail would have still led back to her.
Your Honor, Mr. Roston lived with the defendant for many months.  I feel that his opinion is valid in substantiating the character of the Miss Lawson.
That's correct -- but Andrew never told me he had a heart condition.  He said he had a heart arrhythmia and it was nothing serious.
I assume his girlfriend.
No -- but I can get it for you.
No -- never.
I opened the bathroom door one day and saw Miss Lawson pouring Cocaine out of a vial.
Yes.
No.  She stopped by to pick up some papers.
Yes.
We were lovers.
Intense.
I had a bad heart.
She said she was going to fuck me like I've never been fucked before.
I couldn't help myself.  You get lost inside a women like her.  It was like a drug.  It was the best sex I ever had.
I woke up the next morning and she was gone.
I was angry.
That's all Dr. Paley.
Yes.  I've been seeing her for over a year.
Yes.
What changed?
No.
So, isn't it possible that he was confiding in you about the pain he was feeling about losing what might be his last chance for love?  That what he really was saying was that the uncertainty of her leaving was driving him crazy and if it didn't stop it was going to kill him.  That if she did leave his heart couldn't take it.
You don't like her because you were involved with Mr. Marsh before she came along.  Isn't that true?
You see that's what bothers me.  No other bottle of nasal spray was found in the house.  The police looked. There was only the one bottle.  But you say you didn't arrive until after Mr. Marsh was dead -- yet we know he was using the nasal spray prior to his death.  How do you think it got there?
Why'd you come here?
And your sexual tastes were something that you hid from Miss Lawson?
No pain, no gain?
Yes.
Because -- it's beyond intellect. It's emotion.  It's passion.  It has to be experienced -- it can't be imagined.
We started talking.  In fact, we talked until four in the morning.  We discovered we shared a lot of the same interests.  After that we were together all the time until he left. He used to call me every night after he came back.  Then after a few weeks he invited me to come visit him. I've never left.
It's okay.
No -- I wanted to be a professional hockey player.
I broke my ankle skating.  That ended that dream.
What would?
Paley could be a problem tomorrow.
Fuck him!  He tried to shatter mine.
I knew you were thinking that.  I could see it in your eyes today in the courtroom.  You're wrong, Frank. I need you to believe that.
You're a monster.
Frank -- It's Rebecca.  I need to see you right away.  I've got the tape.
Shoot him.
How's it supposed to work Rebecca? You and Paley celebrate your victory. You get me over here and provoke a fight so he has to rush in and save you -- but then he's given himself away as your accomplice -- now he has to kill me.  After that I figure she'll tell the Police that you broke in.  That you were crazed because we humiliated you in court?
I love you too, Dad.
Mr. Roston?
Are you able to back up this allegation -- or are you fishing?
I am relaxing.
Really?
I don't know yet.  I want to hear what she says at her statement tomorrow.
Because I go to trial in seven weeks. I've got a lot of preparing to do.
Where have you been?
Why did you lie to me?
Is this what you want -- huh?  Is it?
I nearly died when we split the bill.
Well, no one in my family did! Dad bought cemetery plots at Oak Ridge. One for him, one for mom.
We're not doing it! I'm not even sure it's Christian.
Why are there two deeds here?
Aw, Betty.
He's not coming.
Well, he just gets on about how if mama ever needed him, she could find him through the National Geographic magazine. He as a photographer. He promises not to write again. Then all it says is...  I love you... Robert.
'82.
Don't talk to me like that. She was my mother for Christsakes. And now I find out she was... She was a --!
"... It's all there in the three notebooks. Read them in order. If you don't want to, I suppose that's okay too. But in that case I want you to know something -- I never stopped loving your father. He was a very good man. It's just that my love for Robert was different. He brought out something in me no one had ever brought out before, or since. He made me feel like a woman in a way few women, maybe more, ever experience..."
They got heat in Michigan.
Heat is heat.
Well, I didn't know they was a secret club.
Oh, that'll be nice.
After the divorce.
Oh, yeah. Actually, I had an assignment in Greece and I had to go through Bari to get the boat at Brindisi. But it looked so pretty I got off and stayed for a few days. Breathtaking country.
Long.  You just got off the train and stayed without knowing anyone there?
I don't mind waiting.
Want another cigarette?
Francesca.
Not at all.
I feel so embarrassed.
I don't know if obsessions have reasons. I think that's why they're obsessions.
Well, let's just call it a compliment and move on.  Did you love teaching?
You want to go back in?
Not at all. I wasn't around much... So why did I get married? Well, I thought it was a good idea at the time. Have a home base. Roots. You can get lost moving around so much.
I told you, I love other people.
No. But I love them just the same.
I'm a little sick of this American Family Ethic everyone seems to be hypnotized by in this country. I guess you think I'm just some poor displaced soul doomed to roam the earth without a self-cleaning oven and home movie.
Do you want to leave your husband?
I thought we were just having a conversation. You seem to be reading all this meaning into it. Meanings I must be too simple to, uh... interpret or something.
I uh... I had lunch in town today. Happened to cross paths with "that Redfield woman." I apologize. I thought you were half-joking about that.
The cashier at the general store was very dangerous.
Sure.
Are you hungry?
How about Italy?
You know that little place nearby with the striped awning that sells sandwiches and little pizzas...
Long day. Go to sleep.
What?
You have no idea what you've done to me, do you? And after you leave, I'm going to have to wonder for the rest of my life what happened here. If anything happened at all! And I'll have to wonder if you find yourself in some... housewife's kitchen in Romania if you'll sit there and tell her about your world of good friends and secretly include me in that group.
I don't want you to say anything. I don't need you to say anything.
For who?
The kids are grown! They don't need you anymore. You told me that. They hardly talk to you.
Yeah. It could get better.
I CAN'T SAY GOODBYE YET! We'll leave it for now. We're not saying goodbye. We're not making any decision. Maybe you'll change your mind. Maybe we'll accidentally run into each other and ... and you'll change your mind.
I'm very sad but Richard said that since it's Cary Grant, he completely understands. I'm also taking Mrs. Delaney away from this town. She'll be living with Cary and I in Beverly Hills.
Kinda pretty. Is this uh... jazz kinda singing?
Frannie.
I'm going to miss you.
Nah.
Isn't that nice? You should bring her home to meet us!
What happened?
Cremated?!
Apparently just before her death.
Then what do you care?
Alright.  Yes sir.  Anything you say.
Yeah.  He lived there.  And died there, too.
Maurice, man, shut the fuck up.
Saw Bones ol' Bones on top of the hill. Rolling fat jays outta hundred dollar bills.
I'm telling you, this neighborhood is coming back.
Let's get going.  Go home, pick up what we need, then crash here.
Spooked?
Whatever, let's just get the hellout of here.
Fine.  But I'm bringing a couple of friends.
Climb out to where?
What it will be.
It ain't the money - it's the high.  The big fat floating 'what if?'  And it's way more profitable.  Nobody ever wins.  So you never have to pay out.
Don't need luck tonight.  I'm just letting 'em have their say before I say no.
Where we'll always be...
We met.
How did you get in here?
No we won't, Momma.  I'll just have them call and tell Patrick it's us.
Anytime.  Be seeing you.
No.  It goes way back.  Or so my Momma says.
Or the living fall in.  Who knows.
Bill!  Bill?!
I can't carry it in my pocket, man.  And I can't go get it for you cause you might be a cop.  You gonna have to pick it up yourself.
That's the past.  It's dead.
Dad?
What building?
You cut him, or I shoot you.  Make your choice.
I ain't killed nobody.  Shall I rack 'em?  Play a game, Lupe?
We got a gift for you, Eddie.  Fresh new BMW.
No, Eddie.  It's just that, I dunno.  He was tall, and thin, and like a shadow, his face was just a blur.  All I remember is the voice.  It was smooth and low and it didn't seem to be comin' out of his mouth.
Look, you guys want to play college radio, high school reunions, and some fool's club once a week for the rest of your lives, that's cool.  But I think we can do better.
Evidence of what?
Ask Johnnie!  Ask your rat-fuck son!
You aim a gun at me?!  Do you know who I am?!  I am Gino Marzzone.  You understand?
No, Caesar, gimme the gun.
Why?  'Cause you know him?
It was unbelievable!  Un-fucking- believable!
What are you going to do with it?
Ummm ...  in the linen closet.
It was him.  I'm positive.
Caesar, I know Johnnie.  It was him. I screamed when I saw him.  I couldn't believe I missed them.  I knew you were going to be upset so I thought I'd apologize and give Gino the Scotch.  I honked a couple of times but he didn't stop.
Bullshit!  You don't need me!  You've never needed me!  I can't help you! Understand?!  I have to get out.
What?
Caesar, you just killed Gino Marzzone.
Caesar, someone could see us out here.
Let us go and we'll make a deal.
Ha!  What a load of crap.  Look at yourself, Caesar.  You're a thug. |You launder money for the mob.  You rent women like you rented this apartment.
Oh, right.
No.
Okay.  Let me call around.  I'll see what I can do.  Don't go anywhere, okay?
Yeah, that's it.
Where in the hell is he?
Ssh!  I can't hear Gino!
Gunfire?  Is this a joke?
Rajeev, the man who usually works on the building.
My pleasure ...  but to be honest, I did have a slightly ulterior motive here.  I was wondering if I could ask a small favor?
No, it isn't your fault.  The walls here are just so thin.
Yes, it really causes problems. Sometimes it's like you're in the same room.  But if it's too much trouble, I understand ...
That is so amazing.  I'm in awe of people who can fix things.  My dad was like that.  We never had anything new.  Whenever something broke he would open it up, tinker with it and it would work.  His hands were magic.
I knew it.
Not exactly.
What do you want?
No.
If I say yes, will you take your hand away?
...  yes.
Tell me about it.
I guess I wanted to.
So am I.
I know!  You can't understand, because we're different, Violet.  We're different.
Is that what her daddy tells her?
Mickey?
What choice?
Is that what you think?
He hung it up.
To let it dry.
Good.
It started way before I was around. I think basically it's because he thinks Johnnie is a complete idiot. But Johnnie runs Chicago because Gino is his father.
Not much, really.  Caesar was nervous, kept cleaning the apartment.  |The first time, he picked out the dress he wanted me to wear.
Because of what you are going to tell him.  You have to make it as real as you can.  The moment you open the door with the Scotch in your hand, you will be covered, and that moment is the most important moment in the plan.
Don't be sorry.  Help me.
Hey.
I think everything is okay.
Violet?
Sure you're going to be okay?  I mean, if you're having second thoughts, my offer still stands.
Then I'd have to explain Treadstone. And you'd have to explain how you let me get this far.  Doesn't sound like much of a Plan-B, does it?  We'll clean up the field.  You clean up your budgets.
I want a second opinion.
What if he <u>is</u> working for someone else?  What if he turned?
...it's a problem...
...or in a car...when it's dark...something with the headlights...  ...pills, right?  Treadstone had those pills...
...what did you do?...you must've really fucked up...
What did I do?  I spent thirty million dollars on you.  I spent three years finding you -- four years training you --  What did I do?  What in the name of God have you been doing, Jason?
So it's time to go home.
Yes.  I mean, I think so.  Yes.  Yes...
Yes, sir...  How can I help you?
One moment, please...  I'm afraid, I have no one by that name registered, sir.
...I understand...
Right.  Yes.  Of course.
Do you -- his brother -- do you have a phone number?
That'd be great.
<u>No</u>.  No, that was too easy -- 
Then I'll find another ride.
I know that.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I was shot twice in the back.
You got me pretty fucking curious.
Nah...  With you, I mean, you'd probably just forget about me, right?
All this stuff -- it's all about boats.  I think I'm in the shipping business.
-- we can't stay here -- I can't stay here -- it's not safe here --
Let's go --  We got to get away from this phone.
So get the hell out of here.
-- here we go -- I found it --
What?
-- I'm the one that got ripped off! -- not you -- not the United States government -- me -- I'm the one being ripped off!
I tried.
-- yes, sir, it's confirmed --
-- we're evacuating the building --
No.
I haven't got an emergency. Get out of here.
What have you done to my flat?
He's tampered with it, Dowser.
... yer ducts.
I'm waiting for my daddy.
- In fact, killing people - they'd get a lot more out of life.
I understand this concern on behalf of the tax-payers. People want value for money and a cost-effective service.
Beginner's luck.
Thank you, David ... and a very merry Christmas to you all.
Your father and I were very close. Of course Jeremiah was senior to me but we were close friends ... especially after the bombing  and I  keep his name alive at the office every day.
Really? - God, how time flies!
Er, I knew you looked different.
Thanks. Are you officer 412/L?
I've got numbers all over these - I'm not sure which is the one you want.
Am I?
Yes. I'm impressed.
Of course. We went to school together. You're my oldest friend.
But, I've already put her on the search and detain list.
We don't make mistakes.
Er ... alright. For Christ's sake don't lose it. Here, you'd better sign for it.
Sam ... we're proud to have you at Information Retrieval. Merry Xmas. 
Tell that to the wives of the Security men she blew up this afternoon. Listen, we've also had a report just in from Central Services that Tuttle has wrecked an entire flat and sabotaged adjacent Central Services systems - as a matter of fact, in your block. I'd keep my eyes open if I were you, Sam. Bye.
I do. Goodbye. 
Ah.
Who are you?
What?
What?
Who will?
Stop it ... damn you!
Let go! We've got to stop!
"Lady bird, lady bird, fly away home, your house is on fire and your children all gone" ... Do you think anyone's hurt?
Your face ... are you hurt?
Take care.
It's not the machine. There's a mismatch on the personnel code numbers... Ah there we go! That's a B58/732 when it should be a T47/215 ... Tuttle ... he should have 31.06, debited against his account for electrical procedures, not Buttle.
Call the motor pool and authorise personal transport.
Here we are. Pink and blue receipts. All you've got to do is sign these and the back of the cheque.
Yes.
What's the matter?
A woman eh? I see.
{suddenly unctious) Oh, but of course ...
A most perceptive choice, Madam, if I may say so.  Monsieur?
No you're not. Jack Lint is a lesson to you - he never had your brains but he's got the ambition. You haven't got the ambition but luckily you've got me. And Mr Helpmann. Mr Helpmann was very close -
I know, I know ...!
Numero trois, steak.  Monsieur, Mesdames, Bon appetit.
No you couldn't, sir. This is Information Retrieval.  the lift's arrived, sir.
Monsieur. Quel numero.
We'll be back.
But ... I called Central Services.
What?
The paperwork, couldn't stand the paperwork.  Over to the left please, if you don't mind sir. Hold it there. Yes, there's more bits of paper in Central Services than bits of pipe - read this, fill in that, hand in the other - listen, this old system of yours could be on fire and I couldn't even turn on the kitchen tap without filling in a 27B/6.... Bloody paperwork.
No. But I can bypass it with one of these
You know they won't do it. It's up to you. You gotta be strong.
She's having a baby. Twins.
Two years. Ever since we left island.
He flipped out.
Got a beer?
Did you give Mary something called Red Death?
Just take it easy.
You're going to live.
Ten-four, hon.
Male diff breather, approximately 30, Houston and A.
No way, man.
You came out of the hospital. You were tied down and hallucinating. You got some bad chemicals in your head, Noel. There's some medicine at the hospital that will fix that.
He's working a double shift.
I think it looks good.
I was just going to get some food. Pizza. Maybe we could.
Okay.
Look, I'm sorry, but it's important to me. I mean, a week ago I was wishing he was dead. And now I want hear his voice again, just once more-- you know what I mean?
I grew up on Elizabeth. I went to Blessed Sacrament.
We moved out after that. Upstate.
They're fine. My old man was a bus driver, mom a nurse--I was sort of born to it, I guess.
Ah, no. I was.  It's hard to explain. She had a hard time adjusting to, well, maybe it was my fault too.
How long you been doing this?
Wow, you musta seen some things, huh? What's the worst thing you ever seen?
Maybe not. I was a different person then. Does everybody you meet spill their problems on you like this?
I better go check on my father. Thanks for the pizza. I owe you one. Maybe when he gets better, you know, when we're done with all this.
I'm all right. I just can't stand to see people tied up.  I'm in the waiting room for hours, listening to Noel screaming. The only reason he's screaming is 'cause he's tied up.
No, no.
Because you can barely walk.
I need to sit down a minute.
It'll be a while before he's up and running again.
No, the city doesn't discriminate. It gets everybody.
She wasn't looking at you, man, she was looking at me.
I need a drink, that's all.
We just saved a little baby boy. Think of it that way.
I wanted to bring them in, to see if he'd respond to voices, but they weren't in the waiting room. The guy's daughter was in my face all last night and when I finally have something positive to tell her, she's gone.
Crazy fucker.
You have to keep the body going until the brain and heart recover enough to go on their own.
Look up, Frank. Full moon. The blood's gonna run tonight. I can feel it. Our mission: to save lives.
Well, he's the steakhead of the night, then.
As long as we keep moving. No standing still.
You want some bum in the bus terminal? We'll wait for a real call.
He's crazy. He can't help it.
Okay, whatta I do?
Frank!
You're crazy.
It's Mr. Oh. I'm not answering it.
It's not our job to taxi drunks around.
He's drunk.
No way!
Four times this week I've had him. Aren't there any other units out there?  Don't answer the radio. They'll give it to someone else.
You're almost there, you can do it -- can do -- can do.
You've made my dreams silly.
I'm not buying into any of that.  I have a load to learn.  I'm not going to act as if...
The pointers were great.  I'll study the tape.
Yeah -- well, I'm sorry I'm tying up Jane, I didn't realize you two would be going this late.  Sorry.
I thought she'd be here.  I'll go with you.
I'll see you back at the hotel.
Yes.
Ravenous homosexual.
Eleven and a half.
You spend too much time -- much too much worrying about that crap...  Oh good.
Which means I'm at their mercy and who wants that?...I'm not going to tell you where this thought led me... Anyway, well, why not  tell you? -- it's a happy thing.  In the middle of all this I start to think about something that does nothing but make me feel good and makes immediate sense and that's you ...And I'll stop here but, Jane, I'd give anything if you were two people so I could call up the one who's my friend and tell her about the one I'm in I...I don't think I should go any further.  Come on -- I'll walk you to the corner.
A long time.  I was restless. Will you crack my neck?
I didn't know you were going with him.
Okay, great -- good luck.
No.
I'm not kidding.
I don't know.  At a certain point it was so off the chart bad -- it got funny.  My central nervous system was telling me something. Jane -- sweat running down my face -- makeup falling into my eyes -- people turning this fusillade of blow dryers on me -- all so I could read introductions to other people who were covering stories which is what I like to do anyway.  And I'm chipper because you finally showed up.  I thought I'd cook for us. Tequila and eggs sound good?
No!!!!!
This is important to me.
Yes, yes.  I know.  Right.  And if it had gone well for me tonight, maybe I'd be keeping quiet about all this...I grant you everything but give me this...he does personify everything you've been fighting against...And I'm in love with you.  How do you like that? -- I buried the lead.
Really?
Well -- my wife got this new job...
I'll put him in the low corner of the frame -- good.
Wipe me out?
Please prepare carefully.  This couldn't come at a better time.
Move away from me.
What is she shooting?
Oh, come on -- tell us another.
No.  I think anyone who puckers their lips and presses it against his boss' buttocks and then smooches is an ass kisser.
You can make it a little less brutal by knocking a million dollars or so off your salary.
I'll speak to you soon
I liked it.  He's not afraid to be human.
And Bobbie says...
Yes.
We could...
He said something about...
Bad manners.
Yes, it's true.  They're going to make it public Wednesday but isn't it a big deal for you to have it a day and a half early?
My roommate's very social -- somebody from Justice was over and...I always hear things before they happen.  Hey, and from now on, so do you.
No.  Really...don't worry about it.
Oh.
I'll speak to you.
They fired me.
Honey?...
Nooo.  This way the rotation stays the same.
I don't know.
No.  But, honest.  What are you supposed to say when they keep talking about your looks?  I don't even know what they mean -- "Beat them off with a stick."
Would it help if I got you a tutor?
No, it's awful.  Oh my, it's awful.
Fill for a second.
Well, they say if you can reach even one person, it means something... And you did that.
Totally understood.  Totally wrong of me to talk shop after the day you've had.  Totally sorry.
No, I really got this job on a fluke and wait till you hear where it ends up.
How are you at back rubs?
I trust you.
You weren't.  Thanks.  How does it feel being here?
I just got back -- I don't know which end is up.
Excited.
George Weln is at the Pentagon where the attack launched by the lone Libyan pilot has resulted in a massive movement of military might.
Yeah?
Well, what is it?
Jane, yes.  Tom?  Tom, is that you? Is this Tom?
Good.  That's it...See you.
Well...
Where are you?
Okay, great, Grunick -- Easy shots now -- huh?  Good night.
Of course it's the reason.  It's terrible what you did.
Jesus, if you're glib about this I'm going to lose it.  I was up all night and...
It's amazing.  You commit this incredible breach of ethics and you act as if I'm nitpicking.  Try and get this.  When you edited that...
Then you should stay here.
A picnic?
God Almighty -- Whew.  Do I mind? Why do I mind?  I do mind.  What a shock -- I don't have a right to... I don't think I like him.  I know I don't respect him...So what am I talking about -- what am I saying to you?
Right back to you.
The way you were looking at me, I just went.
I didn't finish talking to you!
Yes.  Fifty dollars an hour, right?
What, right now?
Shh!
Oh it's enough...
You're breaking my concentration!
Alright I got you, man.  It's my turn for freak patrol.
Righto.
It wasn't easy.
Now you're a professional!
Here here...
Thank you.
Hm...
Oh...f-for a long time.  Ever since you first came to the club.
No! I want to talk about it now!
What?
Don't you see Carla?  I made them immortal.
Do you have to be so cold to him?
Nothing...nothing at all.
I admit it.
Why not?
That's the idea, Walter.  It's the only way to gain recognition. All the big art critics and art dealers would be there, it would be an event.
Not only that, he copied us!
I know, man.
Man if this place doesn't cool out I'm gonna hang out somewhere else...
Right.  Ain't no body of work complete without some... nudes -
No man, he ain't the type.  He don't get enough vitamin E.
You want me to buy Dead Cat?  It'll scare people away.
I didn't mean to.
Sure!  So I guess that means I'm an artist after all.
Alright get a grip on yourself Now since you're here why don't you start early, the kitchen needs cleaning.
I don't have another cat!
What, Mr. De Santis?
I-I already got a new one!
I don't know, it just happened, I guess.  I didn't mean to.
Yeah and what would I say?
It was.
Put it down, Walter.
Can't you see I'm busy here?
Chasing the dragon?  Whaddya mean?  You sure you don't want a pancake?
You're like an undercover guy!
Telling you what?
I got you cold, pal.  Make it easy for yourself, use your head.
Yeah yeah yeah - look!  I've heard this song and dance before, save your breath, you're coming with me! Lou goes to turn Walter against the wall but Walter springs back -
Uh, I don't know.
What do you get?
Walter, you did something to me with your work tonight.
Hello Walter.  I want to tell you the super fixed the leaky pipes and sealed up that hole in your wall.
I'm always alone, Mrs. Swicker, you know that.
Well why don't you clean up this dump!
Stay away from my thang.  Sorry, honey.  'Thing.'
Andy, start breaking up some chairs. You'll need weapons.
Bummer metaphor.
Oh, yeah, and then you'll never call me.
Get away from here.
I mean it.
My bike!  She's a lesbian, too. She told me.
Guys.  The environment.  I'm telling you, it's totally key.  The earth is in terrible shape, we could al die, and besides, Sting's doing it.
Eeyuu.
Uum... around ten?
Maybe.
Hey, it works for me.  If they want to leave you alone in the house, all helpless and vulnerable...
It's the news, Buffy.
I just want to see the basketball scores.  It's important.
Nothing.  It was just a dream.
'Bye.
I think you've forgotten something.
I am so sure.
Yeah, I was bailing.  I have a friend, and he's really... well, he's really vampire, I guess.  Bad scene.
I think I'll just hang out here. Make sure the sun comes up and everything.
Yeah?
I think I could help.  You gonna tell me you don't need help?
I'm going shopping.  Don't try to stop me.
Get away from me!
Don't be such a fraidy-cat.
See, Cassandra likes it.  Cassandra's my friend.
Bogutude.  Blow it off.
Like my homework.
'Just remember you're in training, son'
Get out of my facial.
I'm sorry.  That was impressive. The...  tumbling.
I'm looking for you, actually.
Not at all.  My name is Merrick.  I was sent to find you some time ago. I should have found you much sooner but there were...  complications. You should have been taught, prepared.
To bring you... your birthright.
To stop the killing.  To stop the vampires.
I have to show you.
Our purposes.
We'll cover it later.
We're going to have the work hard. You'll need some excuse for staying out.  For your parents.
Cheerleading.  For... sporting events, yes?
Last night.  You knew I was sitting on a fresh grave, didn't you?
Two days ago, would you have even hit me?  Let alone so powerfully?
No.  No bats, no flying.  They... float, occasionally.  Not really flying.
They were vampires?
Try to pay attention.
A what?
What do you want?  Encouragement?  'Gosh, Buffy, you're so special, I just want to give you a great big hug, oh I'm just having a warm fuzzy.'
But it's in the back.  Why are we wasting time with this, anyway?
I kind of had to improvise.  Sorry about your guitar.
Make time, okay?  You're the one who told me to act normal.  I've missed three practices already.  If I'm not there for the Barber game tomorrow everyone's gonna talk.
I'm pretty much learning not to accept anything anymore.  Come on, Merrick.  Football.  Afterwards we can kill and kill until there is nothing left.
And where are they now?
You got a C-plus?  I can't believe I cheated off you.
Cassandra's really smart.
Yeah, just make sure you do first. Let's go, guys.
You're having a fling with him?
What's happening?  What do you want?
Really?
You know you must.  There is only one.  Now you are that one.  It is time.
She has died.  You are the next to be called.  Why do you think you were sent to me?  Trained as you were?  You bear the mark.
Jeffrey!
I heard she got straight A's.
Snapped.  Buffy was, you know, on the upswing, and I swear to God she went across the room.  Perm over heels.
Wit-tay.
Pike isn't a name.  It's a fish.
He is so bald.
As long as there's room for three in it.  What, didn't you bring your new friends?
I'm leaving, man.  I'm bailing town. This place has gotten way too hairy.
I didn't say "Crash".  I said Nuke.
Honey, don't ever listen to a woman when she's making love. They'll say the strangest things.
Big League pitchers don't use these.
If I throw too hard I'll hurt the kid.
Oh don't be silly.  Death is nothing to be scared of.  It's just another way of living.  It's just a fresh start--kinda like spring training.
Y'know, Annie, I been thinking if it works for one game, maybe it'll work for a whole buncha games.
No, no, it was great.
Yes I do...
Of course I'm seducing you for Godsakes, and I'm doing a damn poor job of it--  Aren't I pretty?
So am I.  Nuke, honey, we need to talk--
--but you're father's in there!
I think I'm ready for the Show.
No, no--I'm fine.  Millie, how much time did you and Jimmy spend together before he proposed?
Annie Savoy.  Wanta dance?
I don't trust a man who don't dance.  It ain't natural.
Why do you get to choose?  Why don't I get to choose?
I'm not interested in a woman who's interested in that boy.
You're pulling your hips out.
Let me.
Crash, I get wet just thinking about you.
You okay?
I can do that, too.
Jose Galindo.  He hit .314 at Lynchburg last year.
Ninety-five miles an hour...
That's not necessary, Jackson---  Okay, Nuke, now lean in for the sign.
He'll learn.
We were worried that Ebby might get involved with the wrong crowd in professional baseball--we're so pleased, he met a Christian woman.
If you believe in Voodoo.
C'mon, God damn it, gimme some!
It was a cocksucking call!
No!  I said It was a cock-sucking call and you can't run me for that!
You spit on me!
Beg me!
You're a cocksucker!
But he ain't seen my heat--
A gift.  When you were a baby the gods reached down and turned your left arm into a thunderbolt.
Go for it.
If he had a good breaking ball, I'd respect the shit outta him.
Yep.  He really crushed that dinger, didn't he.  Musta gone 450 feet...damn...
It's time you started working on your interviews.
Jesus.
Shut up.  I'm playing.  Oh you won't regret it, young girls don't forget it, lost in their own wilderness ...  But it's all so easy--Just try a little tenderness...
Let go of me!
You fuck!
Why are you a fuck?  'Cause you got talent.  I got brains.  But you got talent! You're God damn left arm is worth a million dollars a year.  All my limbs put together are worth 7 cents a pound--and that's for science and dog meat.
Yeah, thanks for everything.
The Crash Davis. ) And you, Larry Hockett, should recognize me 'cause five years ago in the Texas League when you were pitching for El Paso and I was hitting cleanup for Shreveport, you hung a curve on an 0-2 pitch of a 3-2 game in bottom of the 8th and I tattooed it over the Goodyear Tire sign, beat you 4-3-- and I got a free wheel alignment from Goodyear.
What're you thinking about out here, Nuke?
Crash, shut the door.
Pussy.
I ain't hitting a man first.
We'll be praying for you.
Ain't he warning up?
You been around, you're smart, you're professional, you know what it takes--  We want you to mature the kid.
I heard he's wearing women's underwear--and he's breathing through his pingala nostril.
You were never my guest?!
I never comped you?! I don't comp you at least two or three times a month at the Tangiers?!
These guys back home don't give a fuck about the Supreme Court and any of this bullshit! They want things to quiet down. They want you to walk away from -
Watch it, partner, watch it!
Yeah.
Look, Gin, you know I got other people in this. I got partners. But I want you to understand that I am lookin' out for you in this thing.  Okay? You're going to get yours back... and you're gonna get it back first. Okay?
Right back.
So, once she signs those papers, she'll be the only person to have total access to the box?  No one else, including myself?
Well...
Help, Daddy!
Wait a sec, Nicky, Nicky, Nicky. Ta- take it easy.
Listen...
You find any cash in there, we'll whack it up with you.
Ginger.
Honey, come here.
Me? That's why the bosses sent me out here. They wanted me to make sure none of the other crews robbed the joint. Like these two fuckin' balloon-heads over here [EDDY and JERRY]. They were gonna try and bang us out of two hundred fuckin' grand?  Yeah, right, I'm sure.
It was typical Ace. He invited the biggest people in town and he knew they'd show. Because he knew they all wanted somethin' from him.  With Ace, nobody ever got a free ride. Even Ginger. With her -
...and he tells me to go fuck myself.
What? Ho-  Hey, come here.
I gotta do somethin'. I gotta do somethin'. They ain't gettin' rid of me. They're not gettin' rid of me. I'm staying here. Fuck 'em. Fuck 'em.
Well, it's okay. I'll use the service entrance. I'll see you at nine.
What're you doin'? He's a square guy, for chrissakes.  You can't treat him like that. He's gonna run to the FBI.
I don't wanna come along with you.
I don't wanna be involved in anything you're talkin' about...
Yeah, that's out of context. Okay.
Yeah.
Look at you. You're fuckin' walkin' around like John Barrymore.
...uh, uh, cigarette holder. I'm - I lost control?!
Yeah.
No, I didn't. What good would that do? That's not the fuckin' point.
The point is that she's upset. She's - and you got a fuckin' problem.
And I - what was I supposed to do, throw her out?
Your fuckin' head is getting' bigger than your casino. That's your problem, pal.
I see you, you motherfuckers.
Meet me at three.
What people?
I don't even know what you're talkin' about, Nick.
Yeah, I did want to go on TV. That way I have a forum. I can fight back. I'm known. People see me. They know they can't fuck around with me like they could if I was an unknown. That's right.
Me?! I wouldn't even be in this situation if it wasn't for you. You brought down so much fuckin' heat on me. I mean, every time I meet somebody here, the big question is do I know you.
Just give me the money. Fuckin' give me the fuckin' money, Sammy.
Well...
They were ready to blame him for anything, no matter where it happened.
Come on. There we go. Look at that. Beautiful.
...as soon as Andy got back home, Nicky heard about our talk in the car.
Why is she eight pounds over?
I...
'Mr Rothstein' is good enough.
...And this is Ronnie, who takes care of the card room...
Oh, no.
No, just - just give him, give him ten. That's it. Ten.  I'll be right down.
I hit a few... uh, games on the way back.
Hey, Mitch.
Good luck.
We're not getting any younger. Don't you think it's time? Aren't you gettin' tired of all this shit? Bangin' around, hustlin' around?
Yeah, I know all that.
No, I - I... mean...  that can grow as I - as long as there's a mutual respect... that kind of thing can grow. I'm realistic. I can accept that. But, you know, what is... What is love anyway?  It's a... it's a mutual respect. It's - it's a devotion. It's a... it's a caring from one person to another. And if we could set up some kind of foundation...  based on that mutual respect...  I feel that eventually you would care enough about me... that I could live with that.
It's nice isn't it?
You can trust me.
What? What?!
You know what, Ace? I don't give a shit! I'm gettin' out of here.  I am.
Oh, God. Oh, God. Okay.  Okay... I'll try. I'll try.
We had a deal. Remember that?  He said if it didn't work out between us, that I could get my things and I could leave.
Yeah, yeah, I got the rest.
With what?
He needed some clothes.
First of all, he's not gonna wear f- thousand-dollar suits. But let's say he did, which he won't. How you gonna get fitted for twenty-five suits in three days?  I, um, I mean, how could you get fitted that fast? I can't get fitted that fast, and I pay twice as much.
I'll go, but I want my money right now!
And don't send your guys down there to stop me! I mean it.
Look, I tried to do this thing. I know that you want me to, but it's just - You know, I'm driving down the freeway and the fuckin' thing's 'beep-beep-beep-beep'. You know, I'm in a restaurant and it's - it's embarrassing. I don't want to do it anymore.  Where's Amy?
And where'd you go?
You know why I want to do it. Just do it.
Mm.
I know you were with somebody. Who was it?  I just hope it's not someone who I think it might be.  I just hope it's not them.
What if he won't stop?
...you out of your mind? That's our child. Are you out of your fuckin' mind?
I should have -
Listen to me.
You listen carefully! You ever fuckin' touch her again, you ever do anything like that again, I'll fuckin' kill you.  Pure and simple. Do you hear me? Pure and fuckin' simple, I'll fuckin' kill you, you bitch.
You fuckin' whore!
You want your jewelry?
What are you running for, Bob? What are you running for?
The action is in the front, not in the back. Bring 'em up front.
Well, it's a casino. People gotta win sometimes.
God! 
What?
You shut up.
Well, I'm goin' all over, layin' money out of my own pocket, and I never get anything back. What the hell's goin' on?
Listen... Nicky... we talked about this... and, uh, I explained to you that there was the possibility you might have to take some kind of loss.
Sam?
I understand.
Jeff, would you go in with her?
You - You fuckin' moron, I'll be filling out paper work for the next two months because of you and this piece of shit, you...
Bullshit, I ain't goin' anywhere with you!
Here we go!
I did - I didn't -
Nicky, I'm sorry.
Turned out to be one of the other coaches was a fuckin'...
We're waiting on Carmine.
Well, listen, uh... Good luck with the joint, huh? 
We can't help him if -
What?
I know.
Hm.
He's good. He's fine.
Ma che cazzo!
Mm.
Pleasure.  Very nice to meet you.
So, he put aside some jewelry for me. A lot of jewelry.
I'm told it's worth about a million dollars, maybe more. 
All right?
Yeah?
Well, I was thinkin', maybe... you know somebody at the bank...  could help me get my jewelry out?  There's a lot of money in there. Lot of money in there, and I'd be willing to take care of anybody who helped me out.
Mm-hm.
Yeah. 'Cause, you know,  He's never gonna give me my jewelry.
Yes, I will. It's what you want, isn't it? Huh?
Me? I said... nothin'. I said, I said, 'No, no, no.' Everything he said, I just kept sayin' no.
Thank you. Very nice.
What's the matter?
You are.
I love you.
Yeah. This is the best thing I can do for my life right now.
Uh, talk to you later.  Bye. 
Lester - he called you here.
So, he knows where you are. That means he's sending some guys over here probably right now.
She started it. She started the whole thing. I'm just standin' here.
They check in alone?
Boy, look at this place, huh?
Why?
'Cause you're a jag-off. I would have fuckin' made you lay ten...
What's takin' so long over there?
What, are you gonna have a fuckin' meeting here, or are you gonna buy some diamonds?
I took care of everybody.
Hey. This is Shelly.
But, hey, what do they care, as long as I keep sendin' money back.
Let 'em complain. I'm the one who's here.
Walk, walk, walk. What'd you say?
Yeah, what's to stop him?
Fuck you!
Ch-Charlie M!
Kill me, you fuck, kill me.
How you doin'?
What thing? Oh, Nicky... I thought you was layin'.
No, I want to have this marked, Mr. -
I'm sorry.
You are right. What can I...
Then do it the way you want.
Ayy!  Some cat's blocking the periscope.  Somebody, give it a swat...
This looks promising...
In women?
Hey, hey, the client comes first. You think I want my future children to know their Daddy created Frank's Fun Palace?
I got home fine. How's the "warehouse."
They do take their time. So..Selina Kyle...
Boss, we better roll if we're going to hit this place, blow it up, and make that flight..
At this point, a nap. Oh by the way, I killed your butler and your dog..
You might be right, but Fun is overrated.  I need something real.
I hate innocent bystanders.  Whine, whine, whine. Will he settle?
He didn't remember to roll up his window...
"Well done," Cactus.
I don't know what I was saying. I totally phoned it in last night. I haven't been getting a lot of sleep lately...
Why am I still troubled...
How could I forget. Mammoth--go pet the kitty.
I know how you feel, humiliated in the hands of a woman. I'd rather eat my soul on a paper plate...
I got her...
Oh, I like her. I like her a lot. I want to save this one for later. Something that tasty you don't eat all at once. Go back to your alter- egos, we'll regroup in the morning.
Of course it matters!  It throws off everything!  "Superhero" is manhood's highest achievement. Manhood!  Your dirty little secret has diseased us to the core. You were my buddy, my comrade-- women aren't buddies, women aren't warriors!  You tried to turn the Cult of Good into some after-work softball team!  It's time to get thrown from the treehouse...
"A superhero's job is to protect.." Sorry, I can't take you seriously...I overheard you say that tomorrow the Cult of Good will be dead--I should be so lucky--what did that mean?
I still have one left...
You can't get away with..
Oh Frank, I'm not anti-male, I'm anti- you. Believe me, there's a difference.  Kelly is designing new uniforms for next week. Pay her and thank her. And is it a rule that the hottest places on the planet have the coldest air conditioning.  There's something out there called 73 degrees, look into it.
Most articles focus on the first half of her name--describing some feline monster.  I want the woman of Catwoman. After all, if it was a man dressed as a cat, the story would be on page 23--just another loony. Oh, I want this one. I want her bad..
I actually got some memory back last night.
I am. Dinner with Brock Leviathan...
About the same. Thanks for asking...Damn blender.  Okay, I can't stand it anymore, I'm dying to know--Did you try on some whiskers last night and hit a 7-11 along with all those other women? You had to have thought about it--a Catwoman for a night?
Okay. Let's get serious. Of course I know the Cult of Good is not good. Ever since I saw what they did in Atlanta, it has been my mission to expose them. I've followed them to Oasisburg and soon will have enough hard evidence to bring them to real justice. That computer disc could be the final piece to the puzzle. This isn't just a story, Selina--another damn Pulitzer--this is my life.
Oh, I forgot to tell you, you're on a diet...The fact you're still reasonably pretty is the one thing you got going for you.
What kind of name is "Brock Leviathan?"
We met on the Internet. The Captain put out a cryptic message calling for a new order of crimefighters. We don't even know each other's true identities...
I'm not sad, no, I owe the Captain my life. It's just you think you want to help prevent crime, but you realize that's too complicated. It's a lot more fun to punish crime. Then after a while, you don't care what's a crime and what's not, what you became a Warrior for. You just want the kicks. The rush.
Do I hear a woman's voice?
I'm sure he'll be heartbroken.
I'll explain later.  I'm sort of on hold.
You could've made me lose my call.
He's at it again.  Like that night at the Emerald.  This piece of Euro-trash is slapping shit out of his little wife in a back booth -- so Mr. Good Deed here has got to step in and pound the fucker's head into the wall.  Meantime "Wifey" recovers enough to pull off her high heel and nearly take our hero's eye out.  It took six stitches.
Look -- I've got the lives of maybe three innocent people hanging on the end of this line.
Then whose is it?
No reason to kill innocent bystanders.  Shit.  I can't hardly move my neck.
I got to get going.  An agent is showing me a house up on Broad Beach in ten minutes.
I'm going to level with you officer.
Yes sir.
I'm the one they'd be looking for.
I want the gun emptied.  I want to see all six slugs tossed up here. And then I want out.  That's all. <u>OUT</u>!
With all those holes Nels pumped in I knew you wouldn't suffocate.
Wait!  I hear her breathing now. There, she just picked it up again.
Shit.  There's the hotel.  You overshot the driveway.
<u>You're</u> doing all the talk.
It's rolled up in the tube on the floor back there.
What do you keep making me out to be?
Sure -- and they record your voice.  And later on we all get slammed for kidnap and murder. That's out!
What am I supposed to do?
I've been trying to get someone -- anyone.  For hours ...
Will you let me explain!
They're holding my husband downstairs.
I realize you don't want to be involved.
Because you know you'll be killing us.
They tortured my husband.  Made him give them the pin numbers of our accounts.  Once they get what's in the safe deposit box they'll kill us.
Shit!
They just walked out.  The smaller man -- he must be Dominican or Haitian -- he kicked me so hard. I felt a rib crack but I never made a sound.  It's starting to hurt now -- real bad.  A throbbing.  I can't even take a deep breath.
Let me call the school -- tell them not to let her go.
He's right?  Look, don't try to put blood on my hands.  You've got one hell of a nerve siding with him!
Even if I got there first she wouldn't go with me.
Just hang on.  I've got a life of my own.
What about the others?
I didn't mean to open up any old wounds.
Pictures.
I'm making my turn.  I see the school up ahead.
That's not her.
She's gone --
What do you mean?
Oh my God.  I heard her scream again.  What are they doing to her?  Why can't I do anything to stop them?
Because you're probably the last person I'll ever talk to.
Yes -- I think so.  Another crossed line?
Hi Lenore.  It's me.  I got you back.  Courtesy of Star 69.  Are you hurt?
Are you okay?
Your husband?
Shit.  I'm sorry.
Hand me the phone.
Why are you telling him that.  Are you crazy?
There isn't any such person.
Plus they'll remember you going after his daughter at school.
He seems to think he's entitled to it all.
I don't hear him moving around anymore.
You wouldn't --
Stop talking like that!
That's why we're turning off onto a fire road.
The money, Nels ... ?
I had it in my mind what you'd look like.  "Her," I could've painted.  <u>You</u>, I'd be afraid to turn my back to mix the colors.
As a child I hated being told how sweet I looked.  That angelic little face wasn't me at all.  I had to hurt people to prove to them they had the wrong image. Sometimes words were enough -- but I wasn't beyond inflicting physical pain in order to be taken seriously.  I enjoyed seeing the shock on their poor faces when they realized who I was.  That same look you gave me when I turned the gun on you.
He might've heard everything we said in the car.
We can't leave him to repeat anything.
You're the man with the gun.
Only one way to find out.
Turns out you did me a favor. You're looking at a rich man.
There are no guarantees in this life.
You'll see her.
I make my end of the cash at 184,000.  Now I'm trying to figure out the bonds.  What the face value is.
I'm not accepting criticism today. Now don't make me lose count. There's already a half million in this portfolio.
My pleasure --
Don't worry.
Better reassure him.
The fuck I will!
You want us to get ourselves killed?
Nels!  Guess who?  A friendly voice from beyond the grave.
I suppose you're in your taxi?
Intelligent question, Nels.  I believe she had plans for both our bodies to be found in close proximity.
Sweet revenge plus maybe a bit of vigorish off your end.
Following which we will have a serious question and answer session with your girlfriend.
Government business?
Undercover.
Who the fuck you kidding?  Send me money!
Yeah.
Then why doesn't she?
She's not a girl, Col --
Did he?
Stop it, Dil --
Cunt.
Charming.
Take your fucking goldfish, too!
She's not a tart.
What?
Consider it how you like. Just get that bloody tart out of here.
Not in my experience.
In a way.
Guy I work with.
No.
He's Scottish, Col.
Jimmy?
Must be.
He wants me to perform for him.
God no. I'm a hairdresser.
No, I didn't --
Where?
What look?
The things a girl has to put up with.
Whiskey.
Shouldn't I go?
He did sometimes.
Want to look after you.
Something I heard someone say once.
What is this?
No...
Give it over, Dil --
I said stop it.
When?
Why, honey --
You gonna tell me why?
You following me?
Kind of.
More than that.
Afraid so.
What?
Sorry. What you doing?
No! I'm going home...
You mean that?
I got the order to shoot him. Before I could do it he ran. Ran into a tank and died.
In a manner of speaking.
Don't you want to kill me?
He asked me to see were you all right.
Got to be somewhere.
More what?
Love you, Dil.
I'd do anything for you, Dil.
Don't call me that --
Stop it, Dil --
Fergus.
Please, Dil --
Absolutely. The younger the better. Doesn't come your way much, I suppose.
A girl has to have a bit of glamour.
He's all right.
Fucking do. I had him all over me.
No, what is the thing?
What do you mean?
Aye. Then we'll leave her be.
Was I?
Get that thing off me, Fergus --
The poor whore's suffocating in the heat.
I'm a volunteer, am n't I?
And who's Dave when he's at home?
Should blow you away, you know that?
Definitely unusual.
Just a girl.
How is it a farce?
My pleasure.
Nope. Not handsome at all.
So I've noticed.
You want to bet?
And you know the funny thing?
Absolutely not.
And you play cricket?.
How different?
My pleasure, Jody
Tree.
Well then, you're going to have to take my dick out for me, aren t you?
Means what it says. The scorpion does what is in his nature. Take off the hood, man.
I've often wondered how you do it.
Some kinds of women are...
Dil wasn't trouble. No trouble at all.
Want you to do something, Fergus.
I told you not to talk that way --
A story.
Tell me something, anything.
Why?
Hurling --
Tell me, Jody
People. They could be looking.
You shut your face --
You're crazy --
You greenhorn -- you half-witted, thick-skulled, hare-brained, greenhorn! They wuz both too smart for us!
I think that's what you ordered.
How was I leading you on?
What would you like me to say -- that a pretty girl with an outrageous manner means more to an old pro like me than a quarter of a million dollars?
I'm not hungry -- isn't it glorious?
You're going to look for him -- now?
Adam --
Why?
Well, I guess that's it -- dead end.
I know, but this is all we've got left.
Stop grousing. If we find the money I'll buy you an international conference all your own. Now start looking. You take this side and I'll poke around over there.
Look.
I'm through listening to you!
Here, give it to me.
Very sweet.
Danger? Why should I be in any danger?
Mr. Bartholomew -- if I had a quarter of a million dollars, believe me, I'd know it.
You mean it's just lying around someplace -- all that cash?
Because they're still here.
Yes, where?  -- in fifteen minutes. I'll be there.
Describe him.
By burying it, and then reporting that the Germans had captured it. All they had to do was come back after the war, dig it up and split it five ways -- a quarter of a million dollars with no questions asked.
Me? Why me?
I told them what you said -- about this man being Carson Dyle's brother. I asked them what they knew about it and they told me -- you're not gonna like this, Mrs. Lampert -- they told me Carson Dyle has no brother.
No, I do -- it was the stamps on that letter Charles had with him on the train. They were in plain sight all the time, but no one ever bothered looking at the envelope.
1944. The next face, please.
Does the name Tex Penthollow mean anything to you?
Crooked? I should think you'd be glad to find out I wasn't crooked.
We're not allowed to tell. May I have the stamps, please?
When did you see him -- what time, I mean?
The lunch hour. He probably worked it out in advance. He found an office that was usually left open and just moved in for the time you were here.
Before we start on that, do you mind handing over the stamps?
That's the idea.
What's wrong, Herman -- have you got something to hide?  Then I take it there are no objections.
I'll take that.
Yes, he is. He was my brother.
I met a man with sharp nails.
Haven't you got a bullet I can bite?
I'm no easier to live with than he was.
There must be some way.
Oh. Well, then he's a truthful Whitefoot, of course.
There, you said it.
Serious. When a man gets to be my age that's the last word he ever wants to hear. I don't want to be serious -- and I especially don't want you to be.
Cutting it out.
I think I love you, Alex --
Viens, Jean-Louis -- we're going to have a treasure hunt.
Maybe.
Why?
I'm sorry.
Shut the door!
I don't believe it.
How can I believe it when you don't even know who the killer is? I've got that right, haven't I? You don't know who did it.
I suppose all this is leading somewhere?
I was expecting you. You are American too, of course.
I'm -- I'm sorry -- I don't know anything about stamps.
That's right -- it's like ticklin' a alligator's belly.
You know I'd tell you if I had it.
I don't know anything.
I am Inspector Edouard Grandpierre of the Police Judiciaire. Would you be so kind as to come with me, please?
Leave?
I'm very confused.
We took the liberty of calling your dentist -- we thought, perhaps, we would learn something.
It stands to reason you are telling the truth -- for why would you invent such a ridiculous story?
Don't tell me you didn't know it was loaded.  Sylvie!
Oh.  Neither do I.  Voil!
I found it! I found it!
We won! We won!
I don't blame him. Jean-Louis -- do you know where this Monsieur Flix lives?
I'm afraid I already know a great many people. Until one of them dies I couldn't possibly meet anyone else.
Quitter.
The one you're blocking. This is the last chance I have -- I'm flying back to Paris this afternoon. What's your name?
Yes, I am -- I'm compulsive about it -- dishonesty infuriates me. Like when you go into a drugstore.
How do you know?
Well, the idea's right, anyway. Are you going to call me?
I'm a simultaneous translator -- like Sylvie, only she's English to French -- I'm French to English. That's what I did before I married Charles. The police probably think I killed him.
Something like that. But I'm sorry it ended like this -- tossed off a train like a sack of third-class mail.
Not too expensive -- I'm not a lady of leisure anymore.
The man and the woman are married --
Fun and games. Evidently we're the floorshow.
Having a nervous breakdown.
I -- I'm not sure if I'm supposed to tell you or not.
Yes, you were -- you called it nonsense. Being murdered in cold blood isn't nonsense. Wait until it happens to you sometime.
How do you shave in there?
Look, I know it's asking you to stretch your imagination, but can't you pretend for a moment that I'm a woman and that you're a --
What is it, Reggie -- what's he saying?
He -- he said if I didn't give the money, he'll kill me.
Words can hurt very much.
Wha -- what do you want?
a alors! From Charles?
I admit I moved to Paris because I was tired of American Provincial,
Don't you want me to stay?
Don't be silly -- he would not do anything. He is not yet old enough to be interested in girls. He says collecting stamps is much more satisfying to a man of his age.
The stamp market, of course -- it is here every Thursday afternoon. This is where Jean-Louis trades his --
What?
Don't be un-neighborly-like, Herman -- don't forget he done us a little ol' favor.
Then he gets it out of your share, not mine! Not mine!
I never fucked Rod.
You want me to die? I thought you and I were tight.
That's an awful lot for ten minutes of beasting?
I just wanted to check that you were okay?
That's impossible.
Dad ! Most of my friends can stay out until 11 on school nights and 1 on weekends!
Hi Daddy. Hi Mr. Sisler.
How well did you know Stacy and Rod?
I want you to head right home after school.
How much further?
I thought you'd be pleased.
There's a Lisa Shermer living just sixty miles west of here. Over the Indiana border. I'm going.
No. Let her get at least one more peacefully night's sleep.
This will relax her.
No. Hell, it's the quietest goddamn party I've ever seen.
What?
I knew you were a pervert. Always wearing those fucking doofy glasses, and driving a station wagon.
Of course I'm scared.
Because of your father. The way what his sins shaped you.
He's a rapist. Like mine.
I don't watch him eat everyday.
Want to come in for awhile? Log onto AOL, flirt with some married men, head into a private S&M chat room . . .
OK. increase the peace.
There will be a lot fewer by tomorrow night.
You watch. There's going to be a hymen holocaust tomorrow. Maybe I'll finally talk to Mark Shale.
FINE. Are you?
What party?
No.
I can't right now.
Everyone's getting ready for the party.
So? You're already late. A few more minutes won't matter.
Yeah. I think it's really sick.
So I should feel happy that he got away with it?
Sharon's far from a slut.
Deputy Webber's at the party. It's only three blocks away.
I love you.
Quick! In the house. He won't look for us in there.
Yeah. Who is she?
You didn't believe her?
And the police did nothing?
His mother's side.
Ok.
I know. I'm kidding you. Chill out.
Okay, okay.
...shit.
EXT. ROAD - DAY.
EXT. ICE CREAM TRUCK - DAY.
INT. ANDY'S ICE CREAM FACTORY/STAIRWELL - DAY.
INT. POSTAL VAN - DAY.
...that is going to explode...
INT. TUNNEL - DAY.
...-ty.
Uh, between this month and last month, you owe four hundred and seventeen dollars.  And we need that in cash.

Andy.  Another fuckin'...
...two things Andy is not.  Uh, but I tell you what.
That'll make up the difference, huh?
 No.
...-tana.
No.
What the hell is with you, dog?  He's the one with the damn gun.
I'm gonna bust a mudhole in your ass. I'm gonna--  Don't tell me to shut-- It's none of your business.  Man, I can talk all I want to.
What the hell's goin' on?
You'd better coast through...
Borrowed.
I didn't steal the truck! He owed it to me!  Anyway, the important thing is I'm not goin' through Missoula!
Okay, okay! 
You're nuts, goin' back there!


Oh...
All right.
Okay.
...gun?!
 No...
...you stole the truck to uphold your principles, right?
You  snatch that  phone  from me one more time, I'm--

...Pete!  Come on!  There it...
All right, you got it.
Eight and a half feet wide!  Weighs over five tons!
Goddamn!
Hey, hey!  Whoo!  Okay.
 Oh...
...Pete!  Come on.

 ...shit!
Okay.
Gimme that, gimme that, gimme that.
Then stay...

Hey, you didn't happen to lock the truck up when you got out...
You're fucked, man.
...-tion?
...stole the truck.
...or nephew or some good old boy...
Yeah, Robert Del Rio.
Anyway, about ten months ago, I wound up in Jerome, workin' for Darlene.
That is loud!  I'm 
Hey.   Mason.
Even though it is nice to see Andy...
Are you all right?
What?


  I've got the real thing!
...they come!
Whoo!
I'm gonna kill him.
 
We got-...
 There's gotta be...
Let's go!
Why'd you stay behind?!

They aren't exactly gonna publicize this,  Arlo. 

Excuse me.  I got a bullet in my leg.
But he didn't.  See, that's negotiation.
Arlo, nobody's gonna believe us.
Ooh.
Yeah.
 big balls.
That was quick.
To tell you the truth, we're looking for a scientist who's gone missing from the Tech Center.  Maybe you know him. Richard Long.
...within five minutes.
I don't ever wanna see another ice cream...
Oh, my God.
Well, well, well.
Three seconds.  One...

I ain't got time to argue with you today, Andy.  But I can tell you this.  Takin' your truck pissed you off?
He's the dude...
 ...Mason.  I can barely hear you.

The NSA thinks the UN is onto your work...
...sittin' here with our hands in the goddamn cookie jar!  And let me tell you something else.  I didn't join the service to let people like you turn...
Now, I know.  You have moral objections to what we're doing here, but believe...
...destroyer of worlds."
You'll kill us all!
It's too...
There's nothing to say, doctor.  Someone had to take the fall, and they still need you, whereas...I've never been anything more than a thorn in their collective side, as you once said.
...you were right, of course.  But after...
Went away? 
...happen if I drop this?
I checked your release date.  I never liked coincidences.
...-ians.  But I assure you, Leo...

It's a little late for matinee heroics, Mason.  Just give me the con-...


It won't be long, gentlemen.

You'd never understand!
Darlene, it's five-thirty.  Now, I worked late for you this mornin', and you didn't wanna spring for over-...
Oh, you're two of a kind, doc.  Oh, he may not have your sheepskins, and...
...he's smart enough to get you...
Secrets.
Go.
...now!
It must've happened right after we left.

One of our units is pursuing a suspect up the thirty-...
Been trying to figure out your secret.
...the master of his realm.
...is death.
Some people might.
 ...or it'll ignite. 
I got eight thousand yards. Radius is five...
What?
Okay, I'll have a chopper meet you at the top.
Got that?
...selling this young man beer Wednesday night.
...seriously.
I didn't sell the boy any...
You know, I gotta tell you.  That really bothers me, somebody calls me "son."
You redneck idiot, do you have...
...there's a colonel...
His name's Vitelli.  Talk to him.  He's right out-...
What happened to Colonel Brynner?
...we're all gonna die in this...
I'll lead 'em out.
The usual.  Doc.
INT. BRYNNER'S VAN - DAY. 
BLACK BACKGROUND.
Heat's murder.
Jake, for Christ's sake.
Sir, this is not a lending library, it's the Hall of Records.
Do you know him?
That's too bad.
Mr. Gittes!  You're dealing with a disturbed woman who's lost her husband. I don't want her taken advantage of. Sit down.
You may think you know what you're dealing with, but believe me, you don't.
It's what the D.A. used to tell me about Chinatown.
If you want to hire me, I still have to know what you and Mulwray were arguing about.
We'll be in touch, Mr. Cross.
I've got her.
That you killed Hollis Mulwray.
Oh, my, yes.
Have you got your checkbook handy, Mr. Cross? I've got the girl.
Do you remember the figures we discussed?
At your daughter's house. How soon can you get here?
Either that or she'll be in jail.
Call me Jake. How is everything?
No thanks.
Oh, gee, Mr. Gittes we're going out tomorrow. I know you been real good about it but my cousin Auggie's sick.
You sure this is okay?
I said okay, Jake.
Sue the shit out of 'em.
Thank you...
The apple core club.
No. The albacore. It's a fish. My grandson's a member and they take very nice care of us.
Give us things. Not just some old flag like this, but -
Since when?
No.
No?
You mean that's what you're going to call it.
Why do you think Mulwray's body was moved you dimwit? Evelyn Mulwray knocked off her husband in the ocean and thought it would look like more of an accident if she hauled him up to the Oak Pass Reservoir?
Too late for what?
Her maid's house. I think she knows something's up.
She lives in Pedro. I'll write it down for you.
Gee, Lou, I'm doing the best I can.
Lou, she will kill you. Let her go for now. You don't know.
But there is no possibility he would have taken his own life?
He... we did... he wouldn't tell me her name.  We quarreled over her... of course. It came as a complete surprise to me.
Yes, that Mulwray, Mr. Gittes. And since you agree with me we've never met, you must also agree that I haven't hired you to do anything. Certainly not spy on my husband. I see you like publicity, Mr. Gittes. Well, you're going to get it.
Yeah. Fine, thank you.
I don't want to drop it.
What do you mean?
Looks like you went quite a distance.
I'll stop by.
...Just a minute...
Oh... thank you.
How did you find out?
He told you?
She's cheating on him.
Another satisfied client's wife.
Wait a minute, sonny.  I think you better come with me.
Money. How they plan to make it by emptying the reservoirs, that I don't know.
What dam?
No.
Is that unusual?
Why?
What were you doing there?
Yeah.
You can't always tell what's going on there.
I thought I was keeping someone from being hurt and actually I ended up making sure they were hurt.
...A flaw...
Give me an example.
You bastard.
Aren't you coming back with me?
No...
I don't know what you're talking about. This is the most insane... the craziest thing I ever...
...no...
She's my sister and my daughter!
To Mexico...
Where can we go?
I think I got something.
Oh yes we have... are you alone, Mr. Gittes?
Well I never expected anything to happen like what happened to Mr. Mulwray, the point is if it ever comes out I want somebody to know I didn't know what would happen.
A Miss Sessions calling.
Help yourself.
Yeah, must be especially tough to take over under these circumstances.
Only when I breathe.
Well, look at it this way, Mr. Yelburton.  Mulwray didn't want to build a dam and he had a reputation that was hard to get around, so. you decided to ruin it. Then he found out that you were dumping water every night. Then he was drowned.
Yes...
Well... I think I... I would've remembered.
It's not completely dry.
Yeah.
Yeah, I'll do that.
Since lunch.
Well I'm on my lunch hour. I'll wait.
They got into a terrific argument outside the Pig 'n Whistle.
Nothing. You got a hell of a way to make a living.
You must be thinking of a different daughter.
...and turn into a piece of charcoal!!
Toto, come here.
Then why don't you want to teach it to me too? Now that there's no more cranking, and it's easier?
No...
OK. OK. But now that I've got a job, I'11 probably stop going...
Just so, Alfredo. There isn't any. And if you buy a television set, you can watch it at home, without any fuss...
No. And nobody knows where she is.
Who said that? Gary Cooper, James Stewart, Henry Fonda? Huh? 
I know. But take the-miracle of the loaves and fishes, for example! I think about it a lot...How is it possible for...
For what?
Sure, sure! Boccia...  What's he do?
I'll never agree with you. Never, Elena.
Six years ago this May. No one came any more. You "know better than me, Mr. Di Vita, the crisis, television, videos. By now the movie business is only a dream. The city's bought it now to make a new parking lot. Next Saturday they're tearing it down...A pity!...
I rather like it myself.  Send it right away.
That's all right, Mr. Bernstein.
I didn't see that.
I can't take shorthand, Mr. Kane -
Enthusiastic?
Well, well - isn't that nice?
Well, Mr. Bernstein, you were with Mr. Kane from the very beginning -
Well, I went down to Atlantic City -
Yes.
Yes.

September the ninth?
That'll be all today, Mr. Carter. You've been most understanding. Good day, Mr. Carter!
We've got a nice plant here.
I'm protecting myself every way I know how, Mrs. Kane.  This last week, I finally found out how I can stop your husband from being elected. If the people of this state learn what I found out this week, he wouldn't have a chance to - he couldn't be elected Dog Catcher.  Well, what I'm interested in is seeing that he's not elected.  I don't care whether they know what I know about him.  Let him keep right on being the Great, Noble, Moral -  Champeen of the people.  Just as long as -
The story about him and Miss Alexander, Mrs. Kane.
Brad, I'm -  I'm not an old woman yet -
It can wait.
Too late for what?  Too late for you and this -  this public thief to take the love of the people of this state away from me?  Well, you won't do it, I tell you.  You won't do it!
Charlie, he said, unless you withdrew your name -
Charlie, please don't -
What's the matter with you?
If these sidewalks were kept in condition - instead of the money going to some cheap grafter -
I'm sorry.  They live here, too?
I've got a brush in the closet.  As soon as the mud on your trousers is all dry - you just brush it off.
You're getting farther away all the time.  It's a duck.
I want to be a singer.  I mean, I didn't.  Mother did for me.
Oh, no!  Nothing like that.  Mother always thought - she used to talk about Grand Opera for me.  Imagine! An American girl, for one thing - and then my voice isn't really that kind anyway, it's just that Mother - you know what mothers are like.
Oh, no, that's all gone.
Half past eleven.
I've got more than a right as far as you're concerned, Susan.
You're my wife, Susan, and -
Susan, I want you to stop this. And right now!
In case you don't know, Emily, this - this gentleman -  is -
I'm going to be elected governor. And the first thing I'm going to do -
Don't you worry about me.  I'm Charles Foster Kane.  I'm no cheap, crooked politician, trying to save himself from the consequences of his crimes -
Won't you step into my office, Mr. Thatcher?
All right.
What're you going to do, Charlie?
It's a good idea for a newspaper.  Four hundred sixy thousand.
And I do it because they do it, and they do it - it's a vicious circle, isn't it?  I'm going over to Georgie's, Brad - you know, Georgie, don't you?
Good.
You've said a lot of things about the President in the last few months.
I don't have to.  I run a newspaper with half a million readers and they're getting a martyred president this morning with their breakfast. I can't help that.  Besides, they all know I'm married to his niece.  I've got to think of her.
That's just a little promotion scheme. Nobody expects you -  Mike, will you try and get Mr. Leland some coffee?
I know you will.
Rogers isn't even pretending.  He isn't just scared anymore.  He's sick.  Frank Norris told me last night he hasn't known Rogers to be that worried in twenty-five years.
If I want to, I can go to court. A father has a right to -
You don't happen to have a cigar, do you?  I've got a young physician - must remember to ask to see his license - the odds are a hundred to one he hasn't got one - who thinks I'm going to stop smoking...  I changed the subject, didn't I?  Dear, dear!  What a disagreeable old man I've become.  You want to know what I think of Charlie Kane?  Well - I suppose he has some private sort of greatness. But he kept it to himself.  He never - gave himself away -  He never gave anything away.  He just - left you a tip.  He had a generous mind.  I don't suppose anybody ever had so many opinions.  That was because he had the power to express them, and Charlie lived on power and the excitement of using it -  But he didn't believe in anything except Charlie Kane.  He never had a conviction in his life.  I guess he died without one -  That must have been pretty unpleasant.  Of course, a lot of us check out with no special conviction about death.  But we do know what we're leaving ... we believe in something.  You're absolutely sure you haven't got a cigar?
Was he in love?
Ask the question anyway, Thompson! Build the picture around the question, even if you can't answer it.
Good!
We're leaving tonight.  As soon as they're through photographing the stuff -
If you'd just let me talk to you for a little while, Miss Alexander. All I want to ask you...
I'd rather you just talked.  Anything that comes into your mind - about yourself and Mr. Kane.
What did you get?
The last ten years have been tough on a lot of people.
It's never too late. Give those cigarettes back now, and buy some gum instead.  Here. Chewlies Gum. Try this.
You've made a wise choice. Keep up the good work.
What better place than this? To stamp it out, you gotta start at the source!
Ladies and gentleman, Mrs. Asian Design Major herself: Caitlin Bree!
Nobody can figure it out. And the boss doesn't want to pay the electrician to fix it, because the electrician owes money to the video store.
I can't believe you're here.
Very dramatic, I thought.
You could've broke it to me gently, you know; at least started by telling me you had a boyfriend. I told you I have a girlfriend.
Thanks for the vote of confidence.
You lie.
We could introduce them. They might hit it off.
Cute. Tell me you wouldn't want to go out again. After all the talking we've been doing.
What about Sing?
He's your fianc.
He went to rent a movie, but he hasn't gotten back yet. Ah, screw it; I'll just lock the store up and leave him a note.
Who doesn't?
We didn't just have sex in the bathroom?
I didn't just fuck myself! Jesus, I'm going to be sick!
What time was this?
We're sorry, ma'am. We got a little carried away.
Fuck that! I'm gonna break my crazy neck on this ladder!
I'll assess all I want!
To the back, above the oil.  How long are you staying?
So? So nobody's going to want to pay for these Gatorades.
Go open the sore.
I'm going to offer you some advice, my friend: let the past be the past. Forget Caitlin Bree. You've been with Veronica for how long now?
That's cheating?
She called you Brad?
The only problem is that at no point in the series did I ever hear Leia or any of the rebels declare a particular religious belief.
Luke blew it up. Give credit where it's due.
This guy is going through all of the eggs. Look.
He said he has to find a perfect dozen.
He said it was important to have standards. He said nobody has pride anymore.
You know how much money the average jizz-mopper make per hour?
Nudie booth. You've never been in a nudie booth?
You gotta loosen up, my friend. You'd feel a hell of a lot better if you'd rip into the occasional customer.
You know who I can do without? I could do without the people in the video store.
FUCK!
What?
Can we not talk about this?
We're not playing in the street.
One ball!! They come all the way here... I close the damn store... for one ball!
Gatorade.
Exactly. They drank it all.
Yeah, right.
It's today.
Paulsen's Funeral Parlor. The next show is at four.
She meant nothing to you either until I told you she died.
You just closed the store to play hockey on the roof!
Twenty-two; same as us.
How'd he die?
That's embarrassing?
Bible truth.
No, because you won't admit to it. As if a guy's a fucking pervert because he tries to go down on himself. You're as curious as the rest of us, pal. You've tried it.
Yeah, but at what a price.
Reach what?
What, your dick?
I got fined for selling cigarettes to a minor.
I swear. I couldn't make this kind of hell up.
Because I'm happy.
I might be leaving early to go out with Caitlin, in which case you'll have to close the store tonight.
Fuck you.
Could be.
WOULD YOU SHUT THE FUCK UP?  WHO THE FUCK IS IN THE BATHROOM?
My life is in the shitter right about now, so if you don't mind, I'd like to stew a bit.
Thank you. Why don't you go back to the video store?
Jesus H. Christ, I can't!
The swelling's not so bad. But the FDS stings.  How's your neck?
Thanks.
You were over half an hour late. Then all you do is come over here.
Do you need a hug or something? 'Cause I would have no hang-ups about hugging you... you know, you being a guy and all. Just don't knead my ass when you do it.
Thirty-fire.
I'm her sister.
Jesus Christ, what next?
They are not.
See? You're ashamed. You know you're out of shape. Take my card.  I can help you tone that body up in no time. Get you on an aerobics and free-weights program.
How do you know that?
All the time. That girl was like a rabbit.
'Bout the biggest pair you ever seen! NYNNE!!
I'm not dealing.
Done poisoning the youth for the day?
One seventy-nine.
It's not my store.
The difference is you exploit a weakness.
Knock it off. That used to be my girlfriend.
Veronica.
Lasagne.
If you'll just tell me the title of your rental choice, I'll have him hold it for you.
I'm not asking about the color. I mean is it rough or cottony?
Rough, eh? Oh, that stuff rips hell out of my hemorrhoids. Say, would you mind if I took a roll of the soft stuff back there. I see you sell the soft stuff.
Jesus... go ahead.
Can I trouble you for one of those magazines?
I hate this fucking place.
I'm not even supposed to be here today!
The guy got sick and couldn't come in.
Nothing! Jesus! I gotta fight with you now?
Like three dollars in mixed change and a couple of singles. People only get the paper of coffee this time of morning.
Why do you say that?
Yeah, right. You can't get enough of me.
How do you figure?
I touched a nerve.
Three including you.
I want you to come with me on Monday.
He gets off on it.
Sylvan? No; I snowballed him.
Yeah. How do you think I know he liked...
I'm sorry, Dante. I thought you understood.
Let it go...
All right! Shut up a second and I'll tell you! Jesus! I didn't freak like this when you told me how many girls you fucked.
Something like thirty-six.
Lower your voice!
Because going down it's a big deal! I used to like a guy, we'd make out, and sooner or later I'd go down on him. But I only had sex with the guys I loved.
I love you. Don't feel sick.
I'm glad you've calmed down a bit.  Hi, Randal.
...it isn't there. Yes.
If you didn't want to go out with me anymore, why didn't you just say it? Instead, you pussyfoot around and see that slut behind my back!
You've been talking to her on the phone for weeks!
I'm not the one trying to patch things up with my ex, sneaking around behind your back! And if you think that thirty-seven dicks are a lot, then just wait, mister: I'm going to put the hookers in Times Square to shame with all the guys I go down on now!
According to the NJAC-the New Jersey Administrative Code, section eighteen, five, slash twelve point five-a fine of no less than two hundred and fifty dollars is to be leveled against any person reported selling cigarettes to a minor.
You said you were here all day?
An angry mother called the state division of taxation and complained that the man working at Quick Stop Convenience sold her five-year-old daughter cigarettes today at around four o'clock. Division of taxation calls the State Board of Health, and they send me down here to issue a fine. You say you were working all day, hence the fine is yours.  It's doubled due to the incredibly young age of the child.
Wait, there's more.  Olaf: sing... 
Does he sing in English or Russian?
Yeah!
She said one time you set up a tent on the beach and you guys did it in the middle of this big rainstorm.
I like the way you think.
You'll be missed.
Ain't gonna happen, my friend. I'm getting that tape.
I'll bet you twenty bucks you don't get to rent that tape.
Twenty bucks.
No way, death-breath, that was too intense for thunder.  C'mon let's rock an' roll.
That woulda been cool.
Hey, let's get something straight. If I'm gonna die, I'm gonna die, but you're always gonna be the asshole, so just shoot, alright.
So, what do you see?
It can't fly in this weather.
A bad climb, no, just another challenge.  What's life without 'em, right, Agent Travers.
You're getting warmer!
Look, I know--
And you weren't looking into her eyes when she fell.  Now drop it!
If you want, do it.  I don't care.
Would you?
Hi, Gabe.
Fine, I guess...
I'm here!  Sarah, I'm here!  I'm here--I've got you!
Help me!  I don't want to die!
No, I think I will, it's safer. I have patience.
I can't.  Not here.  If you want, I'd like you to come with me...somewhere else.
Can't do it.
You got to go back now!
What about you?
You attacked me.
Only kidding...<u>actually</u> I attacked you.
I've gone this far, and right now I think I'm in better shape than you.
If we don't get out of here soon we can ask him in person.
For the record, whenever you hear me sliding out of control, I'm never alright.  When I secure the line, come on up.
We gotta get out and fire a flare.  It's the only chance!
Forget it.  If that charge goes off before we can reach it, this whole damn crevice will slam shut on us.  This way.
This rope is sixty years old!
I've never weighed 135 lbs.!
We were going together before I ever let go of you.
Forget it.  You're in no shape to climb alone. I stayed with you this far, and you didn't drop me, so I owe you. C'mon, let's go.  Hurry up, time is money.
Hand-holds?!  I can barely see them.
Are you crazy?  Has the altitude shrunk your brain, Gabe?
Enough's enough.  How could anybody in their right mind... then again, you never were in your right mind.
RUN, DAMMIT!!
There's a lot more where that came from.  You're not leaving again?
I burned it.
Then it's a deal.
Were.  Give me the tracking monitor!
We can't and he knows it.
No, that son-of-a-bitch Walker is alive.
I don't give a shit, Qualen!  I had to be insane to ever tie up with a low-life, piece of shit like you.  They beat us.  A couple of fuckin' hick mountain boys beat the man no law agency ever could.
Richard Travers.
We should be.  Everybody wants what we have.
Lets get things nice and sparkling clear. This sarcasm, if I may call it such, does not become you, O my brothers. As I am your droog and leader, I am entitled to know what goes on, eh? Now then, Dim, what does that great big horsy gape of a grin portend?
You bastards... bastards.
Come, come, my little droogies. I just don't get this at all. The old days are dead and gone. For what I did in the past I've been punished.
I just don't get this all. It was them that went for me, brothers. You're not on their side and can't be. You can't be Dim. It was someone we fillied with back in the old days... Trying to get his own malenky bit of revenge after all this time. You remember, Dim?
Good evening.
Thank you, sir.
... used to do everything for me and leave me to my writing.
I'm frightfully sorry. There is a telephone in the Public House about a mile down the road. I suggest you use that.
What the bloody hell d'you think you're doing?
Cut the shit, sonny, and get out of here before you get yourself in some very serious trouble. He rocks the giant phallus which has a special weight swinging inside causing it to swing up and down an eccentric motion.
Missus. Very pleased to meet you.
Sorry, Em, I wanted it to be like... a big surprise for you and pee.
To what do I owe this extreme pleasure, sir? Anything wrong, sir? Deltoid "playfully" grabs Alex's hair.
You try to frighten me, sir, admit so, sir. This is some new form of torture. Say it, brother, sir.
And it just so happened that while they were showing me a particularly bad film, of like a concentration camp, the background music was playing Beethoven.
That's right. Er... I can't listen to the 9th any more at all. When I hear the 9th, I get like this funny feeling.
That is correct, sir. And then all I can think about is like trying to snuff it.
Come, come, come, Georgie Boy. You're a big strong chelloveck like us all. We're not little children, are we, Georgie Boy? What, then, didst thou in thy mind have? Confrontation. Georgie backs down.
I can tell you that I... and the Government of which I am a member are deeply sorry about this, my boy. Deeply sorry. We tried to help you. We followed recommendations had been made to us that turned out to be wrong. An enquiry will place the responsibility where it belongs. We want you to regard us as friends. We've put you right, you're the best of treatments. We never wished you harm, but there are some that did and do, and I think you know who those are. There are certain people who wanted to use you for political ends. People who would have been glad to have you dead because then they would have been able to blame it all on the Government. I think you know who those are. There is also a certain man - a writer of subversive literature - who has been howling for your blood. He's been mad with desire to stick a knife into you, but you're safe from him now, we've put him away. He found out that you had done wrong to him - at least he believed you had done wrong. He had formed this idea in his head that you h
We always help our friends, don't we?  It is no secret that the Government has lost a lot of popularity because of you, my boy. There are some that think that at the next election we shall be out. The press has chosen to take a very unfavourable view of what we tried to do.
Well. That was all took away, son, by the Police. New regulation about compensation for the victim.
Oh well, he met with like an accident. He passed away. Alex becomes a bit weepy.
Sorry, brother. I didn't mean any offence.
... and this... He pulls Alex's nose.
You wanna get up? Well, you've gotta you see... well I want you to lick it. Go on... Lick it. Alex, gagging and coughing, licks the sole of his shoe.
Alexander de Large, sir.
Right carry on. Alex tosses a bar of chocolate on the desk.
No, sir.
Through there for a bath.
Shut your bleedin' hole!!!
Vitamins will it be then?
You mean, I have to viddy two sessions in one day?
But it was horrible.
Psychiatrist? Huh, do I need one?
Oh.
I just say what the other person would say?
Bollocks. You know what you can do with that watch? You can stick it up your arse. Slide of nude woman in bed, a man at the window.
Excuse me, missus. No time for the old in-out, I've just come to read the meter. Slide of bird's nest with eggs.
Eggiwegs. I would like to smash 'em. Pick up th elot and f... owww... He slams his hand down and cries out with pain.
Let me be sick... I want to get up. Get me something to be sick in... Stop the film... Please stop it... I can't stand it any more. Stop it please... please.
Oh, thankyou, your honour. The Tramp takes a second look at Alex.
Where did you hear about this? Whose been talking about these things?
Amen. They cross themselves.
Have you ever had any attacks of fainting or dizziness?
Are you now, or ever have been, a homosexual?
Very good, Chief. Chief Guard turns to Alex.
The shiny stuff. The Ice. The big, big, big money is available's what Will the English says.
Well, like he says, it's mostly odd things he does, helping like... here and there, as it might be.
Sixth is a parking lot north of 23rd this time of day.
We taking bets?  What if you're wrong?
Why'd you do that?  Don't tell me you're a gentleman, Max. I thought chivalry was dead as a necessary consequence of gender politics...
Most of the time.
Like you, I'm good at it.  But at this exact moment in time...like I gotta sumo wrestler on my shoulders until tomorrow morning.
It doesn't matter!  Just get out of the goddamn building...
Seventh, files section.  What should I do?
Max, I'm scared.  Are you sure?
Comin' over Coldwater.  Goddamn deer jumps out in front of me.  You believe that?
You're kidding me.
Was it great?  Better than great, it had to be...
I am a nice guy, Daniel.  With a job to do.  You know how it is.
Of course.
I'm sorry.
Can you finish on schedule?
Very generous.
...Petrov and Cicerno for sure...
No.  Your cabbie is floating down a storm drain or stuffed in the trunk of a cab.
Detective Sergeant Phil Heller.
Not our call, Phil.
Max never had many friends.  So much with the piano.  Always keeping to himself, it's unhealthy...
What's your name?
I've been calling and calling.
Vincent.  It was nice to meet you. Visit again?
I'll fuck you up, you don't hand it over.
I was just tryin' to...to...
What are you guys, taking an all-night tour?
<u>So?</u> Aside from I hate talking to cops, they tell me you crashed the shit out of it.
Where you been the last two hours? Your mother's been calling every ten minutes whining about how you didn't show up.
Third, but I still can't tell uptown from downtown.  Tell the truth, whenever I'm here, I can't wait to leave.  Place gets to me.  Too loud, too fast...too much.  You like it here?
You share it with over three million people every day.  You know that's the population of New Zealand?  What's Manhattan, thirteen miles long? That's a lot of misery crammed into thirteen miles.  Read about this one guy.  Gets on the subway and dies.  Six hours he's riding around before anybody notices. Think about that.  Here's this corpse doing laps around Manhattan courtesy of the New York transit system, people getting on and off, sitting next to him, and still nobody catches on. Three million.  That's too damn many people.
You mean like benefits?
Last thing I need is a reason to keep hacking.  This job's a fill-in.
His hand moved!  His goddamn hand twitched!
Yes!  I'm trying, I swear!
Two...
Okay, try it now.
I think so.
South Central.
I told you we had other stops to make tonight.
They're <u>somebody's</u> friends...  You drive a cab.  I kill people.  We both do our jobs right, you might survive the night and come out four hundred bucks ahead.
Who was he?
I'll deal with it.  I will, I will...
I need the job.
I don't understand...
I'm done.  Find another cab.
I'm collateral anyway, so just fucking do it and stop making me a part of this!
Tell her I can't see her tonight, okay?
Fuck!  Nothing's ever goddamn good enough!  It's always been that way.
Yeah?  What happened?
What happened?
It's not bullshit.
In case <u>who</u> checks?
Why me?  Why don't <u>you</u> do it?
He's gonna <u>shoot</u> me?
That cop!  Why'd you have to do that?  You couldn't wound him?  The guy had a family, maybe, parents, kids who gotta grow up without a dad, he was probably a good guy; and he believed me...
Some living.
One more.
That's the reason?
Then what are you?
None of your business.
Was your seatbelt fastened, honey?
Excuse me?
I love her so bad.  She just... wrecks me.  I would die for her.
The guy came right at us!
Drop me off here!
I gotta go, Flip.  Thanks.
Come on!  Six major earthquakes in the last three years?  The space shuttle in orbit for every one of them?
Do you still ride?
I can't promise you anything.
I think you're different.
For what?
<u>Heart attacks happen</u>.
Yeah.
As opposed to?
Six months.  Eleven days.
I have no idea.
Flesh wound.  No big deal.
I've been reading up on it.
Pretty scary, huh?
Never heard of him.
Is he dead?
How'd he die?
I'll be fine.  Let's worry about Henry Finch.  P.O. Box in St. Louis.  He's the last on the list. I haven't been able to reach him yet.
So now they feed us terrorists. <u>To create fear</u>.  How much do you think an airport security system goes for?  Then multiply it by every airport in the country.
If that's what you want.  Yes.
I like you, Jerry.  A lot.
Don't do this to yourself.  Jerry. You don't love me.
Now's not really the time to get into this --
No.  That wouldn't be fair.  Where are we going, Jerry?
Not today.
How come serial killers have two names, but lone gunman assassins have three.  John <u>Wilkes</u> Booth. Mark <u>David</u> Chapman.  Lee <u>Harvey</u> Oswald.
Reagan didn't die.  If he had died, everybody would know what Johnny's middle name was.
Come on.
No...!  But they trained me to. M.K. ULTRA.  EX-CATCHER.  America works.  Get rid of the crazy people, the lone gunmen, and the system still works.
Can't give you the details because I can't remember.  I went to court to kill him.  At the Ezekiel Walters hearing.  I was supposed to shoot him at the press conference.  You were there. That's the first time I saw you.
Because he believed me.
They'll trace it.
Without a love of my own.
You knew just what I was there for.
It's up.  Love gives you wings. You can fly away from here.
Now she tells me.
Could you be a little more specific?
Alright.  You can see her.  But she can't see you.
A dog bit it.
It was mind control.  <u>Manchurian</u> <u>Candidate</u> kind of stuff, right?
Terminal?
Missionary?  Penance?  You talk about it like it was a religion.
And what did I say?
Yes, that's right.
Jerry is dangerous.  Jerry has killed --
I need to speak with an Agent Lowry.
I don't know if you're the best lawyer I've got or a high school sophomore.
This doesn't make sense.
You don't understand --
I don't know.  Didn't see him.
It's his show for now.  Look, you want to get some dinner?  Inter- Agency cooperation and all?
Your call.  Have a good night.
Go ahead.  We'll be right down.
Where do you think Jerry is?
I'm going to find him.  Because he'd find me.
I don't think so.
Pull the plug.  Get her out of there.
I don't know.  Ultimately their motives may be as incomprehensible as their technology.
You're --
Then disagree but don't stand in my way!
'President's Science Advisor' -- so what, you just spend all your time jetting around on Air Force One now...?
Did I tell you we've expanded the search spectrum?  We're including several other possible magic frequencies -- not just the hydrogen line anymore.  I was trying to get inside their heads, y'know?  And I started thinking, what other constants are there in the Universe besides hydrogen, and then suddenly it was so obvious -- transcendantals, right?  So we've been trying variations of pi...
You can't just pull the plug, David.
The difference being what -- that I refuse to adopt the standard line, that I don't care about the results of my work?  Well, I do care.  Of course any discovery has to be verifiable, of course it must be subject to all rigors of scientific method, but I refuse to go around pretending I'm some kind of dispassionate automaton when it's obvious to anyone with a brain I'm just not.
David --
You were right, Ellie.  You were right all along.
Ellie... you should know that I'm no longer the President's Science Advisor.
Good luck, David.
What would you have me say, David?
A transport.  So are they coming or are we going?
No primer.
I'm sorry I couldn't be there for you, sweetheart.
That's my scientist.
You contacted us.  We were simply listening.  We've been listening for millions of years.
We don't know.  Whoever they were, they were gone long before we ever got here.
But you said you wanted to help -- don't you see what it would mean?
I find it convenient to keep my interests... mobile.  Anyway, I've had my fill of life on the ground. After spending much of this century pursuing the evils and pleasures the world has to offer -- after outliving three wives and two children...  I find I've had quite enough of planet Earth.
That would seem to be the question of the hour.  I want to build it, Doctor.  Of course I'm already lobbying through the usual channels of influence and corruption -- but as I said, my colorful past has made many of those channels... difficult to navigate. I need someone on the inside.
That's my girl.  Done.
Oh, not quite yet.  At least for their sake...  ... I hope it's not.  Because they're running out of time.
Can't.  Doctor's orders.  The low oxygen/zero gravity environment is the only thing keeping the cancer from eating me alive.  It's all right -- I like it here. Ever try sex in zero-G?
I do.  More than anything.  But I am also a realist.  Soon this... what is your charming term -- ?  Dog and pony show will finally be over, and I will go home.
Keep it down, okay?  Drumlin thinks I'm enough of a flake as it is.  Look -- everyone here has their little fetishes.  Caven goes to topless bars, Vernon's got his carnivorous plants... mine just happens to be extraterrestrial intelligence.
This is a chance to be of enormous help to other people's research -- to have the power to be a real advocate where David's got blind spots --
Peter, what are you talking about? What malfunction?  What day is this?
And there's no chance you had this experience simply because some part of you needed to have it?
I never knew my mother.  My father died when I was nine.
In other words, God is one hell of an engineer.
What'd you think?
I don't follow.
It's getting late...
Please, Palmer -- if you care for me at all, don't push this now --
And yet that's always how I seem to end up, isn't it?  If you really do love me, Palmer, you'll leave.  Now.  Please.
Hi.
It also makes God enormous.  I think of the scope of your universe, Ellie... and it takes my breath away.  As it will everyone else's.
How would you propose we handle it, Doctor?
Nobody is proposing we censor the truth here, Doctor.  We're simply talking about putting a mechanism in place --
Recommendations?
Git your shovel and git to work.
Git movin', I said.
We work down in the ditch?
I'll make it a dollar.
I've got this weak heart. Too much drinking, I guess. As soon as they find out about it, they'll probably send me someplace else.
I allus hoped to see you well fixed and have me a crop of grandkids to kiss and fuss around with.
We allus thought you was strong enough to carry it. Was we wrong?
Well, I don't know, I just wash my hands of it, I guess I just got to love you and let go.
What are you doin' here?
I ain't askin' what you'll do after you get out, because I'm gonna be dead and it don't matter.
Gotta go, Arletta.
Sure he's got kings but you still gotta call him.
You steal a car?
Yeah. Come on out, Luke.
Boss, you don't need reasons to hit me.
I... I... I...
Yes, Boss. I got it right.
No, Boss! I won't. I won't. I got my mind right. I got it right, Boss. Please don't hit me no more.
Yes, Boss.
She's on to him. You shoulda waited fer me to git her out -- loose like she is, he kin run her crazy.
I'll give you fifty cents.
Borrowin'.
Mah baby! We're diggin' and dyin' but our boy Luke is lovin' and flyin'.
A cold drink? You mean one cold drink? To feast yore starvin' fishy l'il eyes on The Picture? A true vision of Paradise itself? With two of the angels right there in plain sight a- friskin' round with mah boy?
A Lucas Jackson.
I just always did like truck rides.
Your Lucille? Man, you better put them glasses back on and take a look at yourself.
That's what you're gonna have to do.
They ain't never seen a bull gang before.
Like an elephant.
He's the champeen hog-gut of this camp. Hell, I seen him eat ten choc'lat bars and seven cold drinks in fifteen minutes. He kin eat busted bottles and rusty nails, any damn thing. If you'd so kindly oblige as to let me cut off your yankee head, he'd even eat that.
You just said he could eat anything.
Dear Boys. Playing it cool. Wish you were here. Love, Cool Hand Luke.
Your Luke's got more guts than brains.
That fool. That damn fool.
I know he's got a paira kings. He don't have to stick 'em in my ear.
All the bears gonna be walking today.
Well, how far didya get?
A phoney? Whatta you mean, a phoney?
What are you talking about?
You've been having bad luck with masters, haven't you? Your last one left you when the cops came... and now Luke. You should complain to the S.P.C.A.
Would you please get your hands off my face, Tallulah?  What happened to the newspaper?
Well!  Aren't we the daring one? What's morbid and ghastly enough in the news to make Doctor Helen set foot outside her door?  The antenna is gone off her car again.  I had no music, all the way to the market.  Let me find a garage for it?
Andy?  When a three-year-old says there's a monster under the bed, you don't say 'forget it'.  You look under the bad.  I'm three years old.  Call the prison.
Oh my God!  Help!  HE'S READING A NEWSPAPER!
Okay.  You win.  'Dirty Harry' coming up.
Reminded me that I used to be attractive.  That men used to want me...
Oh, God, I forget.  Yes.  Yes.  You go.  Poor thing, you ought to get out.
I know.  Do come and meet your guest.
But </u>alive</u>!
You talked to me.  Do you remember?
Oh, God, uniforms, more stress. Let her sleep.  It's a self-limiting: she hyperventilates till she passes out, then her breathing goes back to normal, and she wakes up singing like a lark.  We know, don't we, Princess?  Give her a couple of hours.  I know about this.
Only part.  What else?  What did you think of his claim that he tied this girl to the tree and set fire to her because Joan of Arc told him to do it.
Shut up -- I'm talking.  You got felony breaking and entering, burglary, felonious...
I'm trying to tell you.  It's on the lady's pillow...
She don't want it.
I sent it by private courier, he didn't give it to you?  That son of a gun...!
It's Daryll Lee Cullum, isn't it?
I don't care -- she's a cop.  That's the important thing.  Cop-ness, not sex-ness.  It won't be perfect, but it'll be good.
You know where.
No.  Not yet.
If he's not out, why are they here?
Well, let's thank God you and Inspector Goetz are on the case, then.
Oh, my God, no!  I'm a clinical hysteric, with panic syndrome, and anxiety neurosis, agoraphobic, I'm afraid of everything, real and imaginary.  I never leave this apartment now.  Nobody ever comes here.  I just wanted to get your attention.  I write and I used to lecture on these crimes, but... I'm not competent.
How did you know they were stockings?
It's too big a file to copy to a disk.
I don't look at pictures.  I look at the <u>real thing</u>.  I don't feel infected.
You're saying it's the same man, but he's changed his style?  That doesn't happen.  These men are robotic; the murder is like a ritual.  The method itself is part of the pleasure...
Have you got a warrant?  Get the hell out o here!  This is the <u>only space I have left in the</u> <u>world</u>!  Why can't you leave me out of it?
So far nothing they test for comes up positive.
That's exactly... I could have taken that same picture, this morning.
What's that music.  It's Abba.  I can hear it.  It's Abba.
He said to send you his regards and to tell you that the Bureau holds you in the highest esteem.
I put my ass on the line, giving you that.
Look.  There's the order:  you wrote it:  DeSalvo, Bianchi & Buono, Berkowitz and Dahmer.  It's going to be Dahmer next.  Which means he'll kill a man.
They never kill themselves.  How do you know it was him.  You never met him.  You never even saw a photograph...
The Boston Strangler, when was that...?
Let me get a little action started here.
I just started it copying to tape, but the tape never ran.  It just did that...
No.  I'm shy and I'm selective.
<u>What</u>?...
They taught me at the FBI.  I was very good at it.  It scared me... I liked it.
Sir, Doctor Hudson and I see a pattern develop...
It's mostly done, they got nobody in common, the three of them... No mutual friends -- the Landlady says nobody was ever there, she never saw her with anybody.
It's against your rules that I try to help a witness who's scared shitless?  Who's...
Don't try to lie, Ruben.  You don't have the face for it.  I need you to help interrogate the burglar in Hudson's place...
Shut up.
Am I in charge of this thing?  Or not.
Right.
What clues?  I'm going to work Helen Hudson.
Because I think I'm wrong.
What does this mean?  Now we got the FBI, my team is expendable? I'm working my ass off, is anybody listening?  Why Ruben, anyway?  He and Nikko don't even get on together...
You got a suspect...
I'm gonna drop charges on the break-and-enter at Hudson's...
Or the F.B.I.?
She left you, Nikko.  She's not your responsibility.  She takes very good care of herself.  If she wants to romance the kid, it ain't your business.  Your business is to snap out of it.
Don't give me six years!  You never divorced Patty, did you?  So what'd you expect from M.J.?
Then you shoulda known she wasn't buying.  She was just long-term leasing' you.  Ah, Nickie.  Except for that rare twenty-second twitch, there ain't nothin' about sex I don't hate. But of course, I'm Irish.  Plus I got <u>real</u> problems.  I'm worried I might have to put you in over M.J.  There's something going on here, the Commissioner is targeting her now, I can't leave a woman in that position.  But the thing is, how can I move <u>you</u> in, if you go on acting like a teenage asshole?
Why don't we save it for later? It's almost time for Letterman.
I've been thinking about that, about you and Karen.
I'll listen for you buzzing over.
The sergeant asked me to identify it. He didn't believe you'd gotten out alive.
What about his wife? The woman doctor? Have you visited her yet?
Vaughan isn't interested in pedestrians.
At home. I couldn't face all this traffic.
I'd like to go back. James...
Were you badly hurt? I think we saw each other at the hospital.  I don't want the car. In fact, I was appalled to find that I have to pay a small fee to have it scrapped.
I'll wear a bloody kimono if I want to.
Yes. I didn't plan it that way.
Are you still involving me in your crash?
Hard to say.
It's not the police. It's the Department of Transport. Internal politics. It's a joke. They have no idea who we really are
Is that why you drive this car? I take it that you see Kennedy's assassination as a special kind of car-crash?
We discourage family visits for the first 48 hours after an emotional trauma like the kind you've experienced.
All I want you to do is think about what's best for you. Really think about it.
Mom won't miss your wedding. She'll come around. I promise she will.
I'll talk to her, and to Dad, too.  A few wisely-chosen guilt tactics and they'll be ours.
Please, Letty.
Really?
But everything's OK?
Thanks so much for planning it, Letty. Jake's really looking forward to it.
Mom and I fought for 20 minutes over whether we should go with ecru invitations or brilliant white.
You don't have to make any decisions tonight.
Especially with a promotion in the offing.
Can I get you a glass of champagne?
We all agree with the doctor, Dear. He thinks it's safer for you to stay here for a while.
But what about Beast?   Who'll...?
You too, Mom.
We haven't. I wanted to talk that over with you, too.
Mom, please.
Mom, look, if I want to dump Paul, I'll dump him. If I want to screw Michael or live with him or marry him, then I'll do that.
I've already made arrangements.
Not even if it's something positive?
Green spot.
It's OK.   It's good to let it out.
I wasn't hungry.
Good God.
No rounds for another three hours.
Wow.    I'm bad news.
Schizophrenic recidivism marked by hallucinations and paranoid delusions.
I'm starting to think that everyone's crazy to some extent.
No way.
I'd like to drink a bottle of red wine with you and then make love to you and spend the whole night together. And we'd get up in the morning and spend hours lounging around and reading the paper.
How can you even mention Spaghetti- O's after eating Grandma Rosa's dinner tonight?
Lie down.
Do you?
No, I need some serious household advice.
Throw pillows, Letty. The sales lady said they're the latest thing.
Yeah?
Sounds grim.
Promise.  As long as we have steak.
No, that's Aunt Connie. Lily is the one who looks like a hooker.
You don't have to know all this by Saturday. It took me years.
I saw you talking to my Mom.
I think I should call someone.
How about something better?   Like a kiss.
It's not another one. It's my sister.  Aren't you happy for her?
I mean tonight.
Oh, ok.   Maybe.
I'm calling in sick.
Yes.
Something you did?
Especially this last year.
I know. We can't just keep going through the motions.
It's, it's really nice, Paul.
I don't mean to hurt you.    I know this is a terrible thing.    And I have really loved you.
It doesn't matter who.
No.
I start on Monday.
What does that mean?
A pass? How you gonna give me a pass? A witness can put me at the crime scene.
Yes I did.    Lose ends are messy.
I thought you wanted Zammito?
C'mon, Laurant, America?
Don't bullshit me, Laurant!   I know about the Van Gogh.
I'm good.   Really.
I'm taking a vocabulary course to enhance my communication skills.
I'm not here to negotiate.
I heard this quarter his profits are gonna be supernumerary.
Supernumerary. It means better than expected.
Not such a good friend.   May I reach in my pocket?
If you think because you're a women this can't go hard on you, think again.
No problem.
Why do I have to pick up the tapes.
You want Zero to kill him?
Why should I have to put it on the list? It's like saying to buy a car with tires.
We'll think of something.
Mr. Bastaldi isn't asking you if you want to go. He's telling you you're going! And if he's telling you you're going to be going then you are going to go!
You know, if you could get your nose out of Bastaldi's ass for two seconds you might see what's going on around you.
No?
Even if we get out of town and go to another airport I'm sure the FBI and Chicago P.D. has alerted customs.
What'd you get?
I'm leaving you with my friends. I'm trusting you to do the right thing today.
We had a deal.
What?
There's just one more thing I need you to do.
Hey, idiot -- I've got stolen wheels and a stolen radio in the car.
Hector, don't interrupt me.
Boy, you must be pissed.
A Wallet.    A hotel room card.    Some cash.
Yeah and if you turned it around it would say to go right.
You can use my car.
And he gave it to us.    145 Ridgeway Road.
This wasn't the deal! The deal was to steal a necklace, not get in the middle of a Mafia war.
Yeah, but you did do it.   So let's deal with that.
Hey, it's not your picture on the TV, it's mine. So, try to be cool.
Stop talking. I'm trying to concentrate.
Me?

Get in the car.
They sort of got away.
Fuck me?   Fuck you!
Yeah, I dig him.
Watch this.
What?
Where is it, Sophie?
I'm more of a whiskey drinker myself.
How are we supposed to sleep with this noise?
We don't know that for sure.
I don't know.
Tonight.
You ask a lot of questions.
The lucky ones.
She doesn't know. She thinks I fell down the stairs.
A little?
You gonna forget about the money I owe you?
This Jade Fox is a woman?
What's it to you?
I'm just playing around.
I'll never live as a thief!
Shut up!
Don't invite danger into your father's house.
Autumn is coming.  I'll shut the windows for you.
Writers wouldn't sell many books if they told how it really is.
What do you think?
I'll write your name.  Just for fun.
Thank you for seeing me.  I hear your wedding day is near.  You must be overwhelmed by the preparations.
I am not an aristocrat, as you are... but I must still respect a woman's duties.
Look at the trouble you've caused. Now you know what Giang Hu life is really like.  If you think of me as your sister, let me give you some sisterly advice.  You can run from marriage, but not your parents.
Go back to them first.  Then you can decide about Lo.
Come and get it if you can.
Jen!
Give it back.
You must decide.  You might get tired of this life.  You might begin to miss your family.  If it were our daughter, we'd look for her too.  She would miss us.  Jen... I want you to be mine forever.  I will make my mark on the world.  I will earn your parents' respect. We have a legend.  Anyone who dares to jump from the mountain, God will grant his wish.  Long ago, a young man's parents were ill, so he jumped.  He didn't die.  He wasn't even hurt.  He floated away, far away, never to return.  He knew his wish had come true.  If you believe, it will happen.  The elders say, "A faithful heart makes wishes come true."
"A faithful heart makes wishes come true."
During my meditation training... I came to a place of deep silence... I was surrounded by light... Time and space disappeared.  I had come to a place my master had never told me about.
Perhaps I could ask you to deliver something to Sir Te for me.
Too many men have died at its edge. It only looks pure because blood washes so easily from its blade.
You always suspected she'd fled to the West.
Is there any place safer than under the nose of Governor Yu?
But your men are watching over Yu's compund?
That's not what I meant.  I don't care about the sword.
My job was to get the sword back, without embarassing anyone.  I wasn't about to ruin her life, or her father's.
It's not our affair.  Even if Wudan accepts her, her husband might object.
I wish there were something more I could do to help you.
Not a bad idea.  Tonight we'll get a good night's sleep at headquarters.
I doubt it.  This thief... it very unusual...
Don't be coy.  I've always known about your feelings for each other. All these years, it's a shame... neither of you is brave enough to admit the truth to the other. You're both wasting precious time.
Then someone's trying to set him up. We should inform Li Mu Bai.
What do you have in mind?
You know, you sure got a hard-on for a guy that's guilty of zip on paper.  Top Dollar runs Showtime; what's the matter, don't you like adult entertainment?
Care for a hot dog?
I need you to tell me what you remember.  What happened to us?
My pleasure. ERIC Don't smoke these.
Funboy had to leave this mortal coil.
Who?
She's still dead.
Murderer.
Last Halloween, eh?  Yeah...  Yeah, I remember.  I fucked her too, I think.
Hey, I got my rocks off, so fuck you in the ass, man.
Another jolly nickname?
A whole club of pirates, with pirate names...
Yes.
Bugger off to the graveyard, skull- face, I'm busy.
Shut up.
Very well, it's your ass.
This is a cobra, Mr. Grange.  Yes, it is real.
Only thing you'll get from that clown is a faster way to die. LAO To the contrary...
Is he inside?
I was wondering if you could tell me anything... about a wildcat operative.
No.
You did?
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to upset you... but you still didn't answer the question.
What'cha reading?
You know you could at least have the decency of telling me who's badmouthing me so I might have the opportunity to confront them face to face. How do you know it's not some girl who's pissed off at me for breaking up with her?
Is that the last thing you need? My your clever.
No, it's okay. I mean I look at you with all your morals and values and well, YOU seem to be happy in your choices. I envy you. No bullshit.
I don't... I don't want to answer that... look we're friends.
I'm not going to speak to you till you realize that you can't intimidate me.
Well try this one on for size. I think I'm falling in love with you.
Who?
Tell me what to do, Annette. How can I win your heart. I'll do anything. I can't get you out of my mind.
What are you doing?
You? Volunteer? I don't think so.
Who's Monsieur Philipe?
That's not fair.
Oh please Annette. You spend all your time preaching about waiting for love. Well here it is. Right in front of you, but you're going to turn your back on it. I'm sorry that we're not at the age where we can get married. If we were, I'd propose, but that's not going to happen. So I guess we're just fucked. I'll move on, but you... you're going to have to live with yourself knowing you've turned your back on love. And that makes you a hypocrite.
Hi.
I'm familiar with a lot of breeders in the mid-west. What's his name?
I shit you not. McConnell used to sneak in my dorm room drunk every month. We'd go at it for a while, then as soon as he'd cum, he starts freaking out. You know -  "What are you doing, man? I'm not a fag. I'll kick your ass if you say anything."  It's like, for Christsakes Greg, you're gay, deal with it. The only reason why I let him continue with his charade is because he's got a mouth like a Hoover.
I'll see you tomorrow.
Margarita found them while cleaning your room.
Thanks.  Nice meeting you.
He's alright.  He kept talking about this bulimic headcase he dumped over Fourth Of July.
Ah duh. Boys. I've never even gone to first base with a guy. What do I do?
Eww. No. That's gross.
Okay.
Okay.
Yes. They're in this antique doll house in my room.
You'd do that for me?
I am?
I don't love him. I love Ronald.
But that would make me a slut.  Wouldn't it?
That's one way of looking at it.
Just taking your photo.
Cecile, all I want to do is give you a kiss.
No.
I do.
Yummy.
Really? Care to make a wager on that?
Baby?  Right on time.
Get out of here.
Please don't tell anyone. This could ruin my career.
Come on Greg. You're the only one who knows her. The truth will save you.
Pretty sure or sure sure?
Who is this?
I don't know. Why don't you leave her alone.
But I can't even see her. She doesn't have her own phone, I don't even know her e-mail address.
Ronald?
He doesn't scare me. I'll kick his ass in.
If you lose, then that hot little Porsche of yours is mine.
Be more specific.
What makes you think I'd go for that bet? That's a seventy thousand dollar car.
Even there?
Okay.
Cecile.
Take a look for yourself.
She's really getting to you, isn't she?
So what went wrong?
Oh yes.
Kathryn, you know I love you. I've always loved you.
Then do me a favor and get rid of her. If not for me, then do it for you. Look at yourself. You're a joke. She's turned you into jelly. What do you want to be, one of those losers who walk down the halls holding hands and smiling. People used to respect you. They feared you and now you're going to throw that all away.
I've never done this before.
I have a flair for drama.
I'll do my best.
Like your step-brother Sebastian. I can't believe they didn't expel him after what he did to the school nurse.
It's Cecile.
Mrs. Caldwell I think you're misunderstanding something.
I need to talk to Annette.
Do you know when she'll be back?
Fine. Could you please see that she gets this.
Don't worry about it.
Ronald, you don't know what you're talking about.
I can make wishes like this come true.  I'll be just like Daddy wants me to be -- play with the other children -- not sit around by myself  tell the truth --
I wasn't saying anything. I was singing.
Sometimes.
That's what I wished on. Edward says it's a wishing ring -- and it is!
But it's already come true.
What's her name?
You can't open it yet. You have to put all of them under the tree until morning.
I know, dear.  I understand. But try to worry a little less about her -- be a little easier in your thinking.  And especially today  let's forget about it. We want a really bang-up birthday party, don't we?
I forgot I had it on.
I'm sorry. I was somewhere else. He returns to the card game.
Well, you know where it is.
I suppose so.
But you told me in the garden-- that the wish about the tree couldn't come true.
I wanted to talk to you,  I wanted to tell you about the other children.
It's true.
It was just a voice.
No.
Well, I guess we're not a very proper family.
You called me by my name.
Oh, thank you, Amy.
Because it knows it can move with the swiftness of strong wind.
It's a warm breath -- warm and strong  warmed by the sunlight that shone on the deer's back in the hot summer; sweet with leaves and mosses.
Maybe, if it's a real mourning ring like we have in Jamaica. All you got to do is turn it on your finger, close your eyes, and make a wish.
That's the clever way to do it.
I do suppose so. But if you were there yesterday, guess you can get there today.
But I saw what it was. It's the little deer.
The ring? We'll have no more nonsense about the ring.
Don't you read Shakespeare?
My Barbara was killed. I killed her. Yes, it was my fault. Everyone told me not to drive from the theatre. There was a raging wind that night, and snow and ice. All was well until we got to the Sleepy Hollow bridge. Barbara was singing a little song and then ...I don't know how it happened ..when I awakened, they told me the car was overturned, and they wouldn't let me see Barbara. Barbara was dead.
Yes. Yes, Barbara, I shan't forget.
That many women in one place -- nothing good can come from that.
I don't believe in PMS. Women made it up just so they can be bitchy.
Maybe that bartender made it up. I mean I think coyotes are rather beautiful. Maybe "coyote ugly" is really a compliment. Like someone who's conventionally "ugly" but is really beautiful.
I've changed a lot lately.
It's not just in my head.
No, I'm not a lesbian. Geez mom.
So don't look in his eyes.
Maybe he's just shy.
Frida, I don't mean this as a criticism, but you might not want to talk about PMS around men.
You're just saying that.
Or if your boyfriend's an asshole.
What a bitch. You should see a doctor. That can be dangerous. George bit me once and I had to go to the emergency room.
Holy shit, I'm a freak.
I ate a burger in the afternoon and a steak and a half with Gregory.
And my bra finally fits again.
He wasn't wearing a ring. But you don't want to date a cop Frida. They're so blue collar.
I'm sorry. I didn't want you to think I was still a doormat.
I think he called you beautiful.
It took me an hour to clean it up. That was not in my head!
I haven't gotten it yet.
I don't know. You have to take Sammy. He's afraid of me.
And he was missing an arm.
You're cheating on George? Jennifer, how could you?
I could smell another woman on him.
So... she was a werewolf. Do you think we can believe all this?
So what do I do?
I think I already have.
Remember what Madame Sconce said. If you love him he'll be fine.
About Mark? Carlton?
Did I kill a guy named Benito?
So you're Grant's secretary?
Oh, a D-Girl. You know... I have a really great idea for a screenplay.
Come on, didn't all that steak make you thirsty?
So pee? Here?
Oh my god, I'm sorry!
I can't help it, it smells so good.
It's Mark.
Yeah?
On your desk.
Are you following me?
Intriguing?
Oh my god, by wolves?
Thanks for the walk. Maybe we could... get a bite sometime?
Oh just my wolf paraphernalia. Some people collect beanie babies... I collect silver bullets.
Oh, nothing's wrong. Just... well don't you have your period?
No. Nope, nothing in it.
NO! I... I checked when I put my stuff in. I always look through the washer first.
I thought we were starting something... and then... I know it's unorthodox, I mean with you being involved in the case and all.
This is a lot worse than "Betty."
Like I had to say it? No, I wanted to say it.
Yes or no? Frida, can't you just be honest with me?
Maybe we should have children. I don't think I'd kill the father of my child.
We didn't have sex.
Packages of money.
Two bags for them, and one bag for your head in case her two fall off.
She'll talk about PMS and stare at her salad.
Tell her I'm eating.
Yeah, sorry. Uh... Gregory's roommate told us you were out with him last night.
Man, you're livin' dangerously. Let me ask you somethin', you always have to get women drunk before they'll sleep with you?
That dude was torn limb from limb. No way a woman like that could have done it. You never seen blood on a chick's sheets from her period?
I can tell she's not a killer. You just don't like her cause you have a hang up about menstruation.
I told you she was innocent.
Okay Lloyd, you tell me how she killed them.
She's not a suspect. What is her motive? There's nothing, NOTHING connecting her to either crime except that she dated both guys.
Like a vampire or some shit?
Okay Lloyd. First, no way does Frida have the physical strength to tear a guy to shreds. Second, why would she be so obvious and let it be known she was the last one to see these guys? Third, she's the one in danger. She's a woman in jeopardy and you're layin' a murder rap on her. Fourth, I look in her eyes and know she's no killer.
I know. I followed you. To the zoo, to her house, to your house...
What of?
He tried to kill me!
You are mistaken.
Yes.  This way.
Germs, sir.  These places are full of them.
A hunch.  He might be able to...
Won't say.  Says he must talk to you.
Shut-up.
What is going on?
No...  No doctor...
There.  Behind the cabinet.  Where does it go?
No.  Have a look.
Yes.
Everyone has a job  -  a function.  Each one teaches you more about your invention.  I'm what is called a <u>murderer</u>.
Well...
I don't blame you for getting angry. You are in a frustrating situation. You must be patient though.  Trust me completely.  I'm here to help.
Not that again...
It's the truth...  I need you.  I know you're innocent.
Oh, sure.  Remember the convention speech?
What the hell is this ?
No...
Alan
Well, maybe I am.  But you're fired.
I said you're fired.  Go on -- get outta here.
Yeah.
I can't believe he'd do this.
Exactly. A condition.
And...
Clean.
We've got nothing, Bob.  This won't work.
I'm going to kill him.
Bob...
... But as I began to investigate, I realized that this pattern of corruption extended much higher...
I was gonna do something with Joan.
The government
Oh yeah... 1'm fine...
I know...  I know...  It's difficult for all of us.  But sometimes we have to put our personal feelings aside and focus on the gQod of the country.
Oh my gosh...
Oh, yeah... probably...
Well... I gues I would... Yeah.
I don't think so.
But we went there.  We saw those kids.
Perceptual?
So we're spending forty-seven million dollars to make people feel better about a car they've already bought?
Yeah... Sometimes they do.
Mr. Kovic.   We're not here about your taxes.
We'd like to hire you.
I had a feeling.
Thanks for doing this, Ellen?
What's wrong with a magic trick?
There's no mistake, Bill.   If you veto their funding, it's not a mistake. If you hurt someone intentionally, it's not a mistake.
I don't know.
I don't know.  I hadn't thought it out that far.
Truman used it all the time.
I don't mind.
Oh... Okay.
It's just so strange...
I run a temp agency.
I can't.
Hi.
Dammit...  I told them no mayo.  See - - I could veto this Simpson Garner thing, but I really don't want to do that...
What about the intro?
All set.
The mainland...is dead...a dead place...nobody there...
SHUT UP, MISS HENRIED! I TOL' YA B'FORE!
That's right. 'Bout eight, if that suits. We'll start out in my gymnasium an' progress on from there...to various other forms o' physical therapy.
What is it if it ain't a curse?
That sounds like a curse to me.
I'm sure that's true, miss. And that's why we're doin' what we're doin'. What's happenin' underground here is just what Lucifer planned for this sinful race o' man. But we're gonna beat Lucifer. We're gonna put an end to what's happenin' here.
You think you can find your boat? There's a thousand little inlets and backwaters all through here. You remember all the ways you turned to get where you are now? You leave yourself a trail?
We always planned to use it. We got some ground up already...but we could never find enough.
The hospital? 
We got a boat.
We're gonna blow up the powder magazine.
We know what's down there. We did the loading' and unloadin' when the stuff came ashore in the early days. A direct hit oughta do more than a few weeks worth o' damage.
You are dying, too.
You have ruined weeks of work here! We've been trying to wean these specimens onto alligator meat!
They will never be satisfied with anything else, Miss Henried. They want human flesh. I'm prepared to take whatever steps are necessary to see to it they don't get mine! Not while I'm still using it!
We're both gonna leave. Leave the island. I've been talkin' to Tricks. We think we can smuggle out one of those inflatable rafts. They're crated up real small. They've got air canisters. There's food inside. Even a little motor.
Need what? Civilised order like we have down here? Christ!
Just....following procedure, sir. They're entitled to burial.
Sir!
In the battle, sir.
Rafts. Two 38s. A little ammo.
Say Steve, where's your manners?  Here's Mutt's brother and you don't offer him a drink? Want some bourbon?
Well, no shit, Sherlock
Knox Overstreet.
Knox, you gotta calm down.
Ahh!  Eat it, Dalton!
So avoid using the word 'very' because it's lazy.  A man is not very tired, he is exhausted.  Don't use very sad, use morose.  Language was invented for one reason, boys--to woo women--and, in that endeavor, laziness will not do.  It also won't do in your essays.
Sucking out the marrow doesn't mean getting the bone stuck in your throat, Charles.  You still have responsibilities to yourself and those who care about you.
So keep your head about you--the lot of you--understood?
I told you, that's a secret.
Miss it?  It drives us crazy.  That's part of what this club is about.  In fact, I'd like to announce that I've published an article in the school paper, in the name of the Dead Poets society, demanding girls be admitted to Welton, so we can all stop beating off.
I'm not?
Yeah, chemistry.  My father thought I should get ahead.
Sure.
My parents made me take clarinet but I hated it.  The sax is more sonorous.
They were walking along the fence past the soccer field.  Said they were curious about the school so I invited them to the meeting.
I'm one of the proofers.  I slipped the article in.
No.
Knox?!
Ridgeway High.  How's Henley Hall, Gin?
Huh?
And if it so happens that you're wrong? If it just so happens that I could care less About you?
Then come with me.
What is wrong with old habits, Mr. Overstreet?
That goes for all of you.  Now eat with your correct hands.
I always thought education was learning to think for yourself.
I... I close my eyes.  His image floats beside me.
A sweaty-toothed madman with a stare that pounds my brain.
Don't stop!
Screw it all.  I don't give a damn about any of it.
God, I want to do everything!  I'm going to explode.
What is it?
My brother went here.
I'll take him over mine.
They're putting it on at Henley Hall. See, open try-outs.
As far as I'm concerned, he won't have to know about any of it.
I guess.
You want me out...  is that what you're saying?
No?  What do you mean 'no'?
It's my birthday.
Yeah!  And just look at this ruler!
I'll come to the performance.
We have to make it to the third deck...
Boat or no boat...I'm going...
I don't know what these things are ...all I know is...
You know what they say...the classics are eternal.
Which question is that?
20 hours on the clock. Out and back. Double for overtime.
Dead.
Then who are you?
What are you people talking about?
You hear that?
...there's got to be a way to access out back there...
You people...rich people...
That's what I do.
Quite a few.
Anti social?
The quiet...
If you blow up your boat, how are we going to get to the island?
Not unless you can wire a missle or fix an engine.
Why don't you just stop figuring and keep working so we can get the hell out of here?
You don't give a shit about anything do you?
That's it? That's all you give a shit about?
I'm stuck...
You're beautiful what you're jealous, you know that, Joey?
Maybe plans changed...
Nothing.
She fucked me.
I know...
Nick, Vince, Albert and John.
Hey! Fuckin' A! Just... just like a hot shit... except cold.
What do you think, Sal? Jesus, you think we'd miss this?
I'll get it! Where is it?
Fuckin' A. It's gotta!
Yeah.
Vince thinks... you know...
In case!!! The gun's in case!!!
Couple of weeks... Listen --
Hey, Nick! God damn!... What've you been doin', I mean...
Angela, I just heard Sal was alive.
Where? Where is he?
Hey, Angela, Sal and I go back a long way.
But you must come in.
But of course! Please make yourself comfortable. Perhaps you would enjoy some fresh caviar, or une petite glace, or --?
I came to see Merle.
I love Linda. Myself, I love Linda so much!
Thanks.
Oh. Fine.
Yeah?
Yeah?
Oh, well...
Merle, hey Merle, you got any socks?
She's out of her tree, Nick. She is straight out of her tree.
Biederman, yes.
Will you marry me?
No.
Great. Fine... Once or twice it did fall off the blocks. I don't know what that's from.
Up north.
Right.
Huh?
I don't think about the shot that much.
Pow.
Merle --
You got it.
More bullets in the gun?
Sit down.
Watch it, shithead!
This is this, Vince. This isn't something else. This is this!
That's my plan.
John Wayne... Listen, Nick --
Hey, Nick. How can you need me?
It's not socks, Sal.
Merle gave me this?
Phantom Mary?
Yeah!
What's it for??
One, Vince... you have to understand, doing it with one... would be... like nothing. They're small, see, so if you're smart you get about six or eight. I mean, if you want to have any fun.
You loaded it, Vince! I saw you!
Up.
What'cha got, Bennett?
Technothugs?
Wade did a little reminiscing.
Kimberly!
It was Wade's old partner... Gallagher. He was behind it all.
Maybe re-animating you wasn't such a bright idea.  You look like shit.
Later.  I want Doucet first.
I'm going to bring this down hard. I've got an A-1 badass killer loose, an election day after tomorrow, and I'm risking everything on you. You're going to bring him in.  I don't care how.  If you do, you'll get your freedom.  An official pardon from me.  A clean slate.  A good job.  A chance to get back with your family.  If you don't want to, I'll put your ass back in the freezer so fast, you'll forget you were ever defrosted.
Fill it out.  Standard issue mal- practice insurance.  All Cops carry it.
When you bring in Doucet.
I've been alone for twenty years. I don't feel very sociable.
Out of the room.
I'm not voting for you.
Got compliments coming outta your ass, don't ya?
Where?
You can't win like this.  You'll only get older.  This is what you wanted!
We have to talk.
Simon Doucet.  You are under arrest. Please come out with your hands in the air.
What the hell are you talking about?
'Bout the same time I busted Doucet I tried to nail this big-time dealer. I didn't have an ID, but I was close. Too close.  Gained the confidence of a badass named Dubbs.  He was going to turn me onto the big man.  He made me for a cop.  Mysteriously my fellow officers discovered ten pounds of heroin in my cruiser.
We get to peek into Doucet's brain.
Lighten up.  You're going to give yourself an ulcer.
No thank you, sir.  Smoking causes lung cancer, heart disease, emphysema, and may complicate pregnancy.
How ya feeling?
Good to know you, Willy.
Of course I will.
They're just outsiders. They want to see how fine Jabez Stone lives these days. They're waiting for your guests, too --
Thank you, Belle --
Young man -- you got me there.
Why? It don't hurt.
No, Daniel -- they are not race horses. They are good old friends of mine. I call 'em Constitution and Bill of Rights, the most dependable pair for long journeys. I've got one called Missouri Compromise, too, and then there's a Supreme Court -- fine, dignified horse, though you do have to push him now and then.
No, siree, it didn't. And it won't -- no matter what happens -- just as long as the folks at the fair believe in freedom and Union. So --  Giddyap, Constitution -- and let's keep going, Mr. Stone.
No! No! I won't.
All right, darling.
That's fair enough, Jabez. Man's got a right to mull things over. We'll drive round again, week or so.
Why not! There's a bill up in Congress to give us a uniform law of bankruptcy. Daniel Webster is fighting for it right now--
I'd like to know where you'd get it....
No, you're not.
That's right, Mr. Stone -- there is --  -- just one little formality. I'd like your signature here -- see. And when it's done -- it's done for seven years.  It's our usual form. Of course -- we may be able to take up the question of a renewal in due time.
A pin, Neighbor Stone! I'm afraid, you'll have to prick your finger -- but what's a little pain to a lucky man?
Well, I'll be -- 
The seventh day of April --
Look here now--
You promised me prosperity, happiness, love, money, friendship --
Not now! Not now!  -- Let me make up -- let me make up.
About what?
Thanks, Mr. Webster!  To the champion of the whole United States -- Dan'l Webster!
Mr. Webster -- I'd like you to meet my wife, Mary.
That's just fine, Neighbor Stone -- but -- I have to be pretty careful of my seats of honor -- where I sit, I mean. You see, the whole country sort of has its eye on me, Jabez -- anybody in public life has that difficulty -- even you, Jabez. They watch us carefully, our neighbors and our enemies, and they see much more than we think they do -- and understand much more. My friends all like to think that I've got the good of mankind always at heart, and I've got to make sure that those I deal with have the good of mankind always at heart, too. Do you know what I'm talking about, Jabez?
There's no joy in it for me.
Breakfast ... Ah! ... Come along friends, Ma Stone's a cook this side of heaven.
Morning, Jabez.
Now look -- here's a list of the people I invited -- they're all the right kind of people -- or did I miss anybody?
You think that's a joke? I had him on there too, but I was afraid Dan'l Webster might feel insulted.
You want me to go around --
You mean that's all you had me come out here for?
Hold the splint tighter -- it's almost done.  Go on reading, Ma. This man, Job, he had troubles, didn't he?
Jabez -- you ought to talk to Tom about joining the Grange.
Jabez!
Yes -- you are right, Mary. I can almost hear the little blades of grass a-starting up -- All the seeds a-stirring underneath the ground --
Yes, Mr. Selectman!
But Jabez -- the washing has to be done --
No, no. I don't want to be idle.
Oh, Jabez! ...  Did you hear, Mr. Webster? --  Now you'll help him, won't you?
But it's true. Take 'em up in your hands, Mary -- feel 'em -- they're real all right.  Aren't you glad?
Say, Mary, how is your shoulder?
Now look here, Ma. I'm not a boy anymore. I want that understood. I don't aim to stay a one-horse farmer the rest of my life. Mary's got to be the kind of wife a -- a big man needs --
Well, thank the Lord you can always depend on New England for weather. We've got enough for the whole United States.
Why, that's just sense, Son. Now a man like Daniel Webster -- guess they pay him high for what he does. But he's worth it -- and he helps others. Makes all the difference.
Fiddlesticks! She don't hear it. Got better music to listen to than that.  There -- that's what I mean.
Yes, Mrs. Slossum told me -- Lucy can't even keep a secret -- Selectman -- my son -- well, who would have thought of that?
The new girl -- Jabez says; she is from over the mountain.
Worried about me! Well, you just stop it!
I said you should stop worrying because I've made up my mind!
You see, I don't care if we are rich or poor -- I don't care if we're big or small, all I care about is Jabez. He was the first man I loved. He never used to care about money -- we were poor as Job's turkey, but none of us minded. Now I've seen him drive the poor from the door, and we used to be poor ourselves. I've seen him get hard and mean, and he isn't hard or mean. I've heard him mock at the church bells -- the bells that rang for our wedding. That's not like him, Mr. Webster -- It must be my fault somehow -- my fault.
She'll be here in a moment. She has a special surprise for you.
If it's the British Minister, take him around to the pantry and give him some Madeira --
Why, that's different!  Well, boys, I guess we'll knock off. I've got to see a friend.
Attorney of record for Jabez Stone. Might I ask your name?
You mean you thought she wouldn't make it out here and she'd come crawling on back, so why bother to pack?
Dwayne Robinson, LAPD.  I'm in charge here.
They don't look happy...something's gone wrong.
Don't you think I know that!  Put Hans on!  Hans, listen to me, that shithead doesn't know what kind of scum you are, but I do --
Karl, I know you want him, but the police are probably on their way. Maybe we can convince them it was all a mistake, but not if they hear gunshots! If you lock him in he'll be neutralized -- now do it!  Karl?  Karl!
This is what this is about?  Out building project in Indonesia? Contrary to what you people think, we're going to develop that region... not 'exploit' it.
I wouldn't think of leaving, Hans. Unless you want to open the front door...?
Actually, I was always partial to Roy Rogers.  I really dug those sequined shirts.
Go fuck yourself.
Whoa, whoa, easy man.  I won't hurt you.  Who are you?  What are you looking for?
They invited me to the Xmas party. Who knew?
I'm going to count to three...
Then don't waste time talking to me.
Oh?  What idiot put you in charge?
Oh...Where does he live?
I've spent half my life on airplanes,			* I can recognize someone who just got off one.  I'm Joe Takagi, Mr. McClane.  I have ...something to do with this company.
Got it...'Roy'.  Now listen.  If you think of anything else you think we need to know, don't be shy, okay? In the meantime I want you to find a safe place and hole-up and let us do our job.  Understand?
Thanks...partner.
I'm here, cowboy.
Bullshit.
Yessir.
Yeah.
Yes, I would.
Come on, nobody's gonna get hurt. If they were gonna shoot, they'd shoot now.
It's too late - just get away from me - don't talk to me now - go over to your place...
Well, how'll I get home?
The robbers in the bank.  They got guns?
I love you.
Yeah, well I don't blame him.
Sonny?  Don't send me away!  I can help you save your soul ...
I never thought I'd get out this way.  I'll tell you.
Yeah... I know.
What do you mean... what am I talking about?  Do you realize that you say that to me every day of your life?  I am dying.  Do you know... do you realize the death that you are spreading around to the people who are around you?
Yeah... obviously you don't... when you put a gun to somebody's head... and you say go to sleep so that it won't hurt when I pull the trigger. Death?  Don't talk about death to me.  I have been living with death for the last six months.  Why do you think I'm in the hospital?  I take a handful of pills to get away from you.  And then here I am out of the hospital talking to you on the phone... again.  I have no friends left.  No job.  I can't live.  I have to live with people. This death business... I'm sorry!
I'm sorry...
But I didn't ask you to go rob a bank.
I'm free to do what I want?  And you think I would want to go with you some place on a plane?  Where? Where ya going?
I don't know... you could have picked a better place.
Who's on the phone, now?  What do you mean... throw it on you?  You knew it, right?
All right!  He didn't do it.  All right?  Now... would you get the fuck off the phone?  I'll bet that really changed them, huh?  Anyway, Leon... did I do it for you?
I don't know what to say to ya!  I guess I just wanted to say I'll see ya... or whatever.
What good is that?  They couldn't stop him.  And it'd just make him mad.  They don't know him.
He's scared.  It's crazy.  I never met anyone like him.  His wife, he's a wonderful father to his children.  His mother - you should see her - his mother and father together are like a bad car wreck - he lets it all slide off his back, he sees them, he pays their rent. Unbelievable.  I wanted to get married ... He didn't really want it ... he's married already!  But he did it.  I don't know why.  I thought it would help me, but it didn't.  I was just as confused and unhappy was before; I did terrible things.
It made him crazy - so much demand, he'd fly into this rages.  And I got more depressed than ever; I saw I'd never get the operation.  So I tried to take my life - I swallowed about a half pound of pills ... blues, reds, yellows, downers, uppers, screamers ... you name it. But I just threw them up and wound up in the hospital.  Sonny comes there and looks at me and just says: 'Wow!'  So when I hear he's in the bank, I almost go crazy because I know he's doin' it for me.
I'm afraid.
I got Sal.
I frisk you?
They're what's keeping me alive. You think you're dealing with an idiot?  Talk to me then.
So -- you want me to send one out there ... Okay.  I'll see what I can do.
Come on.  I want you to see something.
... armed robbery ...
It's okay, you got a lot of protection.
What do you want?
Can't land ... you'd kill people ...
I'm not ... I'm not ... you're gettin' a bus ... you're gettin' a bus ... the jet's comin' into Kennedy ... and your wife's on the way ... what else do you need? What else can I get you?  Listen, I don't know how you can do better ... see that man over there ... the FBI guy ...
We're bringing in your wife...
Come on, lemme load you up...
It's all we got.
Give me the keys...
Sal, get 'em in the vault.
It's locked on the inside.  It's through that passageway and to the right.
Mulvaney...
They make $105 a week to start. They fold the flag, check the place out in the morning.  I don't know what they learn, Sonny.
If you take anybody, please take me.
The TV ... they want to talk to you ...
I don't know.
What are you talking about?  What do you think I'm doin'?  I'm gettin' the ball rollin'.  I'm keeping these people happy ... I'm keeping you happy ... I gotta keep the cops cooled out ... I gotta do everything ... I gotta pay for the pizza ... I'm workin' on it, do you know what I mean?  I'm workin' on it ... Jesus Christ!  I gotta do it all ... I got all the ideas ... you want me to give you the gun?  You want to take it over?
Sure - we like you.
Girls, I wanta apologize.  For my language back there.
Yeah.
For God's sake!  As soon as I'm outta this bank robbery, I'm gonna stop ... okay?
You know, you remind me of my 19- year-old brother - only he's got his hair down to his knees - he looks like something that eats berries and roots out of the ground. God forbid I should say something to him like, 'Listen, if you ever smoke marijuana, just remember that it's illegal' and he storms outta the house.  You rob a bank, but you keep your body pure, is that it?
What?
I'll tell you right now - that I'm ready to do it.
What kind of a deal?
I'm here.
Let's move it, goddamn it.
I'd like to work with you on this, not against you.
They're beautiful ...
Yeah - it looks real official.
Well, I'm only trying to get you outta this.  I told them you were in Vietnam, you always had good jobs, you were with Goldwater at the '64 convention, but you had marital problems...
I said you were never a faggot.
Oh my God!  I don't understand.  If you needed money, why couldn't you come to me?  Everything I got is yours.  I got two hundred and maybe twenty-five in the savings.  It's yours.  You know it.
Did I say a thing against her?  God forbid I should say anything against that fat cunt.
I know you wouldn't need Leon if Heidi was treating you right.  The thing I don't understand is why you come out and sleep with Heidi anyway?  You got two kids on welfare now.  What're you goin' to bed with her, you don't have enough with one wife and two kids on welfare, you want a wife and three kids on welfare?
What'll you do?  Come out.
Yeah!  We're hot entertainment, right?  You got me and Sal on TV ... we're entertainment you sell, right?
Yesterday I received an e-mail from a source. In this e-mail were four social security numbers linked to the gentlemen who presented counterfeit California driver's licenses to my company late last night.
<i>My theft insurance policy will have to fork over the ten million... but that will take six to eight months due to Nevada state law.</i>  <i>But you should know sir... that I employ bounty hunters. My bounty hunters can find these thieves.</i>
<i>We gotta bring him in.</i>
Maybe you should fuck her mom then.
What?
<i>Mr. Cigliuti?</i>
<i>The system hasn't been updated.</i>
<i>I won't forget this, Domino. I'm sorry it turned out like this...</i>
That bitch called me a bitch.
I fucked up. You can't help your greedy black lying ass from trying to get everything. All you've done is put a death sentence on Meeka.
You white folks don't understand the natural beauty of a woman's figure. Those are birthing hips. More cushion for the pushin'.
Yep.
<i>Here's the part where I'm supposed to get all defensive and say... 'not until I speak with my attorney.'</i>
<i>Her car was in the shop.</i>
Yeah. <b> INT. FENDER HOUSE -- MOMENTS LATER </b>
Wow. Laurence Harvey. He knew Frank Sinatra?  I knew Frank.
Yeah. I played base guitar for Pat Benatar.
Hello?
Claremont said we deliver the First Ladies in Needles. Then we go home. No questions asked.
<i>Turned out Edna. had one last trick up her sleeve.</i> <b> INT. FENDER COMPOUND -- KITCHEN -- [FLASHBACK] TEN MINUTES AGO
Then so be it. If you believe what that Indian said we were fucked either way.
SPEAK ENGLISH! JESUS CHRIST WE'RE ON TELEVISION HERE!
Son, with the exception of Spring Break in Tijuana, have you ever ventured outside of California?
Okay.  Domino Harvey is here.
Nobody.
Real fast.
Excuse me.  I'm very sorry.
If I wasn't a righteous Black man you'd be in serious trouble. SERIOUS.
Y'know all those pictures he has hanging on the Wall of Fame?
So, in other words, you are not down.
You come in here at least three times a day.  You a retard?  A buck fifty.
What?
You the man.
We're not hanging out.  I'm being escorted back to work.
What was you saying?
OK, but listen up.  I'm gonna break it down.
I just wanted to know who named ya Sweet Dick Willie?
That's it?
What makes Sammy run?
I'm in here.
I just come home to take a quick shower.
You are too crude.
Sorry, comb got caught.
That's right on time.  This is my friend, Vito.  His pops is Sal.
Talk to your son.
I didn't say nuthin'.  You must have a guilty conscience.  What are you guilty of?
Where we goin'?
Sal, I want my money.
Quit bullshitting.
Make dat money.  Get paid.
OK.  OK.
I work too, but I still make time.
Bring some ice cream, I'm burning up.  Do you love me?
How else was I going to get you here?  I haven't seen you in a week.
I can't be staying long anyway.
Mookie, I told you already it's too fucking hot to make love.
I'm sorry, but no rawness is jumping off tonight.
Hello, Sal.  Hello, Vito.
You're still late.
Y'know, I've been listening and reading 'bout Farrakhan, ya didn't know that, did you?
That's what I think.
I was going to buy a slice.
I love you, Black.
Good.  Vito, you trust that Mook too much.  So does Pop.
Vito, get a broom and sweep out front.
Mookie, you're fucking up.
We don't know nuthin' else.
Shaddup!  Jade, what can I fix you?
Yeah, you are. He touched you. You're "it" until you touch someone else.
Depends how you define 'new'...
Four colors? Neato!
HARRY Dunne.
Heddo Jeth-ica.
Yes, you and the whole Special Needs class.
A field trip? Maybe I'll join you. See you tomorrow.
Come over around seven.
Very good. Back in a jiff.
What? No! Look.
I know I am, Mom.
Is it okay if he spends the night?
Probably because we've never met.
Is that what I think it is?
I don't know. I'm pretty familiar with the school and I've never seen that "X". But... I do know something.
Don't we want them to talk to us?
Why not?
Shift to your left.
You brave soldier.
Shut up Lloyd. You're not married yet.
They can't be real.
HARRY, he can and he did. And now it's on like Donkey Kong.
That's why you have to drink it fast, trust me.
Wanna bet?
Some what?
Come on, Lloyd. You must know someone I can talk to.
You're always your harshest critic.
HARRY, this is my fantasy! I suggest you leave - before I imagine something horrible.
Yeah, right. Why don't you show it to your "girlfriend"?
What do you mean? We can't go in there or we'll be "it".
No. Look.
Now it makes total sense why she didn't want him to know we were in his office the other night.
You thinking what I'm thinking?
Three words. I did. But you were all mad at me and wouldn't listen.
Me, too. This is my favorite part of the tape.
How true. But I still feel I deserve more than you do of this treasure. I mean, I found it.
That's because Captain Rob is not a pirate. We've been through this.
She wants us to show the world what a great guy Principal Collins is.
Yeah, we should never let a woman come between us again.
That's the one I wanted.
That's gross.
Tomorrow night?
"My dream date with Principal Collins."
Go in there and get us two slushees.
Do we have a deal?
Thanks, Pop.
So I guess you'll need a new spot for your moonshine.
He was a big loser! What are you deaf!?
Yeah, I get it. Don't worry I studied acting at the police academy just let me do the talking and you'll be fine.
Good. Good. Good. Well, that's good.
Who's there?
No. No. I heard from Superintendent ZIMMER this morning and evidently he's so impressed with our Special Needs class, he's bringing Richard MOFFIT himself to the Thanksgiving Day parade- check in hand.
Love it!
No... no it's not horse, you see I sold the horse.
I made my peace gesture... the forms of Kanly have been obeyed.
With your permission...
Their minds are so.... They move in strange directions....
Yes.
So the Harkonnens will rid you of House Atreides...
It's a high-efficiency filter and heat exchange system. Perspiration passes through the first layer and is gathered in the second. The salt is separated. Breathing and walking provide the pumping action. The reclaimed water circulates to catchpockets from which you can drink through this tube at your neck. Urine and feces are processed in the thigh pads. Should you be in the open desert, remember to breathe in through your mouth, out through the nose tubes.
I'm sorry Gurney.
Yes. I sensed the play in you lad, but this can no longer be play. Tomorrow we leave for Arrakis! Arrakis is real. The Harkonnens are real.
I will take the boy-man... he shall have sanctuary in my tribe... -- A LOW NOTE on a dip stick is blown by one of the Fremen tribe.  Jessica shifts, Paul sees it, and just as Stilgar begins a reach for his weapon, Jessica turns, slashes out, utters a SOUND, whirls again and with rock behind her holds Stilgar helpless in front of her -- her hand at his throat. Paul moves on her first move.  He races up a rocky incline.
Then I will teach you our way of battle....  you have the word bond of a Bene Gesserit.
Paul... please, Paul... listen to the Reverend Mother and do what she tells you.
Excellent!
Where are we do you think?
The spice!  It's in everything here.  The air, the soil, the food...  It's like the Truthsayer drug.....  It's a poison!!!! You knew the spice would change me.  But thanks to your teachings it's changed my consciousness.  I can see it... I can see it.
You carry my unborn sister in your womb!
You saw a part of what the race needs in the beginning.  In time you perverted the truth.  You sought to control human breeding and intermix a select few according to a selfish master plan.  How little you understand.
I am a servant of the His Majesty the Emperor. I have served His Majesty on Arrakis long enough for my eyes to change.
No.
Bless the Maker and his water... Bless the coming and going of him.  May his passage cleanse the world.
You are about to witness something few have seen -- watch!  Watch!
SILENCE... SILENCE.
You feel the flesh crisping?
Not all of them... I know which ones will.
I have heard of it. -- REVEREND MOTHER It is very dangerous... very painful. The Bene Gesserit sisterhood drink it to see within.... There is a place terrifying to us... to women. It is said a man will come... the Kwisatz Haderach... he will go where we cannot... Many men have tried...
Stop him, Jessica!
My father sent you to test me. Music then?
I know.  But if it is a trap then why are we going?
Don't worry.  I do it every Halloween.
They do?  Shoot.  There <u>must</u> be a way to get around that...
Ah!  This is very exciting.
No hospital.  Just take me to the couch...
Ach!  How do they expect a Hungarian to pronounce this dialogue?  This live television is madness!
I never said I could ad-lib...
That's fine, Bela.  We're still rolling.  Just say "Dear, you're lovely."
Really?
You'll be fighting with the octopus.
Once you're in it, it warms up.
That's fine, Eddie.  All in the line of duty.
Norma.  She changed her mind.  She doesn't wanna marry me.  Can you put down the gun?
Eddie, I received a letter from the government.  They're cutting off my unemployment.  That's all I've got. Without it, I can't pay the rent...
It'll be wonderful.  We'll be at peace.  In the afterlife, you don't have to worry about finding work.
I'm sorry, Eddie.  I'm so sorry.
That's great.  Let's do a take.
Eddie, how was I?
I dunno.  Lie on the beach?
Don't you want a second take, for protection?
No, it's fine.  It's real!  In actuality, Lobo would struggle with that problem every day.
I guessed.
It's that easy?
Ed, you're still young.  This is the part of your life when you're <u>supposed</u> to be struggling.
Boris Karloff!?
You met Basil Rathbone!
Well, I'd really like to know what you think.  Why don't you go in the bedroom and take a look at it?  I'll Wait...
Of course it is.  And that's why you should play the part.
Hon', nobody's bothered but you.  Look around -- they couldn't care less.
But Ed, we're not even married.  And you don't have a job.
Toss us out on our ass.
Well maybe you're not studio kind of material.  Maybe you just need to raise the money yourself.
Who do you think's been paying the rent?!  Who helped type your script, and did all your grunt work?!
That's moronic.  Why would a bit player impress a backer?
Wood Productions.  The mark of quality.
Perhaps a small amount of money.  How much do one of your motion pictures cost?
That's all??  That seems very reasonable for an entire picture.
Well then you should pay him, shouldn't you?
What are you looking at me like that for?  I already gave you my three hundred.
What other sixty-thousand?
Ah!  Atomic Age stuff, huh?  I like it.  I'll tell you what, Mr. Ward.  Why don't you leave those film cans, and my associates and I will take a look at your little opus.  Maybe we can do business together.
Mr. Wood, you have bounced your third and final rent check.
Raising money is tough.
Just, it doesn't look like very much.
Look, Lugosi is dead and Vampira won't talk.   Ihad to give <u>somebody</u> the dialogue.
Yes?
Tor!
I like.  When do movie shoot?
But Tor, it's a starring part! You're second billed.
It's the damn money men.  You never know who's a windbag, and who's got the goods.  And then they all think <u>they're</u> a director...
Who?
Uh, yeah.  Our picture.
There's still a sex-change --
Why?!  I did all those things!  Hell, I even built the props.
Maybe it needs special handling.
What do you mean?
Okay?
Thanks.  It's actually the only thing I know how to make.  Hey, can you grab that strainer?
Uh, atomic energy?
Who's Dr. Tom?
So?  It's only a five-hour drive. And it'll probably clear up, once we hit the desert.  Heck, it'll probably clear up once we drive around the corner.  I promise.
You don't wanna be noticed?
Lines around the block.
Are you IN5ANE?  <u>I'm</u> the director! <u>I</u> make the casting decisions around here!
NOOOOO!!!
And you're gonna make a bundle.  This movie's gonna be famous!  But only if you SHUT UP, and let me do it my way!
Look, you seem like a nice guy, Ed, but you're just not my type.  But keep in touch.  Let me know when your movie opens.
At what point?
I'm not -- I didn't -- Al, you know how I feel about you...
I'm going to be living with my brother. He's not in such good shape as I am, but... I'm looking forward to the pillow fights.
So if it's a show and they have a guy die that's writing, but if it's real and they have a guy die that's murder.
Oh, see, studying would've been a huge help. Where were you, then?
Um, yeah -- thanks.
And all the kids stared calling me "Pumpkin Ass." "Hey Pumpkin Ass," -- for like a year. So, now, I feel like everyone's watching me and, you know, I'm "Pumpkin Ass" again.
That means a balloon payment and a big raise for the second month.
You asked me if I had a dream. I said "Sure, I have a dream. I just don't know what it is yet."
You know, everything you asked me to do I did. I call you for advice about Shari you say -  "Leave her be, see other people for a while." You just wanted me to get involved with Jill because it made for a better show.
This guy.
What are you talking about? He's fine. He's out of the hospital already. The ratings are higher than ever.
Yes?
What about him -- did he suffer any or was it quick? I'd hate to think he...
Really? They were..
No.  The deceased is ... Henry Pekurny.
Tell me.
Oh -- so I'm just, what -- a poor substitute?
Could've been a nurse?
So does Grandma. So does Shaquille O'Neal. You told me you had a hysterectomy and he ran off with your nurse.
What's the matter?!
Hank! He said he wanted to talk to me to apologize for everything he begged -- he cried. So I went to this horrible hotel he was staying in... I felt so sorry for him --
The doctor said you were having sex.
Why? How...
But Al is your husband now!
She really doesn't want you and the camera in here right now.
What are you talking about?
Not too good. That's why it states in your contract that if you do not continue to live a normal life, you're in violation and are liable for the station's financial losses. Ed, I urge you to reconsider. I urge you on behalf of all those people out there whose lives have become so entwined with yours. Play fair with them, Ed.
Hm? I'm, uh... Why isn't this drunken woman you?
You batted or you bunted?
Right.
Okay ...
Oh... how come?
Look, not having been there... I just think you're hurt and you're saying this to, you know, get back at him.
It's... okay
Really?
I missed you.
You should see the one we wear when it rains.
Why?
I really like you too...
Exactly. Boy, you're smart.  Why are you so mean to her? What did she do to you?  "Is she good enough for Ed?" Who the hell am I?  Who the hell do you think I should be dating?
So?
No... Could you?
Come on.
We're excited.
Hey. Check this out.  Look at this.
No. What happened?
She didn't know he was a criminal. They had a relationship. They --
We'd better go...
It's the receptionist at one of the places I service video equipment -- she's very pretty and, you know, she never even talks to me and then today I come in and she's all "I saw you on TV the other night... You were so great ... " Next thing I know we're ...
Cassie...
Yeah. My problem is I've got a brother who writes a sentence like "We grew up in a small, little bedroom." As opposed to a big, little bedroom?
Oh, is Shari here? Why didn't you just say so? Why are you giving me a song-and-dance about being tired?
Who's Shari?
No problema.  You want a picture?
It could be, if you fixed it up. How did you... ? I mean how does anyone ... wind up like this?
What?... Why?
Oh, an TV a minute and already an attitude.
Foxy. . . Foxy. . . You know you're a cute little heartbreaker... Foxy... You know you're a sweet little love maker...
I'm not talking about ethics.  I'm talking about morals.
Well, I notice you don't seem to have any close friends at Millard. You seem to be kind of a loner.
I know.  I know its not by choice.  I just mean, well, being the kind of person you are, it must be really difficult to find someone you can talk to.
Jim, don't.  You're scaring him.
What?
Dick.
Huh.  Okay.  Well, I guess I'd better do my count.
So like I was saying, things were going pretty well in my life.
Look, why don't we just forget about Tammy?  We'll have the assembly tomorrow, everybody'll make their speeches, and I'm sure everything will be fine.
6:30.  How do you know what time the posters were torn down?
Well, I got in everywhere I applied, but Cornell is my first choice.
Anywhere you want.  Just so long as we're not gone more than a half-hour.
Uh, Jim?
Well, this is hard for me, but I think it's important to be honest. Don't you?
I did it.
This weekend.
I have proof.
Your novel? Are you fucking kidding me?
Oh, come on.  You've had a hard year, you're cooped up with the kid all the time.  Let go; live a little.
Dave.
We'll let it run awhile
Yeah.
No way I It doesn't make sense.
I'm telling you. Dr. Hendricks, every vote was accounted for.
So?
Sorry.
For what?
Well, see, I was talking to Mr. McAllister about my leg and everything... and how I still want to, you know, do something for the school and --
Good luck to you too, Paul.
You know, I don't understand why everybody bad-mouthed Tracy all the time.  She was always super- nice to me.
Oh, yeah, sure.  Hey Nolan, give my book to Tracy when you're done*
Okay, Paul.  Thanks.  Thanks a lot.
Okay.  Great.  I feel good.
It's practically stamped on your forehead.
No I haven't.  Do you know why Pierce is humoring you?
That's right.  Our motives are selfish, so we're cooperating.
Yeah.
He had you cut to look like Veronica Lake?
If it's a date I think you'd better tell me your first name because I --
He made his play amd he got what he wanted.  They're making him a detective.
How'd you get them to retract?
What?  That new mystery girl you've been seeing?
What are you talking about?
Let my daughter rest in peace.
Look at a picture for me.
Hell of a way to avoid a prison sentence.
Lynn.
Stensland and Meeks.  What were they up to?
Let's just kill them.
A lot of bad stuff happened here. It's as good a place as any for it to end.
He no longer works for me.  Find Susan's killer, Mr. White. I'll give you a handsome reward. <u>Whatever you desire</u>.
Against your code?
Wait.  Our deal still holds?
I ain't your <u>paesano</u>, you wop cocksucker.
You remember an ex-cop named Buzz Meeks?  He works for a guy named Patchett.
Anything off.  Anything that didn't make sense.
<u>Ear plugs</u>.
I'll testify, sir.  I'm not afraid to do what's right.
Until he gunned down six people.
Nothing.
Man, why're you talkin' about Larry?  His business is his business.
Man, what're you saying?
Nobody.  At least not yet.
I was thinking Detective Bureau.
Would you be willing to beat confessions out of suspects you knew to be guilty?
White's a mindless thug.
Tell that to Jack Vincennes.  To Stensland.
<u>Really</u>?  Would you be willing to rig crime scene evidence to support a prosecuting attorney's working hypothesis?
What's this all about, lad?
That's right.
You're the payoff expert.  I'm just doing my duty.
What about you?
Rollo's the reason I became a cop. I wanted to catch the guys who thought they could get away with it.  It was supposed to be about truth and justice and Rollo.  But somewhere along the way I forgot all that... How about you, Jack? Why'd you become a cop?
I want to do it right.
What?
I'm going to Lynn Bracken's.  I'll meet you at the Dining Car.
With tinsel and plastic icicles and... on his penis, sir.
Of his penis, sir?
Hold on... We need to canvass. See if a purple Mercury was seen around here tonight.
I know who you are.  You're the policeman Bud told me about.
Why?
You cut to the heart of things, don't you?  What about Lynn Bracken?  She going to be a hooker all her life?
You're the first person to ever call me tough.
You, me and White, huh?
I want D.A. bureau men to tail Dudley Smith twenty-four hours a day; I want you to get a judge to authorize a wire tap on his home phone; I want authorization to check his bank records and I want it all in an hour.
Is she?
I need an extra fifty.  Two patrolmen at twenty apiece and a dime for the watch commander at Hollywood Station.
And Reynolds?
You didn't get my message?  It got called off.  The kid chickened out at the last minute.
A bootleg...
Something like that.
Pierce isn't like regular people. I dig him, but he scares me too.
Maybe you should have thought of that before you made Bloody Christmas page one.
He didn't give you an address? He didn't give you a phone number?
Who are you calling?!
I don't know what that means.
So...how much money do you want in exchange for not ruining my life?
Be careful, Danny.
The NSA?
Like a LowJack, but two generations ahead of what the police use. It pulses at 230 Giga-Hertz.
It means the NSA can read the time off your wristwatch.
Pal, you're cooked. It's over. What you did, who you were...that's done. I'd find a quiet job somewhere shoveling snow.
They froze your accounts. Get outa my way.
And you were worried about me. That's nice, I appreciate--
We said a hundred.
One-twenty.
You told me no calls.
Oh, I'll bet <u>that</u> threw 'em off the scent. I sure hope you covered the mouthpiece with a handkerchief and used a funny voice!
Jesus.
Why'd you leave?
What's going on?
Who?
That wasn't so hard.
Let's not do the tire thing anymore, okay?
Tell me about it.
Tell him we're not gonna hurt him.
Listen--
It's Pat Cary. I work for Senator Sam Albert and I was given Jerry's name.
What are you saying?
Oh my God.
You got any money?
Dylan, I was just asking Eric if--
Is that good?
Pardon?
The robbery.
That's 'cause I <u>wasn't</u> there.
About what?
What kind of trouble.
I'm happy to help you all I can. But I didn't see the accident and I barely knew Daniel Zavitz. I've gotta go to work.
Yes sir.
Listen to him.
Just for the criminals.
No.
"Sources revealed an FBI investigation into a possible money laundering scheme that may have sent millions of dollars--
I know.
I didn't want you to be upset. I shouldn't have lied. Stacy, there's nothing between me and Rachel Banks.
I went to the bank to see why. They said you emptied our accounts--
Sir?
I don't believe it is, no.
It's not?
That's not you having a whiskey sour with Carmine Morada.
I'll see if I can, you know, work things out.
When do I get to meet him?
Brill.
It's how he works.
I take a straight 15 percent. Brill's fee varies with risk. Perhaps you'd be more comfortable using someone else.
I wouldn't let you. Good luck with DePinto.
What're you gonna do, Rachel? You gonna sit in a bar in Baltimore? You want your job back? You want a life?
It's not me?
We'd like to ask you some questions about Daniel Zavitz.
--otherwise we may have to--
--otherwise we may have to--
Brill.
This is <u>bullshit</u>. Someone's mixing up a bunch of half-truths to ruin me and to ruin my case.
Put David on it. He seems anxious to clear my name.
Good point.
L.T., in this office I'd prefer you say Italian-Americans.
What are you talking--
Can I open 'em up?
Do I know you?
No. We're never getting a divorce. We were having a fight. It happens sometimes.
Men don't win fights with women, son, I'll tell you about that sometime, too. In the meantime, I've got a question for you, and it's incredibly important that you tell me the truth. Under no circumstances will I be angry with you. This is a total Get-Out-Of- Jail-Free card. Ready?
Did they take your clothes?
You've got a bunch of Armani suits, they didn't take 'em?
Usually they take clothes.
They only took electrical appliances.
I'm a labor lawyer. There are <u>always</u> mob ties.
Christ!
Bobby--
Bobby--
Listen to me.
Bobby--
I need help.
Are you still in Crystal City?
The police?
I honestly don't know.
I don't know.
Someone's trying to destroy my life, and I'd like to find out who.
It's hard to say for certain, these things are--
Zavitz had digital compression equipment. He could've downloaded into something. A disk, a chip, anything small enough to put in his pocket and run with. Whatever he put it in, he dropped it in that bag.
Sir--
You're kidding me.
Dean's with Lyle.
So they know everything.
Resources, that's a good point. He's got resources. All we've got is a <i>six-hundred billion dollar</i> <i>organization!</i> Now god<u>dammit</u>, Hicks, you find 'em. You find 'em and you end it now!
He walked right up to me in church. At the holiest time of the wear. He approached me in a sanctified place.  Kill him now.
You have any idea what kind of position this--
Yes sir.
What do you mean, poetry?
Pardon?
No.
I believe you still have my book.
Now.
It's a folk song.
I thought we were against ownership?  I can stay tonight.
That day, had you followed me to the market?
Shall we be all right?
Don't talk.
I'm just going to find things for the fire.
I promise I'll come back.  I promise I'll never leave you.  And there's plenty of water and food. You can have a party.
I know.
What?
No!  NO!  Don't radio anybody, just give me the fucking jeep!
In my room.
What's the matter with you?
What do we find in the desert? Arrow heads, spears.  In a war, if you own the desert, you own North Africa.
Good, we're all here?  A toast, to the International Sand club - may it soon resurface.
Yes.  It was.  Thanks for the compass. I'll look after it for you.
Goodbye, my friend. They shake hands.
There is no God.  But I hope someone looks after you.
Shut-up!
You're the prettiest girl I ever saw.
Just kiss me.  It would mean such a lot to me.
Thank you.
I slept with the girl.  I've got a wife in Tripoli.  A girl comes up and points at you, you only see trouble.
Don't cut me.
So you can shoot a pistol?
Where've you been?
You should be happy.  What were you going to do for him when it ran out? He pulls out more phials from his jacket.
What?  How could he have?  When?
I don't know what that means.
No-one should own music.  The real question is who wrote the song?
What's happened?  Kip!  What's happening? Don't shoot, please, don't shoot anybody.
She can take you as far as Florence.
Finally!  So you're our Canadian pickpocket?
I've had a drink.  Fatal.
I see.
The rest meant nothing to me.
Darling, for goodness' sake!
Isn't it?  Wedding present from Katharine's parents.  I'm calling it Rupert Bear.  Hello.  Geoffrey Clifton.
Apprentices.
Very much so.  We are all, save my friend here.
Thank you.
Candaules
I can already see.
Are you crazy?
Well then - yes.  Of course.
K is for Katharine.
Why?  Is he staying?
I don't think it does.  Anyway, he's indifferent to me.
You'd better be.
Never heard of it.
No!

The Germans were here.  The Germans were all over this area.  They left mines everywhere.  Pianos were their favorite hiding places.
Is something funny?
Thank you.
This is what I do.  I do this every day.
Of course.  When?
Is that what you think?  Is that what you think I think?
I'll always go back to that church.
I need morphine.  A lot.  And a pistol.
I'd like to spend a night with you in a bed.
I had a hotel room.
This is making me incredibly angry.
How awful.  What will you do?
Hana, we have discovered a shared please - the boy and I.
How do you know you're not German if you don't remember anything?
I hardly knew the guy. Why be impolite to strangers?
He unscrewed the bolts, reset them on rollers, then slid the whole frame away. No more effort than it takes to vacuum a floor.
Let a thousand flowers bloom. Chairman Mao.
He's on to something bigger.
Where did you hear that, one of those American talk shows?  Check, please.
I'll call an ambulance.
You seemed to be handling everything quite nicely.
Maybe the thief thought you had something valuable. You are in the business, that's what Roki says.
So what?
Oh, that's quite all right. No charge.
That's my girl.
Can you follow simple directions?
Not bad. I didn't expect you to make it out.
Got it.
We're only going one way.
I'm not the one to ask...
Certainly not mine. Come on.
I'm a thief. Sue me.
I'm impressed. Can't spot a thing.
My job, my rules. We've got a job to do. No mixing business and pleasure.
It is.  Coffee and fruitloops or whatever you eat in the kitchen. We'll start in twenty minutes.
They're having a farewell party the last night. Before the Mask goes back to Taiwan.
We go underwater?
You don't get the Mask code unless I go.
No one <u>needs</u> anything except food and shelter. The rest we just want.
We get the Mask I'll tell you.
Without the Mask it doesn't matter.
Try laps. Say a hundred.
It was a long time ago.
A dozen times.
Charged?
Straight down the drive, right at the hedgerow, follow the lane. Don't blink, you'll miss it.
Terrified. Still am.
So you had to be your own lifeline.
It's a party.
Got it.
There is no big job.
A billion dollars.
Get the hell in.
Okay, 80-20--
My eighty, your twenty, smart guy--
Okay, look, I'm delivering this to a man who's going to give us the key to our job. But it's pointless to try to explain it yet. You just have to trust me. I don't have any more secrets.
Would you quiet down! Just for a minute?
My job, my rules.
A parting gift from the Empire.
You've thought of everything.
That's the beauty of it. There's only one tiny window of time when this will work. At the handover of Hong Kong--from Britain to China. The handover from them to us.
There's no way to practice this. And no time. Besides, I've planned it all. There aren't any surprises.
Feeling old?
Let me guess. His retinal plate is in there.
Packed.
That would be Thibadeaux. The cop I work for every now and then. Catching thieves. The really good ones--the ones who imitate me.
Which is--
This better be worth 1t.
It better be worth it for me.
The early bird gets the damn worm.
You damn well thought wrong.
Check out my ball.
Thought you had to use some of these.
We wear so many goddam masks after a while they get stuck to our faces, you know? And they don't come off. But when you find the one person who really knows you, and then you lose her...
Probably not.
What the fuck did you do with my stuff?
Right.  Lap-dancers are people too.
Nothing you can't show up for with a stain.
Which one?
What's your point?
The what?
... just wanna be a good mom, a nice person, a decent citizen.  Just wanna take good care of my kids.  You know?
You did?  Wow, sorry about that.  Listen, Mario's a little not so bright.  He seems to think that you said --
I don't need pity.  I need a paycheck.  And I've looked, but when you've spent the last six years raising babies, it's real hard to convince someone to give you a job that pays worth a damn.  So I figure, since you're the one who said I was gonna be okay, you should be the one to hire me.
I'm <u>not</u> everyone else, Mr. Masry.  I'm someone you made promises to that you didn't deliver on.  I trusted you.  With my kids' well-being.  Now, I'm smart, and I'm hard- working, and I'll do anything.  But if you think I'm leaving here without a job, you got another thing coming.
Don't bother.
He wanted you to know the legal limit for hexavalent chromium, is .05 parts per million.  And that at the rate you mentioned, .58, it could be responsible for the cancers in that family you asked about. The Irvings.
Course I did.
So far.  But that place is a pig sty.  I wouldn't be surprised if there's more.
It's not about working hard --
I don't remember seeing any ponds up there.
Yeah?  Then gimme another raise.
Really?  It makes me sick.
Well, good, Ed.  I like working with you too.
I'm thinking ... I wish someone else had to make this decision.  50 thousand bucks is more than any other California toxic plaintiff has gotten. Ever.  But ...
Look, you said you weren't feeling great.  I thought you should rest.
"Fun?"  Jesus, "<u>fun</u>?"  I kill myself for a year and a half, hand you the best case of your life on a God damn silver platter, remind you of why you became a lawyer in the first place, and you think of me as "fun?"
No one's taking anything --
I'm not gonna fire you.  I wanted to.  But then you got sick, and that woulda made me look like a shit.  You embarrassed me, Erin.
Because.  They know the evidence; they know they're gonna lose a jury trial.  Maybe they wouldn't lose 400 million bucks, but once you factor in all they'd spend on this case in the next ten years, it makes a lot of --
Five years, maybe, for a trial.  Double that for the appeal.
This isn't doctor's orders.  It's mine.  I'm saying you can't come.
Oh, now don't get all jealous, Ed.  I got a little something for you, too.
Say you'd be the luckiest son of a bitch on Earth if I didn't up and quit over all this.
How do you know that?
Sixty-nine.  We've got good answers to all of 'em.
That's right.
What do you mean?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Oh, yeah.  Definitely.  Highly toxic, highly carcinogenic.  Bad, bad stuff.
Have you been to the water board?
Oh, come on, where's your sense of adventure?  We're going someplace you never been before.
You never fall short for the work people.  I guess maybe you just love them more.
You don't know six hundreds plaintiffs' numbers by heart.
You got more than one?
Yeah, and whose fault is that?
Yeah, we'll just see about that, won't we?
Fixing a leak under your sink.
Well, I'm sure as hell not what I thought I was gonna be.  I was supposed to have one of those great lives, with everything all laid- out and perfect.  I mean, hell -- I was Miss Wichita, for God's sakes.  Did I tell you that?  You live next door to a real live beauty queen.  I still got the tiara.  I kept it cause I thought it meant something.  I thought it meant I was gonna do something great with my life.  I thought it proved I was gonna grow up to be someone.
I can't.  Look -- this job -- it's the best thing that ever happened to me.  I mean it. For the first time in my life, I got people respecting me.  Up in Hinkley, I walk into a room and everyone shuts up just to hear what I got to say.  I never had that.  Ever. Don't ask me to give it up.  I need it.
I pretty much knew what your answer was gonna be.
Hunh-uh.  Not yet.  Look, don't take any of 'em on your bike, okay?  Call a cab if you wanna go somewhere.
That's okay.  I understand.
Yes.  It's called accountability.
You're clever.  I'm sure you'll think of something.
Yeah.  Who are you?
It sure could, yeah.  Thanks a lot.
My daughter, she's bought a big house with a room for me.  I'm going to move in with her.
Next week.
He did, didn't he?  <u>Baxter</u>!
Their parents, I'm pretty sure.
You did?
Yes, Admiral .... soon.
You must.  Luke, look at me!
Growls a reserved greeting.
What happened?
Howls.
Help you I can ... yes ... yes.
A great warrior?  Not many on those.  Wars don't make one great.
Can't get your ship out?  Have you tried?  Have you tried?
Mine!  Mine!  Or I'll help you not.
Patience.  It's time to eat.
Oh, your father ... a powerful Jedi was he, powerful Jedi.
Then I'll see you in Hell.
Yes ... yes.  That would be a great asset.
He's checking out a meteorite that hit near him. He'll be in soon.
You're an extraordinary fighter. I hate to lose you.
What is it?
I do hope he's all there ... if you take my meaning.  I would hate to see Master Luke develop a short circuit ...
If I may say so, Sir, I noticed earlier that the entire main para- light system seems to be damaged.
Good.  Soon as we're clear, we'll kick this baby into hyperdrive.
You said you were going to stay. What happened?
I'd just as soon kiss a wookiee.
What was it?
Come on, your highness, are you telling me you haven't been thinking about that kiss?
Good.
What is it?
That's quite a compliment.
The entrance is collapsing!
You keep logs?  My, how organized.
Can you trust him?
Something's wrong here.  Your friend Lando is very charming, but I don't trust him.
Look, sweetheart, I'm not going to have you accusing my friend of ...
I'm worried about all of us.  I can't figure out what they're up to.
I've finished my circle and I haven't picked up any life read- ings.
No hard feelings?
He doesn't want you at all.  He's after someone named Skywalker.
I forget nothing, Calrissian. Perhaps you think you're being treated unfairly.
I'm altering the bargain.  Pray I don't alter it any further.
There's not much chance, but the bounty hunter's ship is on the East Landing Platform.
Are the coordinates set?
Not yet.  They're working on it now.
What is it?
We have no choice.  Send them up ... and start clearing everyone out.
Well, what now?
What did you say?!
What are you talking about?
He'll survive.
Why not me?
You are reckless!
I thought I was in good shape.
Size has no meaning.  It matters not.  Look at me.  Judge me by my size do you?
That is why you fail.
They're a lot stronger than I'm used to.
This tree is strong with the dark side of The Force.  A servant of evil it is.  Into it you must go.
Free your mind and return he will.
It is the future you see.
Foreknowledge is helpful, but painful sometimes and dangerous too.  You have far to go in your training.
I've learned so much since then.  And I'll return to finish ... I promise that, master.
If it must be.  Yes.
You'll find I'm full of surprises.
No! .... Never ....
Never.
Anything on the Millennium Falcon?
And we can watch ...
They look pretty docile.
He's a gorilla.
Please
Now go get dressed. We have things to do.
Go on now. Do as I say.
You said I could be Vice-President, Cuervo. Your right-hand man.
What?
Where's Plissken?
I'd like to get out but I don't have enough money.
Dream on, blue eye.
Can you land?
So what does this thing do?
Cahuenga Pass. Make your way up through the mountains toward the Hollywood Bowl. You should be able to pick up Utopia's tracer there.  Once you go inside, you're on your own.  You know what you have to do with the girl, don't you?  We have to spare this nation her trial - for treason.
No.
I give you my word. Put the prototype into my hands, and you're a free man.
Who? You mean Cuervo Jones? He's the man with the juice, Snake. Got the President's daughter. Setting up a citywide truce. Big doings.
No way.
Right over there.
Bluebacks. I'm not bullshittin'. I swear to God.
Yeah. The place kept changing owners. Finally went bankrupt. That thing in Paris killed 'em.
Where's... Cuervo Jones...?
Who?
I don't know. Somehow, I just can't leave.
You're running out of time.
...Perceval!
...I saw nothing.
I sought only not to harm you, sir.
So be it, to the death.
We spared the lives of a few, so they could sail home and tell their fellows what fate they met at the hands of King Arthur's knights...
Lancelot, I will save you... Don't die.
Speak of the devil!...
'Help me, Help me.' Help me get up.
The dragon! There...
Where have you been these many years? Is it true that Morgana--
Rise, Mordred.
You freed it, son?
Not you, my husband?
If I am your judge, I cannot be your champion. When I act as your King, I cannot be your husband.
Because you and the land are one.
There is one.
He has given up.
I will run.
Is that Mandrake, Lord Merlin?
Shh... yes, yes. Sit with me, please... Morgana.
That I cannot.
I won't. You would misuse such power. I have paid enough for you, and I will have you.
--What issues from your lust will be mine. Swear it again.
You strike me with words as hard as steel.
Why it's perfectly plain, your the teacher at the college, you don't want the building torn down.
Shall we summon the writer? He's in Paris I believe.
Fuck it.
And what about the exorcist? Any ideas?
I don't know. No, not really I suppose. But I've made a prudent judgement that it meets the conditions set down in the Ritual.
You're telling me that, I should take my daughter to a witch doctor? Is that it?
Well, when I went to get the Thorazine I had him to stay with her and... Oh, I should of known better.
Storage.
Not that I know of.
When she's well enough, I'll ask.
You're a nice man.
Good morning Karl. Oh Karl, we've got rats in the attic you better get some traps.
What man?
Yes, I think so.
What is it? A tranquilizer?
And those lies she's been telling?
Ya know, those things to get attention, like saying that her bed shakes and stuff.
Never.
Well, what, for example? I mean, give me a for instance!
Don't be alarmed. If it's a lesion in a way she's fortunate. All we have to do is remove the scar.
What was going on in there, how could she jump off the bed like that?
No. Of course not, nothing like that.
Sure did.
But how?
Could you see her?
Not a psychiatrist! She needs a priest! She's already seen every fucking psychiatrist in the world and they sent me to you, now you're gonna send me back to them! Jesus Christ, won't somebody help her!
Nothing you could do would make it any worse.
Really, what kind was it a mair or guilding?
Yeah.
Cause I like it.
I don't know
You like him.
Well I heard differently.
How do you know?
That's good.
Okay.
That's an insult, I got a vow of poverty.
Are you gonna steal my shoes now?
What's playing.
Who's in it?
In here. With us.
If that's true, then you must know my mother's maiden name. What is it?
Ego te abslovo.
Bon Jour.
Momma, I'm all right, I'm fine, really I am.
Why?
I think it would be helpful if I gave you some background on the different personalities Regan has manifested. So far, there seems to be three. She's convinced-
But deliver us from the evil one.
In the face of the enemy.
The Lord be with you.
Her heart.
Don't listen.
No we haven't met, but they said I could tell; that you looked like a boxer.
I've seen him.
From the psychiatric end.
Couldn't it of happened on the fall.
No I probably wouldn't.
That's to bad.
Alright. You know who I think really did it?
Be silent!
O'Lord hear my prey.
Fuck him!!!
Just a minute.
Yes.
You're not going to drive!
It's our goddamn car!
We don't need you, Frankie.
So maybe it's time we took a vacation from each other.
Too bad.  You could use some sun. Really.
You bring trunks, Jack?
Where are our kids? Has he got one of them in there?
Baker.
Teeth.
No bones?
Accident?
Get your hand off me.
I don't see any ladies here. Except maybe you.
In the attic.  Behind some of Dad's stuff.  Look, Jack can hardly reach the pedals.
Wait.  Watch.  Here comes Dad.
Wednesday next. Frank looks across the room at Jack.
My pleasure.
Lotta water.
Who's gonna make trouble?  Hey, amigo!
Huh?
Fuck him.
Maybe Thursday.  I hear the harpist at the Sheraton's got appendicitis.
I hate your kids, Frank.
It was no fucking accident, Frank. The little one ...
You got weird kids, Frank.
Yamaha white.  Nice.
Try the black Knable.
Why the interest?
What about that waitress at the Ambassador?
I don't gotta go.
Hey pal, I got a mortgage, all right? I got two kids. I got a wife. Besides, he made the deal. There's no shame in it.
What?
Let's get it over with.
I just thought we should talk about it.  Between ourselves.
I'll drop the eighths.
Come on, stand still.
She's here.
That's what I figure.  Probably have us in a bed-and-breakfast playing to the owls.
Right.
So what do you think?
Yeah, well, what can I say?  Dad must've had forty pounds on me. Jesus, you remember him being this big?
Thanks, but I've got plans.
Pearls.  White gown.  Beautiful.
Not true.  Besides, Jack's the romantic.
Good idea.  To Peggy Lee.
No, you take the right.
Okay.
Yeah.
What's it look like I'm doing? I'm tuning a goddamn piano.
Yes, really.  I don't want you to be unhappy, Jack.  If you say it's out of tune, it's out of tune.
No. Why?
How come I didn't hear anything?
Celebrating.  Join me?
February?
Right.  It's incredible how you do that.  Remember things.
Yeah.
He was just having fun.
You could've come.
The tenth's out.
I play two hundred nights a year with you, Frank. How much more reasonable you expect me to be?
Just until we find another girl.
I don't know. Some disease.
Look.  I didn't know when we were going to be on until yesterday.  What was I supposed to do? I had the pianos anyway.
Dignity?  Who the hell are you to talk about dignity?
No, let's stay on it.  I'm sick and tired of watching you make him up into some kinda god. For Christ sake, Jack, he died doing a stupid bullshit jig.  He left a wife and two sons.  He wasn't a hero.  He was a fool.
Oh. Yeah.  It was all worked out before, you know. She and Dad had taken care of it.
There's not going to be a viewing. I figured with the kids and all ...
I can keep the beat.
The flu.
Doctor's orders.
Right.
Yes, it is.
My watch is broken, too.
Look, miss.  We're tired, you have gum on your lip, and we're going home.
You're an hour and a half late.
Miss --
No. We are not supposed to be backing you up.
Where's my name?
Do I look like I'm naked?
What's wrong with it?
Am I missing something?
Hey!
Just look.  What do you wear? A nine?
We're not exactly silly with time, you know.  Jack, you find anything?
Uh... good.
Right.
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. I can't tell you how thrilled I am to be here. It's like a dream come true. And speaking of dreams ...
Hey.
For the kids.  Merry Christmas, you two.  Don't forget.  We leave the twenty-sixth.
Virgins.
I told you, he's got the gift.  Same with music. Hears it once and he's got it.
Yeah.
As Charlie Steinway is my witness.
They must've bought the same map we did.
He's just afraid to show it. Aren't you, little brother?
Jack woke up on the wrong side of the bottle.
Oh. Yeah.  I gotta bunch of them.
Someone needs to grow up.  I won't take it, Jack.
Huh?
Thanks, Lloyd.
Uh ... thanks.
I'll call you.
Job.
Funny job.
I mean, I'd hate to think I'd pick up someone who wore that shit.
So. I'm here, you're here, the piano's here.  What d'ya say?
You know, I'm feeling a lot of hostility from you.
Come on, Ed.
Yeah.
Downstairs.
His kid's sick.
The Stratford.
Huh?
Hey.  You feel like a cup of coffee?
You want me to walk you?
Every year.
Yeah, well, I wish God would go a little easy on the trumpets.
Just dinner and dance, right?
Guess I got a little scattered.
Look. You don't know good. All right?
Friend?  What's she look like? Maybe I can help you find her.
Frank wasn't 'there.
Look, if you want to leave...
So how's the cat food business?
I've given it up.
Hi.
Yeah.  Jesus, you look like fucking royalty, Tommy.
Eddie did.
Sounds big.  What's he do?
I hope not.  He's already busted the springs in two chairs.  Hey, what's this?
Wow.
He's just feeling sorry for himself.  This is it, pal.  Hear me? Two bucks a can.
They don't give two fucks about your health.  The Clinic's where they send the real hard-cases for attitude adjustment.  Look at O'Neill --
Jon, he's hooked up to a full-spectrum polygraph. No one has ever beaten --
Yeah -- me.
Yes.  Pollux bought one along with the original batch.  Obviously, he found a way to make more.
He's your brother, you figure it out.  Maybe he made another bomb.
Right ... like Jon Archer would ever let that happen.
So?  The procnias averano is a South American bird.  The flight here was only three hours!  And yesterday a European swallow flew by! Where the fuck are we?
A few blanks?  Like what?
What's worse than losing five million bucks?
For what?
Is that what you think?
Something good?
Our Pacific Rim stations. These numbers must be bounties. Castor's not wasting any time.
No life signs at all. He's a turnip.
Would it?
The left, I think.  Those surgeons in Witness Protection can fix things nobody's even broken yet.
Don't worry.  I've done my homework.  I'll get Pollux to talk.
Like gangbusters, doc.  Okay, I missed the last one.
You said it, Jon, not me.
Mention my family once more and you're dead.
Of course I killed them, you DUMB FUCK.  And torched every shred of evidence that proves who you really are.  Swallow this one, Commander. You are going to be in here for the rest of your life.
Let's not confuse things anymore.  I'm Archer. You're Castor.  But if you need proof --
Too late, your kid worships me.  And your wife -- she's an animal.  Even I can't keep up with her.
So's a noose.  Now keep your mouth SHUT.
Pollux is -- what?
What's the matter with your voice, Commander?
I won't tell mom if you don't.
You haven't changed at all! Some guy tries to rape me -- and you side with him!
That's your name, isn't it?
What the fuck do you think happened?  Castor Troy just shot him!  What are you waiting for?  GO!
What?
You better get used to it. That bitch Lazarro is getting kicked upstairs. Guess what white-bread family man is going to replace her?
No -- the best part is, since it's a government job -- they can't fire you!  But how can you be sure you'll get the appointment?
What is it, Admiral? I'm under the gun here.
No.  Most of them are in transit by now.  I'm heading over to the hotel to personally oversee security.
It didn't work out as planned. Where are you off to?
I'm not going anywhere.
Call me spontaneous.
Jon, it's the tenth.  I know how difficult it is for you, but we still have to go.
The world can wait, Jon. You're going.
-- Studying.
I disagree.  You think I've been acting strange.  Like a completely different person.
Okay, I have a confession to make.  But you aren't going to like it.
Good.  Because I'm fed up.
Back then -- who wasn't?
Excuse me?
Stop Jack, I'm getting all weepy.
Because my gift comes with ten zeroes at the end...
Uh...actually, yes. Two... good ones.
Im not trying to knock the tire business, Jack.
Im sure you do...
Seven.  Really.
Mary Janes, Mom.  You promised.
Uhh...thanks...slightly better looking though, right?
Five thirty.  Okay.
Like what?
Ringing my bell...
I read somewhere that the suicide rate doubles during the holidays...
She wants to have an affair with me.
Hey, is that really necessary?
Its me, Jack...
Tell me you recognize me, Arnie.  Please...
We bowl together. Were bowlers ...we won a championship...were winners.
Yes, thats it...yes, we went to high school together.
No.
Everyone needs something.
Me?
You still think this is about me, don't you?
What?!
Why not?
Look Jack Im late.  Id love to help you out some more but I gotta go handle my business...  Happy trails.
Nice night for it.  I'll have Louis send your car home.
No, I didnt...thats great.
Well, Im just a little confused right now about why I work here...
If youre into that kind of conspicuous consumption...
Just until the Deutsche Mark turns...
You mean dont go at all? What about my internship?
For us, Kate.
What?
You hear me complaining about that?
Party?  Oh no, I cant go to a party...
Trust me on this Kate.  I really dont think going to a party is the right move for me at the present time.
Uh huh...
No, shes not.
That is the general idea, yes...
Do what?
She got those shoes...
No, I love Annie.  We had a lot of good times, didnt we?
Long, boring, and generally pretty sad. Arnie seemed to enjoy it...  Hey, wheres that chocolate cake...?
I want it...
Yeah, baby, I know what you like to hear...
Thats a big one for me, too.
I guess...some of them are probably faking.
Ill just full yours up to the top.  Happy anniversary, sweetheart.
I dont think Id fight you on that one...
A perk for what?
What are you talking about, Jack?
Im talking about the best schools in the country here, Kate...
No, this is the center of the universe.  If I were living in Roman times, I would live in Rome, where else?  Today, America is the Roman Empire and New York is Rome itself. John Lennon.
Are you okay, Jack?
Promise me again...
No, Jack, I never got married. You?
What do you want from me? You want me to tell you everything that happened was okay?
Hello Jack.  You dont have to stop singing on my account...
That'll happen when you're about to spend thirty billion dollars on some aspirin...
Do I know you?
Yes!
Congratulations. The La Guardia flights canceled but I got you out of Kennedy on United at nine. Am I good or what?
"Sensual blind chick seeks three-ton, rock-hard he-man for deep spiritual relationship."
I wouldn't know anything about that.
I like the sound of that.
Youthful high spirits.
Reed.  Even <u>you</u> can't compute every little thing.
Yeah, you and Debbie and perfect --
Yeah.  You don't wanna know the details.
Put your tiny little mind at ease.
Back on Earth.  Victor's medical facility... We're in quarantine.
Just get back soon, or I start looking for a new groom.
Out front?  You home, baby?  I got a surprise for you.
Deb, it's me.  It's still me.
What is this?  Where's Reed?
He <u>also</u> said we'd avoid that storm in space.  And we know how that turned out.
Victor did.
What do you mean "complete"?
Ben, are you there?
What are you trying to say?  Just because I dress well and like to dance --
Oh, well that's easy: I'm hot. You're...well, you're a little limp. Sue's easy to see through.  And Ben's always been a hardass.  Why aren't you writing this down?
I've never felt better in my life. When do you get off work?
Not this again --
<u>Please</u> tell me you go silent too.
You were at 4000 Kelvin.  Any hotter, you're approaching supernova --
Blockhead started it!
No, <u>I'm</u> sorry, for pushing you out.
Later.  First, I've got some unfinished business.  A deal that needs closing...
Not at all.
Get a grip.  Reed.  We didn't come all this way to lose our nerve at the first little glitch.  Just close the shields...
So reel him in.  But we came here to do a <u>job</u>.  So let's do it.  <u>Quickly</u>.
What I <u>should</u> have done a long time ago.  Applications and patents, Reed. This all belongs to me.
Never better.
Right.  That's exactly what I meant.
Great minds think alike.
Passion.
What?  What do you mean you --
Let's not jump to conclusions, we need a <i>massive amount of evidence</i> before making that leap.
Excuse me?
Anger.  Rage.  Frustration.
No.  There weren't.  There was <u>you</u>. And <u>me</u>.  No variables, no math.  It was actually the simplest thing in the world.  But your head got in the way... like it always does.
You <u>need</u> a doctor.
Sue, I've lived my life unafraid of taking big steps.  And this is the biggest step yet.  If it helps, think of this as a <u>promotion</u>.  A merger of sorts...  Four little words that can change our lives...
Victor, are you feeling alright?
I told you, I'm fine.  It's <u>you</u> I'm worried about.
Please, no apologies.  I've arranged for your things to be moved to one of my condos.  You'll have round-the clock care.
Oh, I think you already have.
For your sake I hope you're right. I'm sorry if that sounds a little skeptical.
Here's the overall Target Area...
Medical's ready.
Phase Two.
No...
In his comatose state...and everything slowed down...no more than sixty seconds.
They'll make up some time, once they get through that and reach the Pleural Cavity.  Respiration Post...
That blip we're picking up might only be the radio-active particle. The Proteus may already be destroyed...
The Pentagon, wasn't it, General? Only you weren't in that uniform...
Before he could breathe a word. He's the only scientist who knows the answer to what we're after. That's why we have to operate --
Tell him where he fits in, will you? I've got a few things to check out.
Attack? Who -- or should I say what from?
Yes?
Meet Grant. This is Dr. Michaels, Chief of the Medical Section.
I don't agree. Just because he's often difficult --
That's no reason to suspect him of disloyalty.
And no matter what happens, you're to take orders <only> from Dr. Michaels, understand?
It must have been jarred loose during the whirlpool.
They're much smaller than bacteria...
I think it's the most exciting --  We're going to see things no one ever saw before. The actual physical process of Life itself -- not something under a microscope... Just think of it --
I always thought it was nothing but red.
You can't --it's too dangerous --
That's what they pay me for.
Well, if you happen to be very fond of him -- even in love with him -- it would certainly affect your point of view.
Look! They follow the direction of her glance, are startled to see:
Nothing -- against all that force.
We could follow the Optic Nerve to the corner of the Eye.
I'm afraid there's only one thing we can do. Call off the mission.
If there's any chance --
Well, we better get on with it.
Walt for the lull -- between the time he inhales and exhales.
Send the following message...
We're safe -- long as it remains that color...  We're in the Pleural Sac.  It keeps the Lungs from rubbing against the Wall of the Chest up there. When those membranes become inflamed, we wind up with Pleurisy -- and a wracking cough.
His Pleura's in fine condition. It should be clear sailing through this area.
Once time's up, De-Miniaturization begins. In a matter of seconds the ship will grow big enough to become a danger to the System. Then White Corpuscles will swarm to destroy it, as they would any invader.
Why not? Because of his gibberish about GOd and the Soul? Camouflage -- that's all it is -- to blind the gullible like you! And to hide his real identity -- a fanatic whose only purpose is to kill Benes! And you made it possible!
Enough to breathe, but that's all.
I could use a lawnmower...
Yes, by all means. We must try it.
Then don't drift down further.
Yeah, I just came in. I decided not to park here.
May I have your ticket, please?
Where's my damn daughter? No Jean, no money!
No Jean, no money!
Unghh... oh, geez...
It certainly is, officer. Still got that smell!
Certainly -
I don't know. Few munce.
...What're you talking about?
Or your fucking wife, Jerry.
I'm fuckin' hungry now, you know.
Huh?  Grimsurd looks at his thumb.
Whoa, Daddy.
Shep didn't tell us much, Jerry.
I'm not gonna sit here and debate. I will say this though: what Shep told us didn't make a whole lot of sense.
What the heck d'ya mean?
Oh, geez.
Well, okay, I'll talk to my boss...
End a April.
This'll be our first. We've been waiting a long time.
Oh, now he's adorable.
Uh-huh.
Yah, that can happen.
Uh-huh.
...My fee? Wade, what the heck're you talkin' about?
Yah!
Okay. And Scotty, is he gonna be all right?
Ya kiddin'!
...Brainerd?
...Babe the Blue Ox?
Sir? Right now?
Yeah, but we have an audit here, I just have to know that these vehicles you're financing with this money, that they really exist.
No, no, fax is -
Jerome Lundegaard?
It's okay, Scotty.
Shep said you'd be here at 7:30. What gives, man?
Ya got the car?
Yah.
Well... I'm goin' ta bed now.
A heck of a lot. What'd you say you were gonna put there?
Stan Grossman looked at your proposal. Says it's pretty sweet.
2:30.
Yah.
Yah, but I - okay, I would, I'd guarantee ya your money back.
No! They said no cops! They were darned clear on that, Wade! They said you call the cops and we -
No! No cops! That's final! This is my deal here, Wade! Jean is my wife here!
Now come on here, no way, Wade!  No way!
Well - it's cold, Margie.
I'm fine - it's just morning sickness.
Yah?
Yah...
Uh-huh.
Yah, I think that vehicle there probly had dealer plates. DLR?
Yah. Say, Lou, ya hear the one about the guy who couldn't afford personalized plates, so he went and changed his name to J2L 4685?
No motels registered any tan Ciera last night. But the night before, two men checked into the Blue Ox registering a Ciera and leavin' the tag space blank.
Gotta go?
Well, how the heck are ya?
Yah, ya know it's the Radisson, so it's pretty good.
No, just so I can see ya, ya know. Don't have to turn my neck.
I'm sorry.
It's okay, Mike...
Well, you do reside their at 1425 Fremont Terrace?
Anyone else residing there?
Well, Mr. Proudfoot, this call came in past three in the morning.  It's just hard for me to believe you can't remember anyone calling.
Well, I'm sorry I won't see ya.
What'd he say?
No. No. No. They weren't - he, uh, he was bothering Linda for about, oh, for a good year.  Really pestering her, wouldn't leave her alone.
No. No. They never married.  Mike's had psychiatric problems.
Yah.
Yah, it's over the wire, it's everywhere, they'll find 'em.
My car! My car! Tan Ciera!
They're real good.
Yah, not too bad. So it's nice up there?
Three-cent stamp.
It's terrific!
Oh, for Pete's - a course they do! Every time they raise the darned postage, people need the little stamps!
I'm sorry, I haven't the faintest idea what you're talking about.
We're still men.
Bob, Bob... I'm a member.
Here are your flight coupons.  Call me from the road if there are any snags.  Your itinerary...
You don't get paid to abuse the copy machine.
Okay.  Where to begin?  With your constant absenteeism?  With your unpresentable appearance?  You're up for review...
Yes?
You need healthy, natural sleep. Chew valerian root and get some more exercise.
What?
It's cheaper than a movie, and there's free coffee.
Really?
Candy-stripe a cancer ward.  It's not my problem.
I don't know -- am I?
Should we?
I suppose.
Like testicular cancer?
This isn't a for-real suicide thing. This is probably one of those cry-for- help things.
I got this dress at a thrift store for one dollar.
Please.
Tragically, they're dead.  I'm alive and I'm in poverty.  You want any?
Good.
Whatever.
Hear what?
Have we been talking too long?  Must we change the subject?
That day you came over to my place to play doctor... what was going on there?
... A person.
Marla, it's me.  Have we... have we ever had sex?
What is wrong with you?
Tyler Durden!  Tyler Durden, you fucking freak.  What's going on?  I'm coming over there...
Give me a minute, Marla, alright... just sixty seconds.
Then, I'll have the clam chowder... fried chicken and a baked potato with everything and a chocolate chiffon pie.
I know that I've been... unwell.  I know it's been like there's two sides to me.
I deserve that.  Anyway, I've... I've only just realized
No, no, shut up!  I've had enough. I tried, Tyler... I have tried...
... You know me?
Why?  So you can say, "Oh, that's what you do." -- And be a smug little shit about it?
How's that working out for you?
The "now I get to go out and buy the exact same stuff all over again" list.  That list.
A hotel?
Is it a problem for you to ask?
I want you to hit me as hard as you can.
In reel three, right after the courageous dog and the snooty cag -- who have celebrity voices -- eat out of a garbage can, there's the flash of Tyler's contribution...
He farted on meringue; he sneezed on braised endive; and, with creme of mushroom soup, well...
I don't want to die without any scars.  How much can you really know about yourself if you've never been in a fight?  Come on... you're the only person I've ever asked.
He was setting up franchises.  My father never went to college, so it was really important that I go.
After I graduated, I called him long distance and asked, "Now what?"  He said, "Get a job."  When I turned twenty-five, I called him and asked, "Now what?"  He said, "I don't know. Get married."
What car?
Soldier of Fortune.  Business Week. New Republic.
I'm fine.
Okay.
No, I'm not...
It isn't... ?
Fucking sweet.
I heard.  Local 15, Monday nights.
Hey.
I felt like destroying something beautiful.
Fight club was the beginning.  Now it's out of the basements and there's a name for it -- Project Mayhem.
Nothing.
Wait a minute...
What's this all about, Tyler?
What... ?
What are you talking about... ?
Night jobs -- while you were sleeping.
I'm going to...
Stop finishing...
Since when is Project Mayhem about murder?
What?
Defuse the bomb, please.
Yes.
It's out of our hands.  This is it.
Fifteen seconds now.  Can you see alright?  10... 9... 8....
Paraffin.
Proceed with remote detonation.
You need me.
Look, I can be selfish, I know that.  I'm not blind to my own failings...
I swear on my life, I won't...
What have you left for me?
What?
Maintenance.
Well, sir, you said you might.
We have a deal worked out with Irvine.
Pleeeeeease!
Yesssss...
Why?
Exact order?  Then I'm next!  I was meant to die with my friends, so I'm next!
I hope you're ready for this.
And when it was Rory's turn to die, and Thomas was in the way?
I don't think so.  Alex's premonitions happened exactly as he saw them no matter how much we tried to change it.
What about you, Kimberly?  Did you anyone from Flight-?
Blow me.  Yellow means go, Kimmy.
Of course not.  That would be irresponsible and unprofessional.
Evan Shaeffer's dead.  Guess he wasn't as lucky as we thought.
Maybe.  What's this about?
What was the fight about?
Does she have a cell phone?  A way we can contact her?
Eighteen.  And it's "Hebrew".
There's going to be a pile up.  Logs. Bodies everywhere.  I saw it happen. It happened.
Alright miss, calm down.  I just need this lane open.  I need you to pull your vehicle onto the shoulder!
The log truck...and everybody I guess. Everyone was driving like a maniac. And somehow I knew something horrible was going to happen, even before it did.
...My Premonition was just like his.
Then you believe all this??  That Death is working off a list?
Clean up?  I don't...
Who is this guy, anyway?
How are we going to find her?  There must be thousands of white vans in this state.
I think a nurse named Kalarjian is going to choke Isabella to death!
I know.  I can feel it too.
Yeah, don't make me cite you for harassment.
There's going to be a huge accident! Everyone's gonna die, all of us, I saw it!
Hey, don't be knockin' the Chevette.
Fix-A-flat?  Road flares? Sunblock?  Mace?
Jeez, Mom, stop trippin'.
Yeah?
Nice try, kiddo.
He's not a witch.
That's total bullshit. You can find death omens anywhere you want to.
No, but it might as well be the same thing. This was a message... from someone, or something... hinting... at the design.
No.. I mean, I don't have anything on me. This won't be safe.
I wish you were on the plane!
Look, there's something you should all know.
You get off havin' control over me. Let me choose how to deal with it.
"Next?"
No harm. No foul.
No one's that strong.
You have a responsibility to tell me.
May as well go out under my own free will, right?
WE DON'T NEED THIS NOW!
That's right, buddy.
Star Wars?
There's the Mekong.
This is state-of-the-art firepower.
AC-System 'Big-Ear' telescopic mike with built-in audio processor. Can pull a whisper out of a loud cocktail party at 50 meters.
That's a real good reason to wind up in 'Nam.
Who cares?  Let's just do it and get out.  Go have a Jacuzzi and get laid in Bangkok.  Know what I mean?
I need a vacation.
It's a Soviet MIL MI-24.  Probably has 12.7mm nose cannon, heat-seeking rockets and wire guided missiles, plus...
How much we got left in that minigun?
Oh.  They talk to me at university before fall of Saigon.  Make deal.
Huntington Beach, California.
Nguyen is good boy.
Yes.  But I lose many merits in next life.  Very bad.
How?
Why you don't feel love?  Not allowed?  Dead inside, maybe?  You make yourself dead already so they can't kill you?  In-vulnerabo?  Bullshit!
Let's get that tent down!
Sorry, Sir.
Not yet.
Couple hours.  Let me buy you a coffee.
I know.
Have fun.
Yeah.  Big time.
Five.  I never wanted that stuff.
I just wanted... I don't know... after all that... I just wanted one person, one person, to come up to me and say "you did good, John." And mean it.  That's all.  After all that.
Ah... I do them myself.  I used to work in a beauty parlor.
I can't believe you lived with her for that long. If I had to live with my mother, I'd stab myself six times.
I don't understand you. What is the problem?
The nails!! Watch the nails!!...  Listen, you still have to eat.
Yeah, well... suicidal paranoiacs say funny things sometimes.
You didn't kill anybody.  Stop.
I don't know her last name... I'll be off in a second.
...<u>Forget it</u>... <u>Goodbye</u>!
What does that mean?
Well, what the hell does that mean?
He just needs some clothes?
Well..everything's closed up. We thought we'd get some dinner.  Say!....Anybody up for Chinese?  Have you eaten? Would you like to come along?
"I'm an incredible woman?"  What is this, a death sentence?
All right... I'll pack my stuff tonight.
I think she likes me... she gave me her number, but she must work a lot cause when I call she's never home... But I think we'll go out this weekend... I've...
Well,... I'm a singer by trade... Summer stock...nightclub revues... that kind of thing...It used to be what I absolutely lived for...God...I can do GYPSY backwards - every part- but, one night...in the middle of singing "Funny..... - it suddenly hit me... ...what does all of this really mean?  That, and the fact that all my friends are dead...God, I sound like a veteran. Dad would be so proud.
Oh please!...I was born a Catholic in Brooklyn... I've been to hell and back.... I'll be fine...  ....Thanks...You're a gem.
Fine.
Yes well...  You are a credit card holder, are you not?
All of them... Which means <u>you</u> have just won a free membership at our store on Second Avenue.
Uh... you... you can pick out up to ten movies...
Yes.  They're free.
Tonight!  How's tonight?
Uhh... I'm drawing a blank.
I know!  You can't imagine how surprised I was.  Who would think you could find anything divine on the Upper East Side.
Well, if every time someone did something offensive they hit in the head with a pebble, I think they might alter their behavior. What do you think Jack...
Can I take you to lunch?
You're a true <u>friend</u>.
That's why the Little People sent you. Just <u>like</u> magic.
You're totally gone, aren't you?
Who?
It's a classic.
I'm sorry....I'm just so excited.  You must have felt this way when you first met Anne, huh? Where did you two meet?
Tch...how romantic. Yeah. If I wasn't already committed to Lydia, boy. Except Anne'd never go for me though. She loves you too much. And you really love her, huh?
No. Nothing bad's going to happen. Anne'll be there. I'll be there. Nothing bad will happen.
You won't be alone for long.
It sounds exciting.
Well, I'm in search of the Holy Grail.
Well... you're walking me home.  I... I guess you're sort of... attracted to me and you'll want to come upstairs for... coffee...
And then we'll exchange phone numbers and you'll leave and never call and I'll go to work and feel great for the first hour and then slowly turn into a piece of dirt by lunch.  Why am I putting myself through this?  It was very nice... uh meeting you. Good night..
Listen, I'm not feeling well.
It's ridiculous! I'm sitting here, listening to some asshole cracker compare his life to mine!
Right. Now show me a little somethin' this time, okay? Give me some form...
I'm not.
Yes.
I hope they do.
You go slippin' around in front a my face, an' in front a Elton an' Stoney. What do you imagine they think a someone you treat that way...
If you really want a get up an' leave me, you can read about it in the newsprint.
It brings out my eyes...
Okay...
Wait a sec. I want Tita to take a picture of you an' me in front of the place...
Where are you going?
Alaska? Are you on vacation?
But I can't have any. Is that what you mean?
Would you like to talk to the manager?
Now all you have to do is hold the chicken, bring me the toast, charge me for the sandwich, and you haven't broken any rules.
Well, I don't claim to have sold 'em all. They still have some left, I believe.
Well, I don't mean to.  Here's your tea, Tita.
Everybody still up on the Island?
Crashes into a Jeep and totals his neck.  That's Carl...
Don't tell me about this...
I'm going back up tonight. Will you go with me?
Uhm hmm. Some range.
No, I don't really think you're a freak.
What about Carl and Catherine? Is he just coaching her, or what?
Sailors are sadistic, I feel.
Playing piano all day and then jumping into cold water. You could get a cramp.
Well, I wouldn't want to get too invigorated myself.
I don't know. Let me give it some thought.
Then after that?
Tomorrow, then.
Of course I do. It's music. You know...
Well, at least you're accomplished at something...
At being a fake.
That's right.
Will you let me talk to you, please?
Just give me a chance, will you?
Yes.
Is she?
Thanks, Carl...
That's what I mean...
For two whole weeks, an' there wasn't hardly nobody there to talk to but me. The manager of the place told me it was the off season, an' it must a ben, because other'n me, there was just this 25-year-old kid, DeLyon, that didn't appear to be all there, an' this old married pair next to me that was always hollerin' for quiet. Can you imagine? All you could a heard there was a pin, an' them, hollerin' away...
Well, I was goin' to, but Bobby said he hadda kind of feel things up here first, which I can understand, but then it went an' took so long, I ran flat outa money...  I didn't have no number to call, you know.  So I hadda clear outa there an' come on up here, in the hopes that I wouldn't be intrudin' myself...
I wouldn't be a waitress. They're nasty and full of crap.
What do you mean "mass"... I have to come out and tell you, you're not that clean, either.
Well, she was.
Well, you have to simply tell me, that's all.
Look at me.
Just get the fuck outta here.
I'm wit' Carlos.
Victor.
Hi.
Nothin'.
I, umm, came to see you.
I guess he's outside someplace I don't like takin' him down to certain places.
Of course.
You know. I got a lot, more than one.
Just chill.
Nah, we make out and stuff.
I buy them flowers.
I kissed those girls.
I aint gotta prove nothin' to no girl, 'cause I got it like dat.
Eddie from Baruch, the one who was sittin' wit' dat little girl;
I got punished, man.
Yeah! Tell me which one you would like. To be doin' nothin on a fire escape or beat the pool with a bunch of girls? Be straight up!
Pitt.
If we were at 10th Street Pool you woulda done it right in the water, right?
Which one?
No, c'mon, stop playin'. The girl that you kissed when we got there. Where s he live at?
Yeah, he got a bad attitude.
Yeah.
Yeah.
She didn't say she had no man.
Positive.
Not really.
By the way: what kind of name is Poon?
You're kidding.
Whaddyamean 'maybe'?
What goddamn right do you have to take him?
I see. And what do you do for a living, Mr. Fletch?
It was planted on me, sir.
You idiot. Off the record, deep background: I've got that beach crawling with undercover cops.
Can I ask anybody now?
Not a prayer.
Put the gun down, Alan. I'll take care of them.
We play tennis at the club.
One. B-a-b-a-r.
Funny old bird.
Just relax....
Yeah, we check you into Mt. Hebron for a few days, run lots of tests, charge a bundle. You can pull your pants up now.
You don't know me.
Nothing. They're still there.
Have you got a make-shift plywood pillory? Heh Heh, just kidding.
I hate to conduct business on the lanai. Why don't we step inside.
The thing that really tipped it off for me was something your wife said to me while we were in bed together.
How similar in build you and I are. Then I figured it. You bump me off, throw me in the car, and burn me up.
Harry S. Truman?
You sure did.
No problem.
Fletch?
Fletch, I never sold nothing.
Yeah. Maybe.
Why not?
Are you on a scavenger hunt of some kind?
I think you've got the wrong gal, fella.
Will this proposition entail my dressing up as Tina Turner?
Charmed.
I've got fifty thousand dollars says you will.
I want it done Thursday evening, around eight PM. My wife will be off to the club for a committee meeting. It's the staff's night off.  These will be open.
Get me on the first shot, if you can.
Sure, all drifters do.
The gun, the money, the tickets, and the dying.
Sure.
Kareem's in the wash. I need a favor.
Yeah.
I'm sorry?
Cute thing.
Oh, we've got lots of pictures. Let me show you some.
No, thank you.
Preoccupied with what?
Hi.
Can I borrow your towel for a minute?
Just like Alan. It's freaky.
Depends on the question.
What is this?
Yeah. My name's not John Ultramalensky and I wasn't at your wedding.
That's what I want to know.
Act natural.
I decided I was going to tell my husband about you today.
I'm telling you he's not your husband at all.
Come here.
You shouldn't be here.
Great. I'll have a Bloody Mary and a steak sandwich.
In her cabana, sir.
Cabana one.
Yes, sir. Beluga. But it is eighty dollars the portion.
Lock's busted.
I work for the landlord. He told me to watch out for the place.
Mattress police. There are no tags on the mattress. I'm going to have to take you downtown. Please give me your weapon.
I'm her cousin.
No it's not okay. You have to have this in by tomorrow. Did you see the ad we ran Sunday?
Why not? Oh shit... really?
Go to transportation, get a ticket.
Not really?
Jim Swarthout?
Frieda's boss.
My secretary.
I'd appreciate an opportunity to discuss this with you.
Of course.
But I ain't got you...
Don't say it.  Orange juice?
Mr. Fairlane, I'm very rich.  The kind of rich that warps minds. Nothing offends me.  When I was eleven, I walked in on my father and the Shetland pony he had given me for my tenth birthday. Does that excite you?
Who's your decorator?
I need you to find my little sister. She goes by the name Zuzu...
I'm sorry, that's gotta be a pair of tube socks he has down there.
Thanks for the information. Appreciate it.
I'll buy you a new one.  I found her.
Have what?
Lots of things.  Her favorite yogurt.  The ten drummers she would take to a desert island...
Damn, Ford, you're the most cynical man in the industry and that's not easy.
Tell me about it. Name's Kyle Troy.  Can't we bring up the bass.
I never thought I'd be jealous of your handicap... Sorry to hear about Bobby Vomit.
Could somebody tell me what's going on?  <u>Like slo-owly</u>...
Cash or check, Jazz?  Don't do this to me.
I found a lot of Art Mooneys. None with a police record, though. Not even Synchronicity.  Have you checked out Johnny Pinzolo/Crunch's houseboat yet?
Spooky.  I'll process her.
You're a fucking gentleman.  What do you want from me?
No, as a matter of fact you didn't. What about the girl, Zuzu Petals, how does she fit in?  I mean, she is what this case is about.
Contacts.
What are you doing at the office? You wouldn't believe what I've gone through tonight... I'm calling from the Mega Beta Pogo Sorority.
But the funny thing is, take a look at these Swiss bank account numbers. We got Bobby, Johnny, Colleen... and Julian Grendel.
How much?
You gave it to the girls for one.
Give me your gum and grab the wheel.
No.  Who's Art Mooney?
Friends?  You didn't tell me that.
Stop.  We still got serious detective stuff to do, but we've been up all night so we should hit the sack for...
Sorry, it was dark, now come on.
As Clark Gable said to Ava Gardner in Mogambo:  'Fuck the purse, we're gonna die-e-e.'
Let go of the belt!  What are you doing?  You got mad at me for trying to save the other guy.
Who do you think you are, Ford? The tooth fairy.  Kill!  Kill!  Kill!
You wish.  Come on, let's get outta here.
Yeah, Ford.  I'm okay.
Twelve pack?
Did he just say what I think he said?
Jesus, how could you be so stupid?  Come on, we're going to a hospital.
What kind of sentimental bullshit is this?
Who's my real father, man?
Why do you hate me?  It's gotta be more than Me Private You, You Cop.
Yeah, and that lead singer, Jesus, that white Van McCoy wanna-be with the six-inch platform shoes. He looked...
I was about to say he looked like shit, but hey, sure, he looked like you.
You were the lead sing -- Lieutenant, I didn't think anyone could cheer me up tonight... Thanks.  Really.
That's okay.  I'm quitting the music detective business to become a cop killer.  Pay's the same, but it'll be much more fun.
You gotta be kidding!  This is unfuckingbelievable!  I have to start the evening crawling down Capital Records, I shoulda chose suicide then, but oh no, the night was young!  Next up, my guitar! The second most important thing I own and now it's toothpicks for the homeless on Hollywood Boulevard!  Then, then, after I burned up your brother, Jazz... I should say as a fucking footnote I've usually treated women like shit -- used corsages, the wet spot, you know giving out Domino's Pizza's phone number and saying it's mine... Tonight was different. I felt respect.  I felt love.  Then Jazz left me... and <u>now</u> I get to die!
Yeah, I did, you condescending fuck, but I miss Snoopy coming out at the end.  Isn't your enjoyment impaired?
Shock.
Fuck me...
I'll tell you when somebody pays me to give a shit and stuff.
I don't remember any Arbor Day cards from Mr. Rock 'n' Roll Detective.
It's my daughter, man.  I know I never told you about her, but God, I love that girl.  She calls herself Zuzu Petals and she's been swallowed up by the gorgeous hell that is L.A. A fucking groupie partying with the pros.  You have to get my baby back, she's my pride and --
What?
There's nothing around.  Nobody's holding.
Were you ever in Poughkeepsie?
You made three sales to your roaches back there.  We had to chase you through all this shit and you tell me you're clean?
Enchant.  Alain, j'ai rflchi  votre proposition et j'ai dcid d'accepter.
You must take me for an imbecile. Why do you think I asked you to meet me in Washington?  I haven't spent five minutes in New York City without the company of a gendarme.
Avec a tu pourras le supporter.
Pour moi?
Je n'ai jamais vu tant de srenit. Elle m'a demand de tes nouvelles et si nous tions heureux.
I'm going to put them on the cat.
Je crois qu'on fait une erreur de le prendre avec nous.
What happens to the schedule?
What difference does it make? We'll be out of the country Friday.
What's he do?
Where the hell is it?
Morning.  Sometime.
Bill, keep shootin' your mouth off and I'll knock you into the middle of next week.
He coulda been white.
Some other time Jimmy, I'm beat.
Policy man in Queens.
I'm wounded.  Oh, oh.
The other guy's a frog too.  Checked in at the Edison.  Had a hooker sent up.
Hiya, Jesus.
This is what the tough guys are wearin'.  You know I only steal from the best.  It's Bonwit Teller.
For garbage?
You remember Mary Finelli?
So what?
Baltimore?
Well, why not a little of the King?
It was under control, Bud.  Butchy's just getting tight in his old age.
I tucked him in at Gordo's.
I love you more.
No.  This isn't what you think.
Frank, this is insane...
Queens, New York.
Hello?
Uh huh...
Look pal, I'm just askin' how you...
Right...and I'm asking how you called the game.
What?
What if it's not...
Wait a sec...there was something on the news.  Something about this space anomaly.  I think they said it was connected to some storm in '69.
1998.
Too busy playin' ball, huh?
I'm trying to be, Dad.  I'm tyrin'.  It's good to hear your voice.  I missed you...so much.
I think I'm losing you.
It's okay.  I'm still here, Chief.
I lost you.
Fire.
It did, Pop.  It did.
Yeah.  I'm okay.  What about you?  I want to know.  About you.  And your mom.
She's not here.
Dad, we did something.  Something to make it worse.
Dad, I think I may be able to get you enough information to make sure the DA can nail this bastard.
Coupla days ago they dug up a body in Washington Heights - Mary Finelli.  Girl disappeared in '68.  Turns out she was his first kill.  Which means he probably knew her.  Most serials know their first victim.  I'm gonna do some checking - see if I can put any of this together...
You really wanna know?
H-hi.
Okay, okay...
Right, now I need you to tape it up on the outside, where he touched it, so the prints keep.
Just a minute, John...okay?  Don't go away.
Yeah, Dad.  What the hell is going on?
Sully!  Is that you?
Fire?  What are you talking about?  He had cancer, John.
Whoa, I just...I just...
That wasn't luck, Johnny boy.  That was smarts and ten plus on the job.
April 16...?  That means she was the first.
This case just got hot.  We pull on this string...
So you figure the murders stop 'cause he's off the street.  Then by the time he gets paroled, he's smartened up enough to control himself?
Just cause he didn't want to look at the photos doesn't mean he isn't the doer. Not everyone fits the profile.
So how are things at the hospital?
No kidd'n, he musta been pushing 90!
Yeah...I remember.  I used to play cops and robbers but y-- ...my mom wouldn't let me have a toy gun.
Yeah.  I just wish I'd told her how proud I was of her.
Actually, I have no idea what the World's Record is.  I was just kidding.
Maybe this wasn't such a good idea.
You can play with yourself, 'cause I'm going in the house.
First we take off our clothes, then you get on top of me or I get on top of you...
I love you, man!
I don't know.  I flunked Spanish.
Your bed.
Why?
What?
No.  I can look around by myself. I'll take the upstairs.
It's deceiving.
I'm trying.  I'm really trying.
You're Shelly?
Stick around and you'll see.
Everything's gonna be fine.
Yes.
Go out and plug the cord back in.
That's it.  We're driving this baby back to town... in reverse.
He sure chose the right day to pull this shit.
Now wait a second!  I thought Burt shot you.
Megan, my deputies have more important things to do than look for camp counselors with car trouble.
What's it to ya?
No.
It probably wouldn't have any effect on him.  The only sure way to stop Jason is to return him to his original resting place, where he drowned in 1957.
There was this monster.  He was after me.  He wanted to kill me.
No more.
Are you ready?  He's taken our young men off to teach them my favorites sport.
Yeah, we're here.
I don't know.  He called somebody, then took off.
Please don't do anything crazy.
Twenty.
Do you have to ask?
Okay.
She's your lady only cause she ain't had a taste of the Duke yet.
Sorry.
Next, you dial a number.
I'm now begging you.
Have a good night.
About what?
No -- she left me!  After her miscarriage, I --
She did have a miscarriage, didn't she?  Didn't she?!
She's a waitress at Joey B's but she needs some extra cash.  Ward's the pimp.
So what else is new?  Look Eva, you're asking the wrong dude to feel sorry for Tamara Mason. Wise up -- it's not hip to be her friend.
My parents are open minded about that sort of thing.
What? Don't be a lightweight...this is top dollar toot.
So there's no reason for him to come back because there won't be any of us around...right?
Rennie's not coming.
She's...she's dropping the anchors. I thought the Coast Guard could find us easier if...
I packed it. Just for us.
No, I think it's just the beginning.
That lunatic has been spouting off about Jason since we boarded...  It's no coincidence.
Just felt a little chill.
Whenever I get near the water, I see this young boy drowning. He tries to pull me down with him.
No. It was just a normal summer. I've never been able to figure it out.
Give me the degrees first, followed by minutes and sec...
We changed our minds.
If I go with you, he'll never speak to me again.  But I'm never going to live up to his expectations anyway...so maybe it's the right thing to do.
I'm not!!
Drugs...  Then Jason came. He's here, Sean.
Where you're going, mister?
You are going where?
Shut up, Elliot.
She wants a divorce.
Do not inhale.
Shit. They don't have any carrot soup.
Steven Schwimmer. I memorized every word of this review.
I don't have the problems that artists have.
`The most interesting thing about Elliot Litvak is that he writes the way he looks -- fuzzy, grubby and shifty-eyed.'  I'm telling you as a friend.
She was very evasive.
Did you see the winning run score?
This could be it.
Does what feel comfortable?
She's dying.
We don't even like each other, do we?
I don't drink coffee, Daddy. And this is not what we should be talking about.
Don't be so steely-eyed. It's that course you're taking in criminology.
Everything.
A flat-out hit.
Even if the truth about a person is sad or depressing or shocking?
How prominent?
That's very lovely actually.
I want to know. We haven't talked this way in years.
Nicky, no. This is insupportable. How could you?
It violates so many trusts.
This could be it!
Get yourself something to eat.
Since when did that matter?
I lost it. I lose everything.
Everybody else does. Why not you?
Hey, Toyota. He asked me a question.
It's complicated. It's a whole life. A person doesn't commit an act of violence out of nowhere. There are strong forces at work.
Wife and daughter. My father's still alive. He outlives me, starting tonight. Because the Mets just tied the score. It was only a matter of time, wasn't it?
It's a simple subject.
I want to believe.
Life is good.
Because God loves a winner.
No. They're not your team. They're my team.
When I traveled through Asia this summer, I went to tremendous trouble and expense to rent a car with a phone so I could call up Sports Phone in New York and get the scores. I drove through the war in Afghanistan calling Sports Phone like every hour on the hour, for updates.
How come?
That's the line I can't ever, for the life of me remember. I just can't get it.
I hear good things about the new play.
Is what true?
Steven goes to extremes to protect his privacy. No friends. No phone.
I know you both. Enough. How much knowledge does it take before a man does something crazy.
Our Steven not only disguises himself.
And I thought, at last, she's here, she wants me.
Are you sure?
Stop!
Jinnah has -- has cooperated with the British. It has given him power and the freedom to speak, and he has filled the Muslims with fears of what will happen to them in a country that is predominantly Hindu.  That I find hard to bear -- even in prison.
Let me hang on with two hands or I will fall.
Going nearer to God!
It does. We must be getting old, Charlie.
How does a reporter in Central America learn that Gandhi was born in Porbandar anyway?
Back in South Africa...  long time ago.
He said he's in charge...
I thought you were against fighting.
I think if we all worked to publicize it... all of the Congress... every avenue we know.
We must end the campaign.
I say when is now -- and we will determine how.
Hm. And what should an "important professional" write about your response to General Smuts's new legislation?
I don't know... I know you are right. I don't know that this is right.
I'll send my gardener. I'm sure you'll have much to discuss.
Somehow I expected not.
I congratulate them.
Who's leading them?
He's "discovering" India.
Come with me now, Vincent.  You've gone as far as you can go.
I will prove it to you.  Come swim with me now, Vincent.  Now--tonight.
Er, no...
This <i>is</i> the most likely location--
Something's not right.
Get it.  From outside, if you have to.
Luca could still be an accomplice.
This time I will supervise each test personally.
I will not permit any further testing on the eve of a mission.  We're already counting backwards.
I've been looking for him.  Do you know where he is?
You're both going to a lot of trouble--  Maybe you can con somebody into believing you're me to get your foot in the door--but once you're inside, you're on your own.  I'm sure you're sincere...  ...but I was being groomed for something like this myself.  Even without the accident I don't think I would have made it.  My point is--how the hell do <i>you</i> expect to pull this off?
Wrong color.  It's silver.  It's not easy living up to this.
You had to be a right-hander.
<i>More</i> than that.  You'll get used to it.
Leave?  Just a few million years ago every atom in this hair--in our bodies--was a part of a star. I don't see it as leaving.  I see it as going home.
He was still warm when they confirmed.
I'm proud of you, Vincent.
Any particular reason?
What are you talking about?
They found my eyelash.
Where is your head, Jerome?  You're acting like a guilty man.  They won't marry the eyelash to you.  They won't believe that one of their elite navigators could have suckered them for the last five years.
I'm sorry.  I think I was crying.
You're the one who said not to change anything. She's my ear to the investigation.
Of course not.  But she's have to know eventually.
I got the better end of the deal.  I just lent you my body--you lent me your dream.
We would like Vincent to have a brother... you know, to play with.
--We didn't want--<i>diseases</i>, yes.
Antonio, the choir...
I think I could do something  provided you know what you're doing and you can meet the terms.
I hope he's not just a body.
You celebrate, Jerome?
What exactly is wrong?
We could go together one day.
Only every time I'm in here.
I'll tell you at the end of the week.
New policy.
Not at all, just a pleasant way to have lunch.
They're mine. The one with the moustache is my brother. They stay out of it. We stay clean.
They will be ready. You guys do your job.
Beynon.
What about her?  Let's c ut up the money, I want to get North.
So we did that crackerbox... to cover for you.
I bet.
Small town, small bank, big money.
Better than old times.
That Beynon's got a long arm.
After four years and now the question comes up.
It's all right.
Sure.
Better than I remembered.
Suit yourself.
Is he straight?
But sometimes I cried a lot too.
Want to cry now?
That bad?
At least you were outside.
There are three men dead.
I've never "been there... When we met it was in his office.
There wasn't any way to explain it.
You sent me to him.
And switched keys.
You bastard...
I wouldn't worry Doc. I can always get you out... I'll screw every prison official in Texas if I have to.
You'd do the same for me, wouldn't you, Doc?  If I was caught, wouldn't you?
I mean it.
If I hadn't killed Beynon., you would have.
El Paso.
Not now.
It's all a game, don't bother me.
I don't want to hear it.
We've come a lot of miles. But we're not close to anything.
Either we pick it up or else we leave it right here. We got to go one way or another.
Oh, Jesus... how?
Hell, I don't know... but we sure gave it a run.
Me, too. Got twenty-four days of furlough and I'm goin' home.
Me, neither. There's about twelve people in the state that aren't Mormons and I'm one of them.
Sure can. I'd like an Invicta 12-gauge pump with the twenty-inch barrel.
Two boxes of double-ought buck.
Might try that.
I'm good at that.
You serious?
Don't worry about me, I'll grab a cab... I can afford it, you know.
That's not possible. We can't leave here... we've got all this.
Yes, you do, Albert. Talk or I'll kill you.
Last Sunday afternoon, Eric and two of his boys arrive with Frank and tell me that he's rumbled. Somehow, he's seen the film and was about to shoot his mouth off. They ask me for some whisky and start forcing it down his throat.  I thought they'd just duff him up a bit. Honest.
I know.
Yes.
What name?
I had to. It was the only way I could get at them.
I can't Jack. How can I?
Fine...  I want to talk to you.
Yes.
Once a week?
What?
Who?
While he was here. You went about together?
Of course. Where else?
Oh, he was. He told me a magic spell that would make you come.
We're there now.
You've been watching the film.
What girl?
I don't know.
Yeah.
No.
No. It's all right.
Frank was a good bloke. It's the least I could have done.
Working at Woolworths.
Yes.
At me friend's house.
Wilton Estate.
Thanks.
Went to school with him.  He was leader of our gang. He'll know what's going on in this town.
Where you off to?
Who's Brumby?
I'm sorry. Here. This'll pay for a course in karate.
I see.
You sure?
I'll bet this one's seen some action.
Funny.  Can I phone London?
Don't ask me.
What about Keith?
I'm going to sit in the car and whistle 'Rule, Britannia'.
It would be. If they were still living.
What are you doing? Advertising Martini?
You should have told me who you were working for.
Sit down, Jack,  I could weep. I really could. Sometimes I think I'll retire. Just piss off to the Bahamas and let somebody else employ them,  Glenda, get Jack a drink. What is it, Jack?
Piss off, Ray.
Yes.
Yeah, I'll do that.  Told you it wouldn't take long, didn't I?
They do that up North.
You're bluffing, you bastard!
Calling my bluff, are you, Harry?
Where am I going to work?
To get on the...
Mmm...
I...I don't know.
Eh?
...cower in his boots...
...sales promotion, "You lose, then we fire your..." No.  It's medieval... it's wrong. "Or we're going to fire your ass." It's wrong.
You know who it is.  It's Mitch. And Murray.  'Cause it doesn't have to be this way.
What?
That's the truth...
What could we get for them?  I don't know.  Buck a throw...buck-a- half a throw...I don't know...Hey, who knows what they're worth, what do they pay for them?  All told...must be, I'd... three bucks a throw...I don't know.
We're just speaking about it.  As an idea.
That's right.
Have I said that?
Did you talk to Graff?
What will he pay?
You have to steal the leads tonight?
What does that mean?
That's right.
You went for it.
Why?  Why you going to give me five grand?
What do you care...?
That's...
...what am I going to do all month...
Where was I?
Do you understand?  My stuff is mine, his stuff is ours.  I'm taking half of his commissions-- now, you work it out.
Thank you, George.
In school.
Just go to lunch.
Excuse me...
...did they...
How the fuck do I know?  What...talk to me.
Yes, I have a problem.  Yes, I do, my fr...It's not me that ripped the joint off, I'm doing business. I'll be with you in a while.  You got it...?  Where are you going?
I'm talking with Mr. Lingk.  If you please, I'll be back in.  I'll be back in a while...I told you, check with Mr. Williamson.
Could I...
Shelly, you blew the last...
...then what is this "you say" shit, what is that?  What is that...?
Roma.
Not lately it isn't.
I have.  And my job is to marshal those leads...
You're saying that I'm fucked.
Let me tell you something, Shelly. I do what I'm hired to do. I'm...wait a second.  I'm hired to watch the leads.  I'm given...hold on, I'm given a policy.  My job is to do that.  What I'm told.  That's it.  You, wait a second, anybody falls below a certain mark I'm not permitted to give them the premium leads.
Either way.  You're out.
...they kicked out.
The leads are assigned randomly...
And what if you don't close.
And fifty bucks a lead.
You fucking asshole.  I haven't got it.  I haven't got it, John.  I'll pay you tomorrow.  I'm coming in here with the sales, I'll pay you tomorrow.  I haven't got it, when I pay, the gas...I get back the hotel, I'll bring it in tomorrow.
I'm asking you.  As a favor to me?  John.  John: my daughter...
Because I say so.
The deal still stands, our other thing.
Somebody broke in.
I talked to Murray and Mitch an hour ago.  They're coming in, you understand they're a bit upset over this morning's...
What Roma's trying to tell you. What I told you yesterday.  Why you don't belong in this business.
...excuse me, nothing, you be as cold as you want, but you just fucked a good man out of six thousand dollars and his goddamn bonus 'cause you didn't know the shot, if you can do that and you aren't man enough that it gets you, then I don't know what, if you can't take some thing from that...  you're scum, you're fucking white- bread.  You be as cold as you want. A child would know it, he's right.  You're going to make something up, be sure it will help or keep your mouth closed.
What?
What are you talking about?
I don't know what you are saying.
How much did you get for them?  How much did you get for them?
"Bruce, Harriet...Fuck me, believe in yourself..."
"...You look around, you say, 'This one has so-and-so, and I have nothing..."
"'Why?  Why don't I get the opportunities...?"
Shut the fuck up.  Ricky.  You have a mean streak in you...  And what the fuck are you babbling about...? 
...Shut up.  Decide who should be dealt with how?  Is that the thing? I come into the fuckin' office today, I get humiliated by some jagoff cop.  I get accused of...I get this shit thrown in my face by you, you geniune shit, because you're top name on the board...
They took the phones...
"What we have to do is admit to ourself that we see that opportunity...and take it.  And that's it." And we sit there.  I got the pen out...
That's what I'm saying.  The old ways.  The old ways...convert the motherfucker...sell him...sell him... make him sign the check.  The...Bruce, Harriet...the kitchen, blah: they got their money in government bonds...I say fuck it, we're going to go the whole route. I plat it out eight units.  Eighty- two grand.  I tell them. "This is now.  This is that thing that you've been dreaming of, you're going to find that suitcase on the train, the guy comes in the door, the bag that's full of money.  This is it, Harriett..."
...and you don't remember. 'Cause you weren't around.  That's cold calling.  Walk up to the door.  I don't even know their name.  I'm selling something they don't even want.  You talk about soft sell... before we had a name for it...before we called it anything, we did it.
The hell with him.  We'll go to lunch, the leads won't be up for...
Yes.
Well, we'll do that this weekend.
Oh!  For the magazine...
Well, it isn't coming out until the February iss...sure.  Sure, go ahead, Ricky.
Kenilworth.
Mm.
Okay, okay, I'll be at the resta...
What do I...?
Mmmm...
Lingk.  James Lingk.
I don't know, the attorney gen... the...some consumer office, um...
But I'm not counting it.  Wednesday.  Thursday.  Friday.  So it would have elapsed.
If we wait till Mon...
I told you.
Tell me again.  Your wife.
She told me I have to.
I...
I don't have the power.  I said it.
The power to negotiate.
And the check is...
It's nothing.
Not to my knowledge, no...
Fuckin' cop's got no right talk to me that way.  I didn't rob the place...
Guess who?
Did they...
Oh.  Oh.  Oh, your "nostalgia" file, they's fine.  No.  Swell. 'Cause I don't have to...
Three.
No, where is it?
That's right.
The Corleone Family, Senator.  We called it, &quot;The Family.&quot;
We have no money for a rug.
Oh yes, the very best.
 You know his friends...real animals. And his connections with the police. Sure he'd like us to tell him our plans so he can set us up for the cops and earn their gratitude. Then they would owe him a favor; that's how he operates.  We'll have to pay.  Three hundred, are we agreed?
I saw him with you.
It was my father's money; and I'm entitled to what I need.  Where is Tom Hagen?
I just had a drive; besides, I want to see my brother-in-law Michael.
Dancing is alright; you're falling on the floor.
Not for strangers; for my country.
I'm not afraid of his words.
He will grow strong.
He will be a man, and then he will come for revenge.
I'm a little short.  I've been out of work.  Let me owe you the money for a few weeks.
What do you want me to do?
What is it?  Can I help?
What about now, is there anything you can help me out with?
I've always taken care of you.
There's nothing more you can tell me about this investigation?
Because he knows them; he knows they have no one to protect them. Vitone?  What do you think of my angel?
I know.  That's why I brought you with me!
 And he agreed?
Kay... Kay...
You don't know that's true.  But Kay, just for the sake of an argument, let's assume it is, I'm not saying it is, remember, but... What if I gave you what might be some justification for what he did... or rather some possible justification for what he possibly did.
With Mama, putting the baby to sleep.  Francesca's very happy. Michael was kind to her.  She idolizes him.  The children are all out in the speedboat.  I'm going to my house.
We don't know that's true, he never said that.
I don't know.
Mike wants it.
Tom, what do I do now?
Thanks, Tom.  Thanks.
You know there's a Senate Investigating Committee recently set up; we thought it would be unfortunate if they were to trace anything though-provoking to your name.
Our mistake.  But what does it matter; it was our money.  We don't even expect thanks.
Yes, sir.  His name is Vincenzo Pentangeli.
He is, I believe, a brother.
This meeting is adjourned.
This is my boy, and my wife.  Mr. John Ola of Miami.
Yes, Michael, it does.
It made me think of what you told me once.  In five years, the Corleone family will be completely legitimate.  That was seven years ago.
And that's all he had to do.  Just show his face.
Michael.
Oh, I do feel things for you, Michael; but now, I think it's pity. For the first time since I've known you, you seem so helpless.  You held me a prisoner once; will you try again?
At this moment, I feel no love for you at all.  I never thought that could happen, but it has.
You don't come in here, talk to an owner in Las Vegas like that.
You talk about the baby.  She can have another baby.
The Rosato Brothers have performed services for you in the past; I understand that they are under your protection.
Pentangeli is a dead man; do you object?
It means... &quot;The Lie.&quot;
Still no word of your courier? We'll find him.  But at least this will satisfy our friends here. You've been invited to the New Year reception at the Presidential Home. I understand your brother is here as well; I hope he'll come.
Very impressive.
How is his health?
I deny his every charge.
When do we talk?
You were unfair with them.
They feel cheated.
Your family still carries the name Corleone, and you will run it like a Corleone!
I was just going to contact you, Michael; we just had a 'sit-down' - in fact, I just come from there.
Always... But sometimes I don't understand.  I know I'll never have your kind of brains, in big deals. But Mike, this is a street thing. And Hyman Roth in Miami is behind the Rosato Brothers.
I thought we would meet alone.
I'm going to squeeze you, Corleone, because I don't like you; I don't like the kind of man you are.  I despise your masquerade, and the dishonest way you pose yourself and your fucking family.
All right, then let me say you'll pay me because it's in your interests to pay me.
We worked it all out beforehand.
We want Brooklyn one hundred percent.  No more taxes to you.  We want to be only loosely connected with your family -- sort of a under-family all of our own.  Then we can act on all internal matters without talking.  Also we want you to inform Michael Corleone that we can deal directly with him.
We got friends in the commission.
What about Michael Corleone?
Weird.
It never crossed your mind?
I didn't mean to...
You liked it too.
If you enjoy it, you should do it.
Is that all this conversation means to you?  Am I going to put out or not?
I'm keeping away.  What you are doing is no business of mine.
Tea is fine.
Your wife?
This is what the priests tell me. His sins of the flesh will keep him from heaven.
You're telling me Mr. Whale is a homo.
I put him to bed.  He's not there?
We have his note.
Just that I was in the Marines.
They were familiar when I painted them.  That one's copied from a Dutch still life done almost three hundred years ago.  And that's a Rembrandt.
I made only the first two.  The others were done by hacks.
What did she mean by going flooey?
You mean, like posed for pictures?
Just a year.  I dropped out to join the Marines.
I don't mind.  I'm not crazy about my old man either.
Of course.  I had to make it interesting for myself, you see.  A comedy about death.  The trick is not to ruin it for anyone who isn't in on the joke.  But the Monster never receives any of my gibes.  He is noble.  Noble and misunderstood.
Sorry.  I don't feel like sitting still today.
In a way, yes.  I suppose so.  I know it's why I stopped making pictures.
What happened?
You've done a helluva lot more than most people.
I told you.  I don't like to talk about that.
There's no people like you in my crowd.
You're talking through your hat now.
Something happened to him?
I didn't --
I'm game.  Sure.
Why not?  Give us something to do while we wait.
But you said --
I see.
That's where you're wrong, Clayton. You've just told one.  A very good story indeed.
I don't remember that one.
Oh, but it does.  Especially in light of the journey I'm about to make.
What did you expect?  Bronze?
Please, Clayton.  Just for a minute.  Long enough for me to see the effect.
What was that?
Relax, Clayton.  I can't hear you. I can't hear a word.
Fuck off!
Have a drink?
If you don't believe me, let's watch this movie.  See if his name's on it.  How about it, Harry? Can I watch my damn movie?
I just want to watch it, okay?
I wanted to be alert for your visit today.  Especially since I saw so little of you in the hospital.
"The fault, dear David, is not in ourselves but in our stars."
Oh, David, stop being a nanny.
Nonsense, my dear.  You look extraordinary.  Today's script.  Quick.  And a pencil.
My mind's lovely.  And yours?
Just go.  We can manage without you.
Don't be silly, Hanna.  He's a very proper actor.  And the dullest fellow imaginable.
No, Hanna.  My heart isn't that black.
She is beautiful.
I'll be fine, Hanna.  Thank you.
It must be up in your old room.  I will look.
No.  I expect you can't.
Is it now?  Hanna?  I think we'll take our tea down by the swimming pool.
But it's the horror movies you'll be remembered for.
Quite.
You must understand how Hollywood was twenty years ago.  Nobody cared a tinker's cuss who slept with whom, so long as you kept it out of the papers.  Outside of Hollywood, who knows who George Cukor is, much less what he does with those boys from the malt shops along Santa Monica?
Certainly, Mr. Kay.  Is there anything in particular you want to know?
Of course.
He's one of the great images of the twentieth century.  As important as the Mona Lisa.
Is there someplace we can talk?
Six years ...
Maybe she don't know. Although I don't see how that could be. Maybe she didn't want to upset you -
I do ...  Christ, what happened to us ?
Yeah Tell him to lay off Kip and them Tell him it's on
Yes ... Kip ...
I knew you'd say that.
I hope you know what you're doing. God help you if you don't ...
This is number 50. We did it. It's over Where's the money ?
Let them go --
You don't have anything on me. A misdee auto-theft. I got no record. I'll be out in three days, and back at it. Or you let them go, and I give you my word. I'm gone. And without the ringleader ... Your tee-times have just grown exponentially...
A little family emergency --
Needs brightening ...
Double-meaning intended, right?
C'mon, man ...
Lazy ... Lazy ... I ask you, Freb: what's the matter with kids today?
Hell, yeah. Mirror Man here is our electronics expert. He's got some gadgets you old farts maybe never -heard of; Tumbler can drive anything with wheels, and some things without; Toby's a hacker, can do things with a computer, that are pretty amazing ...
Peugot convertible ...
Okay, okay. The important thing to remember, is to Think Slow. Take your time. It may not seem like it, but the night is long. Long enough. Just think slow and think smart...
There's no one left ...
Pop the trunk. I need my tool ...
You, too, Ma...
No.
I couldn't. I didn't want you to worry. I thought held sort himself out. I hardly see him. He comes and goes. He's in trouble, isn't he?
Of course ...
Kipling was sixteen when you left, baby. I don't know what you remember of him. But you should brace yourself
Mother -- !
We do it. He'll get clear Once and for all
You've been pre-booked...
It's ear-marked for Mirror Man and The Sphinx...
Yeah... You want a ride...
How'd you get here? Your Moms give you ride -- ?
I dunno ...
Totally. I'm fine. You want a beer, man -- ?
Something like that -
Yeah --
Yeah, yeah. That's what I'm thinking --
About what?
C'mon, man... My "demise..."  Overreaction
Price of doing business...
I know. I've missed you, too
Sure, man --
What for -- ?
On account of me.
No can do. Life goes on, pointfive ... You left me, remember?
Six or seven...
I understand -
If you change your mind. We're at Otto's. It's 50 ladies in 24 hours. For The Carpenter. 200 K and Kip's life on the felt. So long now ...
Yeah, well ... She lives with District Court Judge Seymour Croft ...
I always thought you'd follow me up.
A little trick I picked up at the Car Thief Retirement Home ...
You're going high-cheese, dude --
How is he -- ?
Kip's not clear yet. We got one more to go --
The chop-shop... Where are the stripped cars?  The rolled-back odometers? The part bins?
His criminal career has officially come to a close ...
Robin was Robin Masters. He owned the estate they lived on ...
I'll see you soon --
You sure I can't go with ya?
Excuse me --
Billy, how are you?
Me? Why would I get into that shit?
Nods.
Nods again.
I've been all fucked up since I got out.
It was easy money. I did it in the can.  Shit! I learned the junk business in the can, Paulie.
But, Paulie, I'm sorry. Believe me.  I was fucking crazy.  But I'm okay now. I can be trusted.  I'm clean now. On my children. Believe me! Two weeks cold turkey waiting for bail got my head together...
You treated me like shit.
Liar!
Are you nuts?  Jeannie's husband went to the can just to get away from her, she's such a pain in the ass. Let me tell you. Nobody goes to jail unless they want to, unless they make themselves get caught. They do stuff with the wrong people. They don't have things organized. You know who goes to jail? Nigger stickup men. That's who. And they only get caught because they fall asleep in the getaway car.
How much?
I'm just having my last few drinks.
What are you talking about?
Let her carry this shit inside.
It'll be okay.
I'm afraid. I'm afraid if Paulie finds out.
But you've got to see your parole officer in the afternoon and  I promised we'd take Judy to F.A.O. Schwarz.
Just get me out.
You know. The stuff I left.
I got seared.
Bring the car round back. I know a place Upstate they'll never find him.
Jimmy was one of the most feared gays in the city.  He was first locked up at eleven and was doing hits for mob bosses when he was sixteen. Hits never bothered him. It was business. But what he really loved to do was steal.  I mean, he actually enjoyed it.  Jimmy was the kind of guy who rooted for the bad guys in the movies.  He was one of the city's biggest hijackers. Clothes. Razor blades. Booze. Cigarettes. Shrimp and lobsters. Shrimp and lobsters were the best. They went fast.
It's been six months.
I gotta talk to you.
Jimmy and I could never be made, because we bad Irish blood. It didn't even matter that my mother was Sicilian. To become a member of a crew, you've got to be one hundred percent Italian So that they can trace all your relatives back to the old country.
My father got a letter from the school. He said the next time he'll kill me.
I don't care. I need my hat.  I won't go without it.
Keep him here. I'm going for a bag.
Will you get the fuck out of here.
No. It's okay. Just watch this. Watch it.
Nothing. I dropped the soap. That's all.
He's okay. They sobered him up.
He's with his friends.
Ma!  Please! You're driving me crazy.
Paulie, I swear, I'm afraid. The guy's nuts. What do I have to do? Whatever I gotta do, I'll do.
What? Come on!
Oh shit.
Fuck you, you fat fuck.
Stop crowdin the plate!
No one. I didn't have the number.
Why not?
What do I look like, Al Cowlins?  You want to take my car, drop her off?
Week after I'm twenty-one.
Chuckie, what are you talkin'...
Little Morgan's got a lot a scrap, dude. I'd rather fight a big kid, they never fight, everyone's scared of 'em. You know how many people try to whip Morgan's ass every week? Fuckin' kid won't back down.
Yeah, I figured now that you got your big job over in Cambridge, you needed some way to get over there and I knew I wasn't gonna drive you every day...
How you doin'?
What? No. This is my mother's house. I don't live with my mother. I just stop by, help out. I'm good like that.
She'll live.  If she starts yelling again I might have to run in real quick and beat her with the stick again but...
Well, I don't have no trousers on...
--and he's like "shit! Motherfucker!" And he looks in his rearview and sees this cat-- I'm sorry--
You could put a pool in that backyard.
All right Morgan, fine. I'll tell you why we're not going to "Kelly's." It's because the take-out bitch is a fuckin' idiot. I'm sorry you like her but she's dumb as a post and she has never got our order right, never once.
I told you, I just got change.
Shut up.
What the fuck? I just asked you for a job yesterday!
I'm Irish.
History.
Well, you'd be working on the cutting edge. You'd be exposed to the kind of technology you couldn't see anywhere else because we've classified it. Super string theory, Chaos Math, Advanced algorithms--
Well, he didn't show up for work today...
What're you doing?
Half-red, half-black--
Oh, come on! You're not pinnin' this one on me. He left, I wanted to talk to him for another twenty minutes. I was havin' fun.
I'll cancel every meeting right now. I'll give you a job myself. I just wanted you to see what was out there.
So am I.  Yes. That's right, Will. Most days I wish I never met you. Because then I could sleep at night. I wouldn't have to walk around with the knowledge that someone like you was out there. And I wouldn't have to watch you throw it all away.
Yes.
No. LAMBEAU Okay thank you, Timmy.
I did.
Five.
Just meet with the boy once a week.
That would be fine.
No, he just sat there and counted the seconds until the session was over. It was pretty impressive, actually.
To show me he doesn't have to talk to me if he doesn't want to.
I live right around the corner.
Cutting edge mathematics. Think tanks. The kind of place where a mind like Will's is given free reign.
Sean, I really don't think you understand--
I do.
Look, I don't know what else I can say. I'm not sitting at home every night, twisting my mustache and hatching a plan to ruin the boy's life. But it's important to start early. I was doing advanced mathematics at eighteen and it still took me twenty-three years to do something worthy of a Field's medal.
--Personal rivalry? I'm not getting back at you.
Hold on!
He is at a fragile point. He's got problems--
--I don't want your trophy and I don't give a shit about it! 'Cause I knew you when!! You and Jack and Tom Sanders. I knew you when you were homesick and pimply-faced and didn't know what side of the bed to piss on!
Yeah. Summer vacation. Thought I'd travel some. Maybe write a little bit.
Never been.
You're pretty quick with those numbers. How about the odds of me buying the first round?
Yeah, Morgan. I got fired.
Hold up.
Yeah, Morgan. It's a real rarity that we'd be out drinkin'.
Like what, Will?
If you wanna hit "Ramrod," take your shot. Take some pride in it. You go to church? So fuckin' what, God loves you. I mean, Christ. A guy as well known as you? By the time you put your disguise on and skulk out of the house Sunday nights you probably look like "Inspector Cluseau."
You're getting defensive...Henry. And hey, cheif--tell the wife, at least. Christ, set her free.
285.
The color here, see how dark it is? It's interesting.
Haven't called her.
Yeah.
October 21, 1975. Game six of the World Series. Biggest game in Red Sox history, Me and my friends slept out on the sidewalk all night to get tickets. We were sitting in a bar waiting for the game to start and in walks this girl. What a game that was. Tie game in the bottom of the tenth inning, in steps Carlton Fisk, hit a long fly ball down the left field line. Thirty-five thousand fans on their feet, screamin' at the ball to stay fair. Fisk is runnin' up the baseline, wavin' at the ball like a madman. It hits the foul pole, home run. Thirty-five thousand people went crazy. And I wasn't one of them.
"I gotta go see about a girl"? What did they say?
Yeah.
Not to me, they're not.
I didn't ask for this.
I used to go with the wrench.
It's not your fault.
You're Welcome, Will.
I'm gonna travel a little bit, so I don't know where I'll be.
I didn't mean you. Listen, maybe...
See, it's my life story. Five more minutes and I would have got to hear your best pick-up line.
It's Will, the really funny good looking guy you met at the bar?
You aren't, by any chance, Pre-law? Are you?
Yes you were.
You wouldn't believe me if I told you.
Do you know all their names?
Well...
We'll do that.
How the hell did you do that?
I'd say...  It's only four in the mornin', they're prob'ly up.
Fine.
Some, a little.
Come one Will. I just want to know.
I see "Hot Cross Buns," but okay.
No.
What?
What am I scared of?
At least you have a mother.
What, you want to come in here and save me? Is that what you want to do? Do I have a sign that says "save me" on my back?
Be glad to get my han' on some cotton. That's the kin' a pickin' I understan'.
How 'bout you?
We're goin' to California, ain't we? Awright then, let's *go* to California.
I never had my house pushed over before. I never had my fambly stuck out on the road. I never had to lose... ever'thing I had in life.
I'll get Rosasharn.
Whatsa matter, Ma? Gettin' scared?
Well, we ain't out a it yet.
What'd he look like again?
Two an' a half! Say, mister, a man can't make his dinner on that.
But--but how we gonna eat?
Joad. Tom Joad.
Say, who runs this place?
Crate fell on me.
Have a little snort?
Ought to be. That's fact'ry liquor. Cost me a buck.
Didn't you hear? It was in the papers.
Shore it is. It always is, this time a year.
That's our place.
I never heard nothin' about it.
What you figger to do?
I don't know.
You're right!
Try an' tell 'em, Tom. They'll get two an' a half, jus' the minute we're gone. An' you know what that is? That's one ton a peaches picked an' carried for a dollar. That way you can't even buy food enough to keep you alive! Tell 'em to come out with us, Tom! Them peaches is *ripe*. Two days out an' they'll pay *all* of us five!
Want to work, do you?
Little trouble up ahead, but you'll get through. Just follow the line.
Just a few miles. I'd a walked her if my dogs wasn't pooped out.
Yeah.
Go ahead. Ask me anything you want.
It don't take no nerve to do somep'n when there ain't nothin' else you can do. 
'S all right, Grampa. You just kind a tar'd, that's all. Somebody fix a pallet.
No plants.
Now don't you go gettin' nimsy-mimsy.
No. No, it don't. I can't do that. I can't let m'self. All I can do is see how soon they gonna wanta eat again. They'd all get upset if I done anymore 'n that. They all depen' on me jus' thinkin' about that.  That's my part--that an' keepin' the fambly together.
An' you won't let nobody touch me?
Go get Tom an' Al.  I dunno what to do. I got to feed the fambly. What'm I gonna do with these here?
I know. Maybe that makes us tough. Rich fellas come up an' they die, an' their kids ain't no good, an' they die out. But we keep a-comin'. We're the people that live. Can't nobody wipe us out. Can't nobody lick us. We'll go on forever, Pa. We're the people. 
Maybe they got crimes in California we don't know about. Crimes we don't even know *is* crimes.
I was afraid they'd stop us an' wouldn't let us cross. But I tol' Granma. I tol' her when she was dyin'. I tol' her the fambly had ta get acrost. I tol' her we couldn't take no chances on bein' stopped.
On a gallon a gas?  Let's set up the tent. Maybe I can fix us up some stew.
You gotta keep clear, Tom. The fambly's breakin' up. You *got* to keep clear.
I kinda thought so. Felt like it.
They know what--this fella looks like?
Okay, Ma. I shouldn't, though. I know I shouldn't. But okay.
I could hide you, Tommy.
How'm I gonna know 'bout you? They might kill you an' I wouldn't know. They might hurt you. How'm I gonna know?
Good-by, Tom. Later--when it's blowed over--you'll come back? You'll try to fin' us?
Good-by, Tommy.
Could you see your way clear to sell us a loaf of bread, ma'am.
I know, ma'am... on'y it's for a ole lady, no teeth, gotta sof'n it with water so she can chew it, an' she's hongry.
I don't wanta rob you, ma'am.
Muley! Where's my folks, Muley?
But who done it?
They come. They come and pushed me off.
But it don't seem possible--kicked off like that!
Now don't go blaming me. It ain't *my* fault.
It ain't nobody. It's a company.
I wisht it was day.
Won't they ketch us?
I won't--  --if you won't tell what *I* done!
Well, I reckon you *stan'* in them little rooms--an' water come down outa that there little jigger up there--take a bath!
Mister, we're lookin' even under boards for work.
Awright. An' if she gets outa han', I'll be in the right han' corner, this side the dance floor.
I sell biscuits and gravy all over the Southland--
I sell BMW's. What do you do?
What?
He gets this way when he hits over eighty-five.
A Jew, a shaman, and a herbalist are telling you the same thing? You're insane.
Insane.
Yes.
I'm in California most of the time. Traveling a lot on business. That's about it, really.
You see someone?
Well, there's not much to tell.
Bad television.
That'd be good.
As long as I get the laugh.
--She's not dead---
Wow. I have to give this some thought.
I just know.
Effective. But to tell you the truth, I've lost my passion for work.
Sometimes I am. Sometimes. It's only natural.
Okay.
Up on the right.
Not me. So don't paw at me with your dirty little guild.
No harm no foul.
Hard to get good help these days.
Okay.
I guess.
Seventeen months ago I was posting a walk in Lisbon, and he was there. He never saw me. But I saw him, though.
We can't do our job unless he does his job.
Yup.
Wait. I have Mr. Grocer for you.
Would you describe their position as inflexible?
See you next week.
I'll do it tomorrow.
It's fine.
I've looked at it.
Yes. It's the same as usual. Nothing remarkable about it at all.
That's wonderful, Mom.
You don't have a headache. I have a headache.
I think I'll go see Debi today.
Paul?
Same thing that happened to you-- I stopped poutin' there on the sidelines. Got in. Got on the team. I joined the working week, you slick fucking asshole, so why don't you valet park your high horse and take it easy on your old buddy, Paul.
You too.
Work's good for the soul.
See you in ten years.
Well, a 'course, taxes provide your basic service-- police and whatnot. But our customers need a little more than just that, you understand? This badge doesn't mean that I am a peace officer.
Martin, I don't know where you've been since you abandoned my daughter ten years ago, and I don't care. It was good that you left, and I'm glad you did. So what do you want to talk about? You've grown up a bit. Maybe I had you figured wrong.
Oh, you know me, Martin. I'm the same old sell-out baby-boomer, exploiting the oppressed I got shot for at Kent State. But why don't we have a drink and forget the whole thing?
So what are you doing with your life now, son?
That's good.
Well, see, truth is, ma'am, I help horses with people's problems.
Plenty of signs -- just none of them printed. Who do I get the idea you're not just passing through!
Look! Please! Don't do the "shucks, ma'am" thing again!  I've driven a few thousand miles for a few minutes of your time. I've brought him here -- to your neck of the...  -- mountains. Just take a look at him. If you still feel the same way, I'll be on the road by morning and you'll never see me again. OK? Deal?
Don't be so sure it's my last. There are a few people back home I'd like to put under a red hot iron.
Well, maybe I am laughing a bit... I just thought, as long as you're here, it would be nice for you to relax into the place a little.
What's that to miss?
You sleeping all right in that house?
Why don't you ride anymore? Grace told me you used to ride when she was younger.
You too.
Need a lift?
You haven't heard the question yet. Truth is, you'd be doing me a favor. I got all these eager young colts need riding and poor old Rimrock here is feeling kind of left out...
College. In Illinois. She was playing the cello. I hadn't heard cello music growing up. She had the reddest hair, the bluest eyes. When she played, it was...
She was never really happy here. She did the best she could.
We did at one point. When we thought we'd have more children. And we after tried. We tried everything, but... wasn't meant to be.
Tom.
What?!
I won't ask you to.
Ssshhh...  Stand still, Annie. Takes what we've got, just for now. Can you do that?
Is that your version of a pep talk?
What about him?
I think we should. It's not fair to let him suffer. He's not much use anymore. He'd hate living like that.
Whatever you want.
I don't care.
You were never thirteen, Mom.
No, you just act like you do.
You already did.
You're right. Good.
Did you go riding?
About what?
Yeah. Does that mean I'm cured?!
NO, YOU STOP IT! Stop pretending like you care! Like this really isn't about you and Tom.
That's not true.
Because you are... one of the most... incredible, bravest, most beautiful woman I have ever met. The efforts you make. Your courage and your dignity.  I don't know where you got it? I honestly don't know how I would have handled all this if I were you.
Well... honey... you know... that's just not his way. Maybe you can write him a letter or something. Say thank you... Don't think about it... You take care and I'll see you home.
So do you.
All right. Speak to you then.
She was in pretty bad shape. They've done a C.A.T. Scan -- she has some hemorrhaging...
Tch. What are you --
Doing what?
Yeah.
No.
Robert, Grace isn't adjusting to school. And she can't sit in this apartment all day... I think it would be good for her.
I'm in charge. I went back very soon after the accident. They didn't expect me for a couple of months. I'll just take that time now... I can still oversee things from Montana... Take my fax... My computer...
Why?!
She will if you think she should.
Taking forever. I just got an additional list of sixty-two employees to interview before Monday. I don't know how I'm going to do it.
Okay.
I know. We miss you too.
Oh, Robert, I'm sorry. We were so tired from the branding. Grace barely made it to her bed and I didn't have the energy to take my clothes off.
You don't have to explain. You have every right to come.
Connecticut. I told the office I'd work out of there next week. When are you planning to start back?
Hi. Um, there doesn't seem to be any hotel room available and someone told me to come here and ask for "Tubab" who might to have a place for me to stay. Are you "Tubab"?
You want to take a walk with me?
No. He had the choice.
Would you mind if I did? I'd like to talk to him.
Oh, you can just set up on the dining table. I have to rearrange my shelves tomorrow.
I'd love to go there one time...
Well, I have more than a few days, ha, ha... I uh... I'm sort of... not an editor anymore... right now... First time I've said it out loud.
Oh, how sweet.
You!
Diane!
What, they ain't going forty miles into Choteau everytime they want a hamburger.
Weekend after next...
Be honest, I can't say I did it all myself. My grandma helped me get the words right.
I don't thinks you'd want me tripping all over you in front of everybody.
Uh, I'm Tom Booker. Your mother around?
There's no hurry. Take you time.
So?
You ever miss it?
Sometimes.
What do you mean?
Don't move!
Record the tones that the coins make. And hang up and get your money back!
Waste the dude.
See, we're very busy. A TV network that wishes to remain nameless has expressed an interest in our show.
What is it with this guy?
Check this out. It's a memo about how they're gonna deal with those oil spills that happened on the fourteenth.
Yo, man, you an amateur, man.
Look, you wanna be elite? You gotta do a righteous hack. None of this accidental shit.
Never send a boy to do a woman's job. With me, we can do it in seven.
Cereal.
Right. If I win, you wear a dress on our date.
Well, yeah, I just haven't found one as charming as you yet.
No. No one special.
Blow me.
I told you, I don't play well with others.
That's bullshit.
We did it!
Think you can do better?
I said give me time.
Yeah?
Crash Override. What was it. "Mess with the Best, Die Like the Rest?"
Are you challenging me?
This Ellingson security creep. I gave him a copy of the disc you gave me.
I'll hack the Gibson.
Yeah.
Norman? This is Mr. Eddie Vedder, from Accounting. I just had a power surge here at home that wiped out a file I was working on. Listen, I'm in big trouble, do you know anything about computers?
It's a little boxy thing, Norm, with switches on it... lets my computer talk to the one there...
Yo, chill man, I'm talking to Venezuela.
Sorry, I can't help you, okay?
No. He's either very smart or very stupid.
Run anti-virus. Give me a systems display!
One more "dude" out of you and I'm gonna slap the shit outa you, okay? Now I'm trying to save you from yourself but you gotta stop letting your mama dress you, man! : Check it...
You know, you're right about that.  Check it, Friday.
D'you bring those Crayola books?
Yeah! You better figure out what's on that disc, cause we're being framed. It's in that place where I put that thing that time?
Relax. Think about the 25 million dollars.
Basically, uhmm, yeah. Mmm hmmm.
I disguised myself as an Alabama State Trooper and penetrated the FBI NCIC.
Nothing, it's just a minor glitch.
Nonono, thank YOU!
555-4202.
Real charmer.
Okay sure. What about?
Don't get angry.
Not without Jamie.
Get up there Rachel!
Loomis, it's over. Leave it alone.
You'll have to watch Jamie tonight.
It's okay..it's okay.
Honey, this tie has a spot on it, I can't wear this today. I got a 10:30 with Chuck.
How do you know their not?
I can see this is useless.
How many bodies did you find?
Outside.
Sure ain't. Martians could land on Ben's doorstep, all he'd do is spit once and get himself a shot gun.
I can't sleep.
Like a sister?
But you wanted to go out tonight. It's my fault that you can't.
You bet.
I've got you come on, go down.
Then we'll be safe?
No.
All right.
You knew. You just didn't care.
I don't know.
Okay, bye.
No problem, Sheriff.
Yeah in the trunk of my squad.
What are we doing?
Oh, Sheriff Meeker, my name is Dr. ...
Michael Myers has escaped from Ridgemont. He's here in Haddonfield.
Yes.
They didn't know what they were fighting.
Let it be Earl. Let the police handle it.
Batteries. I planned the generator for the house next week. I wished I hadn't waited.  This is squawk 79er zero of Haddonfield broadcasting on the state police emergency frequency. Can anyone hear me?
Anything for a fellow pilgrim. Sometimes we need help getting where we want to be.  Reverend Jackson Pete Sayer of Dumon County, please to make your aquanauts.
Now you understand?
Hi, Dad. What happened?
You blame everything on kids.
All right. The Wallaces leave at seven.
Fun-ny. See you.
Look where?
Of course.
Bye.
I saw someone standing in Mr. Riddle's back yard.
I brought it for Tommy. I figured making a Jack-O-Lantern would keep him occupied.
What's this big, big news?
Here, Lester.
I know. Pull my legs. I'm stuck.
Okay. First I rip your clothes off...
...Then you rip my clothes off. Then we rip LYNDSEY'S clothes off. I think I've got it.
Just answer the damn phone.
Yeah.
I thought you were gonna get one for me.
Lee Brackett.
May be a few minutes. I gotta stick around here...
I'll be here.
You all right?
Nothing's going on. Just kids playing pranks, trick or treating, partying, getting high... I have the feeling you're way off on this...
As usual, I don't have anything to do.
Hi, Tommy.
Same time, same place.
Sure. Sure.
See you.
Why are they under there?
I'm so embarrassed. I couldn't face him...
There was no one outside.
What did he look like?
And I'm here tonight and I won't let him get to you.
I saw him...
Was it the bogyman?
Will you get her for me?
He said something else. "It's all right now. He's gone. The evil's gone."
Oh, listen...
Oh.
You want to see some?
A lot of works.
And then, uh, April...huh?
Right.
...a monstrosity!  Who would do that?
Yeah, I, we both live downtown.
Oh, uh, listen, David called me up.
No, he called late last night.
Yeah, we're the Stanislavski Catering Company.
What makes you think we're more interesting?
When did you first notice this?
The hospital?  What kind of tests?
Well, if it's nothing, then why do I have to go into the hospital at all?  I mean, uh, I hear perfectly fine, so I'm, so I'm a little weak on the, on the high decibels.  So I, you know, I won't go to the opera.
Look I-I-I'll be okay.  I'll be okay.
Now, look, you-you-you go on ahead.
'Cause I got a lot of wall space there. 
Could you--
Oh, Elliot!
What are you doing here?
Oh, I was just going to my AA meeting. ELLIOT Oh, my goodness.  Well, why do you still go to those?  You never tough alcohol.
Yes, it's-it's wonderful.
Well, sure.
Oh, that's nice.
Oh.
Oh, that's nice.  I'd love to see her wind up settled.  She's a tense one. 
Oh, right.
Not because of me, I hope.
Poor Hannah.
I can't say anything!
Yes!  But I...I have certain feelings for you, but don't make me say anything more, all right?
I didn't sleep all night.
No.
Oh, not here.  There are too many people around.
Uh...  I-I-I know.  I deserve this.
Yeah.  Uh, well, sure we did.  An- an-and in a way you led me on, because I truly believed you were unhappy with Hannah.  Otherwise, I would never have let myself be drawn in.  I was very weak.  So were you.  Now I've met someone else.
Aren't they great?
I know!  I know!
I don't know.
But, you got four children!
I-I-I know, but there's got to be some give and take.
Do you feel, um...are you disenchanted with our marriage?
What kind of interrogation... Su- supposing I said yes?  I-I-I am disenchanted.  I am in love with someone else.
It's hard to be around someone who gives so much and-and needs so little in return!
Get his wine away.
Yeah.
Always.
Yeah, I know.  But never to exist again!
Absolutely.
Mm-hm.
Yeah.
Based on what?  You never even see him.
They're in the basement.
I can't take this anymore.
Because I have to!
Well, maybe it'll only be temporary, but I ha--I have to try.
I'm saying it now!
Jesus...Jesus!
If there's nothing wrong with me  then why does he want me to come back for tests?!
Like what?!  What?
I--How was I to know?!  Everyone was pointing back here.
Can I tell you something?  Can I tell you a secret?
I can't stay on this show.  I gotta get some answers.  Otherwise  I'm telling you, I'm going to do something drastic.
Okay.
He was, he's just as crazy as ever. He was on his way to get a blood test. 
Really?
Huh?
I think he'll find that satisfying.
Yeah.
You know, where I-I-I would get implanted from a-a donor.
Right.  We felt that if we were gonna do it, that we would like somebody who we knew and who we liked and who was warm and bright and...
...from Mavis, also.
He's the one that's made every ingenue in stock!
No, no, we decided!
Someday, I'll pay it all back.
Will you just tell me one thing?
He's not a loser at all!
Oh!
Well, I think he was dying to open up.  It's so sad.  Now...what should I wear to my audition?
I mean, y-you know, don't say it that way, you know, because my confidence is not my strong point, I--
What?  You don't, don't be so sensitive.  Can't I say anything?
You know, I could always tell what you thought of me by the type of men you fixed me up with!
Look.  Listen.  Listen.  You want to write?  Write.
Can I, can I not accept gestures and feelings from people?  Do I, do I put people off?
I can't hear you.  I can't hear anything.  I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm gonna lose hearing in my ear!  I'm--
Not when they're sung by extraterrestrials.
Eh, Mickey, it's getting late.
Yeah.  Me, too.
Right.  Yeah.  I had a...
...I had a great time tonight, really.  It was like the Nuremberg Trials.
I remember you.
...in a really horrible way.
You look wonderful.  You do.  What happened to you?
Well, I hope you've changed.
Yeah, and for yours.  I'm sure you've changed.
Probably not.
I'm not anymore.  I haven't, I haven't been in television for a year.
Oh, well.
Fabulous, I mean it!  I'm so impressed.
I am.  You-you made my day.
Well...  I'll tell you.  One day about a month ago...
Oh, yeah?  What?
Just a few minutes ago.
Get a garter belt...  Get a garter belt and flirt.
Yeah, okay, right.  Forget it.  What's to eat?
You know, you've been picking on her ever since she came in here. Now just leave her alone for a while!  I'm just suffocating. 
Well, I was born Jewish, you know, but, uh, but last winter I tried to become a Catholic and...it didn't work for me.  I-I studied and I tried and I gave it everything, but, you know, Catholicism for me was die now, pay later, you know. And I just couldn't get with it. And I, and I wanted to, you know. I--
Take our literature...
I'm going to tell you later....
I have not read you your rights.
Orderly.
Yes, I presumed it was about him.
Let's just say they got a passion for collectibles...
Now, whyn't you help us?
Oh, yes.  He's found Peace.
All y'got to do is <u>ask</u>... 
You want me to solve all your problems tonight...?
And who is "they?"
M'I gonna see you tonight?
...I have never met a man who was so well beloved.
...would you excuse me...?
They got that kind of money?
Impossible.
Not with any certainty we...
Seen what, sir..?
Waal, Nobody's <u>Perfect</u>... What do we hear from our songbird in Switzerland?
Show me the Pigs.
Good evening, Dr. Lechter.  Thank you for coming.  I am sorry that we could not meet under more pleasant circumstances.
He... would consider it a favor if he could make a <u>donation</u>.  To a charitable institution of your choice. 
Before "The Change," Mr. Verger was... he made quite a study. 
Mmm...
...what's he got against you?
You seen John Brigham...?
...standard issue...
I'm going to work for your reinstatement...
Well, you know, that happens, on the street.
How's your <u>child</u>?
And how do we account for the interest of such a charming man, an interest in Torture?
...how so?
I know that the officers who first investigated his disappearance searched for a <u>note</u>, a farewell note, a suicide note...
You looked oddly at me, back on the landing.
How so?
You resemble a figure from the Della Robia Rondels, in your family's chapel at Santa Croce.
Well, if you will excuse me.  Madame. What a pleasure.
We got KittyKat...
...who say...?
...get outta my way, you sonofa<u>bitch</u>...
Thank you.  No, I know you'd prefer "I'm glad you <u>find</u> me so..."
Thanks to <u>you</u>...
I'm afraid, this wine is making me woozy...
...but will that satisfy you?
Yes, to cease to Hope is the Greatest Crime.  The Greatest crime.  Perhaps the <u>only</u> crime.  <u>I</u> never ceased to hope!
Every suicide kills two.
Y'want to gimme Brigham's pistol?
Why?
Because it is exclusive... because <u>everyone</u> will be here...
It's a <u>joke</u>.  You're a joke.  You're a joke.  You don't know what money <u>is</u>-- your idea of money...  ...spend it on a whore on your 'business trip.'  That is the fine limit of your ambitions...
Oh, my <u>program</u>...
What shape is the scar?
I'm sure there is, but my young Friend here, would <u>kill</u> you. 
The great and <u>beautiful</u>...
It is a gravestone in the cemetery of ______ in my native Florence.
...a case, so, so <u>fascinating</u>, so...
...yes, yes, yes....
I don't <u>think</u> so.
...no...
Well, no...  That's... I appreciate your <u>help</u>, but... 
...would you use a small word?
How do you think that made him feel?  What does that <u>mean</u>, "to go beyond the institution...?" 
And you have been <u>dreaming</u>... dreaming about this Hat, and...
...yes...?
When?
Isn't it funny?  You can look on my face  which you would grant me, is the most hideous sight you will see in what I hope is a long life. You can look at me.  Which shows  a Strength which <u>must</u> come from strong  strong convictions.   But you <u>shy</u> when I say the name of God.
I can be a good pig. Babe. Charlotte's Web. Good pig. Watch.
Why are you...don't stop...why?
Yeah...Are we going to do it or what? I still haven't packed.
Don't raise your voice at--I gave you the ultimate male fantasy--sex, nothing on the side. Don't pretend we shared anything other than fluids.
You have no idea. Now run away.
Call me conservative, but I'd rub my penis on the faces of all the ladies before bestowing the final honors to the divine Ms. Berry's lovely visage.
I was pretty confident that I was going to blow it with Talia, but I must say, I outdid myself.
Uh, yeah, that's...wow.
Wha-at?  What is it?
What are you gonna do about it?
Why am I so--That's new--The way I figure it is if I can get through to just one camper...then I'm a pretty incompetent counselor.                                           ] Don't get caught. I'll deny                                 ] everything.                                                 ]
Sorry about all that...I'm your CIT-- Jasper.
Hey, I thought I wasn't your type.
Thanks a lot. Seriously though, by winning this bet, you will prove to the world that you indeed know everything.  Isn't the rush of gambling on your cynical philosophy of life enough?
I didn't realize I had to declare a major.
The oak where Jocelyn sprained her ankle.
Yeah. And?
Ooh look, time to confiscate my first water balloon...
I just never thought of you in that...
So what?                                                    ]
Yes you do.
Don't worry, you...
I should leave. You probably need your rest.
Be nice. Her father died in that TWA flight the government shot down...You know I'm going to be in the city next week.

Thank you, my love.                                         ]
Don't get cocky, girl.
That's bullshit. Just shoot.
It's not my style, okay?
You're beautiful.
Like last night, Veronica?
You did last night.
Because you're an idiot.
Color me impressed. I thought you grew out of Betty Finn.
Like I give a shit. They all want me, as a friend or a fuck. I'm worshipped at Westerburg and I'm only a Junior.
Don't worry. David says he's very so he's very.
Color me nauseous.
Yes. Yes. We'll work something out. I swear to God. Won't we J.D.?...J.D.?
Heather.
Yeah, where's your urge to purge?
Uh-huh.
Suicide is a private thing.
Really? That thing in the caf today was pretty severe.
Time out....Jason Dean. Your Pop's Fred Dean Construction. Must be rough. Moving place to place.
S'okay....
See the condoms in the grass over there. We killed tonight, Veronica. We murdered our baby.
That only proves my point more. The word is a badge for her failures at school.
They used them on themselves to make it look like they were dead. Really quite a brilliant device, but too flamboyant to seriously produce.
Oh.
Did not.
"You say tomayto, I say tomahto. Let's call the whole thing off...Hold it!
You want to wipe the slate clean as much as I do. Okay, so maybe I am killing everyone in the school because nobody loves me. You have a purpose though! Remember? Let's face it, the only place different social types can genuinely get along with each other is in heaven.
Goddamn Geek!
Great pate, but I'm going to have to motor if I want to be ready for the party tonight.
Superb.
Heather was cool, but cruel. The good looks and bad manners gave her power, but it could not give her happiness.
Oh, I was scared of the same thing, Heather. The minute you try to deal with the actual teenagers who have contemplated suicide you're stepping into quicksand. Quicksand filled with bad complexions, bad grades, bad parents, bad drugs, and all sorts of doody nobody wants to hear let alone bend down to clean up.
We're pretty handy with model making, too, eh?
Actually, Mr. Rieper . . . it's a novel, and we'll be sending it to New York. That's where all the big publishing houses are based.
Look who I've found!
breaks down into heavy sobs.
Have a nice outing, you lot.
comes in with a breakfast tray: bacon and eggs, tea and toast.
Well, I guess I take after you then!
You ran off with Dad when you were only 17! Nana Parker told me!
It's a letter from the school . . . from Miss Stewart.
I don't wanna be in bloody school!
You're not going anywhere. You're 15 years old!!
Oh, no. I'm watching my figure.
looks down at the ground in front of her.
Oh, no . . . Mummy's awfully good at it.
Hello, Juliet. Juliet take off her jacket.
Thank you. I bought it especially, Mrs. Rieper.
Oh! I'll pop them in a bowl.
It doesn't matter.
This . . .
That . . .
God, yes!
Well . . . no. But it's so obvious.
I know, I'll lean forward and show more cleavage!
Do you think Bloody Bill's trying to get into her draws?
Don't worry, Gina! Mummy and Daddy love each other.
Let's go for a walk down here . . . come on, Mummy!
Your wife...?
Let me see. Oh yeah. My head feels like it's going through a meat grinder. I'm not sure if I'm dreaming or...
Easy there Trevor. You need to relax.
You need to get better first Trevor. Way better.  It's okay to miss somebody. It's okay to still love someone after they're gone. But you've got to quit blaming yourself okay...? Okay?
Well that's not necessarily a bad thing is it?
Allison we have GOT to talk about this medication you've got me on.
Bull...
You were unfaithful, it sounds like your confessing.
No you don't understand. That's why I've been fighting to get you better. So you wouldn't be a patient anymore.
Really? Do tell.
I followed her Trevor. I got to know her life. And what a boring one it was. Six a.m. gym, nine a.m. trendy coffee shop, noon bookstore, one soap operas, four o'clock news, five wait for Trevor to come home. And wait and wait and wait. Nine o'clock get ready for bed. 
Where's Allison?
What's the difference?
Zero's a number right?
Sorry I just kind of... spaced for a second there.
I'm... I'm doing a very special thing here. And you can't even ... respond?
You've been cheating on me haven't you?
Roughly two thirds of married men who cheat start during the eighth month of their wives' first pregnancy.
It's okay it was just a nightmare that's all.
Yes. Now go back to sleep. You're driving the rest of the way to gramma's remember?
It's perfect.
Where's my wife?
Well they'd have to prove it in a court of law for one thing-
Seeing you were her sole benefactor, and I'm the executive of the will, Kirsty's entire estate would have to be donated to the city.
I was going to say dimensions. But I guess technically they are dreams.
Look, whatever your Marharagi, told you, forget. You've got to get this fuckin pain to stop.
I don't even know what's real and what isn't how can I trust anyone?
I've never said this to a woman before but can't we talk a little bit before grabbing at each other?
You must have been very proud of yourselves...
Well now there's a compliment.
I... think we need to talk, there's something really strange going on...
Nah, I fucked it up.  I was tryin' to impress this kid, don't ask me why.  I was gonna rescue his old man, but I couldn't find the poor bastard.  He musta blew up.  I got the hell outta there.  I didn't have the nerve to face the kid.
In bad weather, yeah.  Mostly I camp out in the woods.  I thought maybe you were down on your luck too when I picked you up.
LaPlante!
Jail!  Listen, Bubber...  This is crazy.  We could fall off of here.
Right.
Huh?  Whadda you mean?
You <u>woulda</u> gone in there, you wouldn'ta thought twice...  Trust me on that, that's the kinda guy you are.  For a guy like me, it's a momentary loss of sanity.  I wasn't thinking clearly.  Listen, I'm no hero, John.  I just want some dough and maybe a little favor. How much didja spend already on all that do-gooder bullshit?  You didn't spend it <u>all</u> didja?
I think our best course right now would be to focus on the Probation Officer's report...
And a son by your ex-wife?  Joseph.
It's November.
Some of it.  Right here.  I got some of it.  I'll get the rest as soon as I can.
So you can call me "naive," Mister LaPlante.
You mean John Bubber?
Mister LaPlante...
Mister LaPlante...
Nine.  I think.  Maybe ten.  Yeah, ten.  Nice kid.
I can't afford no better.  My ex, she attached my pay check for child support payments.  You looking for Bernie LaPlante by any chance?
You don't wanna know, Chick, you don't wanna know.  Those guys been in here?
The same thing that always happens! You blew it! And this time you broke your son's heart instead of mine!  He was so proud, looking forward to going to a movie with his father... and you let him down!  Like you let everybody down, always!  What did you do, take a mudbath?
He's in bed!  You're not gonna wake him and make him crazy, do you understand?  He comes home from the zoo, he wants to know if Elliot's a "war hero" like you... he wants to know how many people you killed...
I had to explain your tendancy to "exaggerate", How you were actually "in country" all of two weeks and how you killed about as many people as the other clerk-typists in your outfit, no more, no less...
He had one <u>tiny</u>, uncharacteristic moment of weakness.  That's not the same thing as a lifetime of petty crime...
Lie, you mean...
You media people, you think you can just go anywhere you want, spy on people.
You're a celebrity, John.  People are going to want to please you... or use you... or both.
Gale... you're a very nice person. I wouldn't want to hurt you... in any way...
Vietnam!
John, I know all about it.
I told them how you were upset we didn't save the guy...
"For Excellence in the Pursuit of Truth."
A "mystery guy!"  "Not a passenger." Who?
He'll do it.  You really-should have talked to him first.
She's flying to New York.  She's been nominated for a Silver Mike...
Relax, Wally.  He had the shoe and the shoe checks out.
Drake Hotel, Penthouse Suite.  Never stop worrying.  I figure we'll do a sidebar on what it's like to go from sleeping in your car and collecting cans to sleeping in the poshest suite in town.  Also Gale's onto something, digging into his background.
Quit?  She wants to quit?
For ten more minutes they love him, Wally.  I'm sick of him and I'm always about ten minutes ahead of the public.
Who lost a shoe?  Wash your hands.
Never reach out!
We're from Channel Four, yes.  We'd like to find --
We couldn't find his name on the buzzer or on the mailbox, but...
Don't be ridiculous.  I'm a reporter.
Whoa, check it out.
Let's watch some TV.
Well, it's for a woman.
Oh -- uh -- girlfriend.
It's great.  It's clean and airy and quiet -- there are trees and flowers.  There's still some fixing up I have to do, but it's coming along.
Listen, no one ever said expressing yourself to the opposite sex is easy, but when the time comes, you have to do it and you <u>hope</u> the outcome will be good for both of you. You come out of solitary and you rejoin the human race, as difficult as that sometimes can be.
Oh, fine.  She's gone away for a little while and when she comes back I've sort of resolved to really tell her how much I care for her.
I understand that.
Well, now, don't go creating some artificial environment for yourself.
It's not going to happen unless you make it happen, my friend. You're going to have to assert yourself a little bit more.  <u>Show</u> your affection.
-- General handyman, yeah.  I do carpentry, too, painting, almost any odd job around the house.  I do housesitting while the owners are away.  In fact, that's why I've been in the area.  I've been living very close by.  Here's the part that's giving you trouble, but I won't be able to get a replacement till the stores open tomorrow morning.
I was alone a lot as a child.  No one to compete with.  My parents ensured that I found happiness in the smallest things.  When you're all alone it's your own world, you don't have to take orders from anybody.  You don't necessarily believe the stories people tell you.
Because you <u>were</u> pretty?
Yeah, I'm okay -- it's been a long night.
'Who's afraid of the Big Bad Wolf, the Big Bad Wolf...'
Uh huh.
No, I told you.  A whiff of perfume on his shirt.
I've tried to get him to agree to one.  I just -- I don't know... I'm getting such weird vibes lately.
Here, take this out to the table.
I think we got it just in time before the ink dried.
One day before we know it it'll be an old house and we'll be old in it -- and I'll still be paying for it.
I know someone else who's sensitive.
Honey, you know what I've been like lately... I've been a total zombie.  I have no idea what that was doing in my pocket.
Did she water this plant?  It looks a little bent out of shape.
There might be some extras in the garage.
This is for the best, you know it is.  Why do my socks keep disappearing!
I am so sick to death of hearing <u>your</u> opinion of my state of mind, what <u>you</u> think is for my own good. Without me you'd still be twirling a baton at U.C. Santa Barbara. <u>You're</u> the final straw on this back, baby!
No, Philip, I don't want you coming back here.  And if you want to talk to me -- <u>call</u>.
We'll talk in the morning.
Not very long.  There have been a couple of bids already.
Isn't it?
-- A man.
No.
Oh yeah?  Where's the bed?
It's a double.
Really.
No joke, Lieutenant.
Parker.  We found him knocked out in the can.
Yeah -- how'd you know that?
I think it was England.
So?
Cut him loose.  The D.A. says you ain't got shit on this guy.
I see your point, Bedsoe, but I have to look at this from the law's point of view.  There's something missing here.  It's something I'm sure you've come across many times in your career.  It's called evidence.  Get me a murder weapon with his fingerprints on it.  Find me an eye witness.  Dig up a motive.  Until then we don't have a case against him.
No.
Maybe he was a lousy shot.
I hear you.
That's all?
Then it's worth the journey.
For what?
I'm sure they will.
She's the King's cousin.
What worries you?
No -- I will.
That doesn't matter.
I think you just like to eat dirt.
I know that for six months you've worked hard and asked for little. That you're a good and honest man. What more need I know?
Would'st you harm one who comes to aid you?
I lied.
Where do you go when your mind drifts?
You'll no see me again.
Aye.
What do you want?
You remind me of someone I used to know.
New York is dangerous place.
You're twenty minutes late.
Why?
A little -- yes.  My interest in coming here is profession.
Because I don't feel like sitting in a rubber room for forty-eight hours.
So?
--the crest of a lion and a dragon and a single word:  Courage.
And the other one -- he is like you?
How could they get by him?
I like my work.
I do not know -- and even if I did...
No.
I shouldn't have come back here.  It was a mistake.
Why?
My dreams died long ago.
I haven't lived life -- I've hidden from it.  I've existed in the shadows.
No.  The money, please.
Yes, sir.
I understand.
Maybe Glen already picked up the disks.
She'll be dead if you don't put your ass in that chair!
I'm going to my desk.
I didn't know he would have a gun!  It just went off!
We're on foot.  We can't get away.
Bullshit.  Why would Mars do that?
You're being stupid.  Check out the bathroom.  Maybe we can sneak out a window --
Are you totally stupid?  What does it look like?
Let me speak to Mr. Smith.  I want to hear it from him.
How about your two friends?  You don't have a man dying in there, do you?
How about the cop?
That's not going to happen, Dennis.  They won't give you a helicopter.
I'm going to put on an officer named Will Maddox.  You talk to him for a while.
You can't run with suitcases.
Dennis.
I don't know.
What do you mean?
Goddamnit, tell me what you <u>know</u>.  Did the cops go in?  Did Smith have the disks?
What hospital?
I also have a couple of million in cash. Call Sonny Benza.  Ask if I can keep it.
My wife and my daughter and the money. I'll bring the disks to the mall by the freeway, you bring my family.  We'll trade.
I think you got no choice.
Yeah.
You said they would be here, goddamnit! Where are they?
You said they would be here!
First my girls.  I get my girls, you get the other disk.
You're hiding, Jeffrey.  You're hiding from the job and you're hiding from me.
Be quiet!  Listen!
I don't see why you can't just lock me in.  It's not like I can go anywhere.
All three of us will go, but we have to move fast.  Mars and Dennis don't know I'm doing this.
Dennis and Mars are in the den.  I'll get your brother, then come back for you. We'll go down the stairs and out the front door, you understand?
Ain't gonna happen.  We've got unequal pupilation.  He could have an intracranial hematoma or a fracture or both.
Three white males shot Junior.  Mike followed them to York Estates --
We have a boy on the line.  He says he's Thomas Smith and he's calling from the house.
Then we don't know if she's part of this or not.  Mickey, you up?
Go, Chief.
I know the one.
Could you call me back on your phone? Right away.
Don't crowd the house.  The alpha's a kid named Rooney.  He's amped up and volatile.
Order your men to stand down.
Don't question me, Captain!  This is <u>my</u> crime scene!
Goddamned small town bullshit.
Contact the landlord.  I want to know employment, friends, family, anything we can find out about this guy.
Chief, it's Mikkelson.
Yes, sir.
You used to be a cop.  All of you used to be cops.  I can tell by the way you move.
You and I are gonna straighten this out with the Sheriffs, and then we'll wait for the man to call.  When he gives the word, we move.
Thomas Smith.  I'm in the house that's on TV.  Dennis hit my dad and now he won't wake up.  You gotta help him.
We're okay.
Can you get into the office?
What do you want?
We want them.  You will not let anyone go into that house--or anything come out-- until my people recover these disks.
Do you think I'm going to let you <u>murder</u> someone?!
I guess we do.
The Hutu-Tutsi thing. The BBC faxed to say they would be here on the sixth for the peace accords. And the U.N. wants the banquet room for that day, a reception to broadcast the signing ceremony. Can you organize monitors and check the satellite dish?
Why not? These are not rebels, look at them. Soon they will be worthless to you. Why not take some money, for your work?
Yes, Colonel Monsieur Xavier, the Minister of Finance.
Congratulations. You should spit in my face.
The police are very busy.
Well rewarded Those were his words.
I admire you, General. How do you keep command of your men amidst such madness?
I wish I were like you. Look at my staff, they won't work, they listen to no one.
No. We have no way of finding other stock but I have money for you from the guests.
After the Diplomat! Paul clambers in the back.
They can go where they want. They are in charge now.
No, sir.
I do not want to go to Gitarama, General.
How so.
I need rice, beans, beer, and your best whiskey.
You have no whiskey?
Gregoire, what are you doing here?
I am delighted to see you, Mr. Daglish.
I'm afraid I can't do that, Mr. Daglish.
Call, sir?
Rusesabagina. Paul Rusesabagina.
We are to meet Mr. Rutagunda.
I need one last favor. Go back and get the twins.
Move? Where to?
The third floor are low class rooms.
They will surely kill us here. It's over here. We have to take the chance.
Please, be quiet.
Murdered! By whom?
They came through the bushes, over the wall. What could I do?
Please. Let them stay 'til morning. The militia will not come here, they know you are a Hutu with influence.
No answer. Please send someone to get them, please.
Please go back, bring the children to us.
Enough of this. We stay together. Let me rest, I will feel better then.
What for Paul.
So where is the lamb?
Go out! Where?
No, no.
You cannot go alone.
In Ruhengeri?
What?
What was the bribe?  What am I worth to you?
No! Sit down now.
What's wrong?
Maybe. But in business class there are fine wines, linens, Belgian chocolates.
Sir, Gregoire has been taking beers.
When?
Not too big on it myself -- but then again, not on marriage either.
You're the Doctor, sweetheart. 'Guess the atropine worked, then.
-- "oh, no, Officer, I'm very much alive -- just a joke to beat my husband at his own clever game -- What? What do you mean he's dead? It's all my fault, I may as well have killed him myself!"
-- the James Dean wannabe with the hair trigger --
-- there's plenty: for all we know, Steven's got her spying on us right now --
-- but nobody has yet, Donald. They just haven't been brought to that breaking point. They have to believe proof-positive that their lives are in danger.
Name's Pritchett. Watson Pritchett. I own the house, my father built it. And now I just need to get you into it. So...
Oh dear.
More to the point. Where's our host?
-- uh, excuse me, just one quick question? How long before this damn thing unseals itself?
-- the "Saturation Chamber." Where he wanted to put me.
I think one of you has been part and parcel of making this situation!
-- fuck you!
I'm just the Greeter -- and in that capacity, I now urge you all strongly to --
A cleaning crew's supposed to arrive at 9:30 tomorrow morning -- I think the power of the house fades at dawn.
The Soul of the House. Everything that's corrupt about it... My father trapped it in there just before he died. You see, he purchased the house to restore it... We were going to live here... Nothing can live here. I was just a kid... The first time I saw it, I thought it was beautiful... It was just a dark mist turning into the corner of the room... then it started to move... then death started to happen... First the workers.. six in all... then my father...
What's life, anyway? Waves...? Sound...? Light...? Electricity...? I don't know... Phone lines...?
Poor Mr. Price --
Me? You've gotta be kidding.
And we get this money when?
Take the gun.
Best of a nightmare.
-- yeah, we did that --
Most of my business is making deliveries to high rollers. And I have yet to meet one Executive who could tie their own shoes -- let alone rewire an entire house. You don't fit the bill -- not even close.
An answer, I hope: exactly what -- or who -- Melissa was taping.
Sure, with three days and a blowtorch.
-- that's the fact, bud --
Back where?
Let's try down here...
We're safe?
How'd you make your guest list, Price: throw darts at a phone book?
Well, not quite. See, those people down there: they aren't the ones I invited.
Which part of that fantasy turns you on most: me with other men -- or just the other men?
Asking the wrong person again.
-- I pose you the same question --
You didn't think to ask?
What?
Are you still fucking <b>here</b>??
And then what happens?
Like what?? This isn't supposed to be happening!!
I think, Pritchett, we've got a situation here that even you can't explain away as "ghosts." This is ice- cold homicide by person -- or persons --
Something with the power, I don't know!!
I was chasing after somebody I saw in the salon.
Then just wait -- maybe this whoever's got you next on the Asylum's equipment- test list. Maybe a literal mind-blow inside the "Saturation Chamber."
-- confirming everything we already know --
The lockdown thing.
It better be -- he still owes me $25 grand for renting the place for the night! Here, let's get you some illumination so you can make your way safely!
Why not?
Believe me, we need to.
You'll never find it, it's a maze down there.
Not ghosts... at least not what you're thinking... Vannacutt used to dump the bodies of his failed experiments somewhere in the house...
He would have been back by now.
-- I'm coming --
What's the matter?
What was her name?
Thank you.  If you told me two years ago we'd be living here, I would never have believed it.  Do you live around here?
There were a series of lectures about parapsychology at my university.  I went and heard him speak, and became fascinated with the idea of hunting ghosts.
So was I.  The usual investigation turns up nothing more times than not.
I'm sorry.
It's origin is unknown.  The symbol does correspond  to a dagger I acquired many years ago.
By killing them?
Pearl, is the twilight, the divinity... Onyx is the sickle, death...
Sure.
We'll have every leprechaun in Ireland here honey.
I didn't do anything, mommy.
No it won't - no it won't!
She's down...how do you mean honey?
Ok...
We're going to go someplace new.
We'll get it later.
Go to your room!  Now!
What do you mean?  Mommy? You're scaring me!
Take me to her.
He's blessing the house.
That's great, honey.
Good night daddy.
The place is pretty dusty.
Will, maybe we should have separate bedrooms for a while.
Whatever you say.
I don't think she willed it to me out of sentiment.  She didn't even know who I was.  It's just... tradition.
She's asleep.  I think that's what I need, too. I'm starting to see things.
Didn't you just see the power go off and on?  I just had a bulb break on me!
Yeah, I'd say some weird things have happened.
You, an imaginary friend.  That's what she calls her.
You seem to appreciate the local scenery.
Should I...
We're not going.
I'm ok.
We usually find nothing.  We've debunked many a reported haunting. About ninety five percent of the cases had some technical explanation.
White meat will be fine...
Come back to us honey, don't be afraid!
How can I help you?
Thank you.
It can't hurt you if you're not afraid Aubrey.  Think about us. We're here for you, we love you...
I wish I had an answer.  Evil is powerful, more so every day it seems.  But I believe the worst for you and for this house is behind us.
Yes, they are.
We'll be there.
Oh.
Not really.  Oh, wait a minute.
What?
Yeah?  Well, you just struck out.  It may be a surprise to you, Brad, but I want to do it the right way.  Not tight skirts.  Tight stories.
Joey ....  Look, you wanna ride?  I can go by your place.
Correct.  The fields of France.  And many dead flowers ... Oh.  Forgive me. My name was Spenser.  Elliott Spenser. Captain.
And what did you discover?
Because - monster as I was - I was bound by Laws.  The protocol of Hell.  The Box had to be opened to let me out.  The truly innocent were safe.  That's no longer true.  The shell of the beast has been fleshed.  What I was is out there, Joey.  In your world.  Unbound. Unstoppable.
He'll do what he does best.  But he'll do it unfettered.  He wants to walk the Earth forever, indulging his taste for all the myriad subtleties of human suffering.
So where is it?
I want to talk to you.  We met ... now, listen, don't hang up, OK? ... We met at the hospital last night.
Of course tonight.  Is that a problem? Like, if you've got a guy there or something ...
Sorry.
No ... I mean, it's not like great about your dad or anything.  It's just I don't dream.  Never have.  ... Maybe it'd help if I slept sometime ... Just kidding ... No, so it's always neat for me to hear about dreams.  I'm jealous.  It's like everybody has another world except me. You know what I mean?
I'm trying to quit.
Did you know him?
Wait a minute.  He was already ... wounded ... when you found him?
Wait.  Wait.  The chains.  Where did the chains come from?
The bank owns it.  But I'm working on it.
No.  I buy them to impress people.  Of course I've read them.
I don't think so.  But it's a fascinating subject.  Did you ...
Would you know this store again?
Help me pick 'em up, Terri.  I think the lady just made a sale.
Thank you for the drink.  And the rose. Wow.  That's ... really nice.
A prize?  For what?
I'm sorry.
Wow.  Thank you.
What!?  What are you talking about?  Why should I help you?
Hey, that's what makes the world go round.
But how in God's name ...
Will you relax?  Your little girlfriend left a card, remember?
No.  I mean, really?  Because I'm concerned for you, sweetheart.  I care about you.  I guess I miss you.  I'm sorry we split up.  I'm sorry I ...
Hey, it has been known.  C'mon Terri, I'm not that bad a guy.  I have regrets. I'd like to put things right.  Don't tell me you haven't thought about me. Huh?
That's so good to hear, sweetheart.  It really is. You know, I .. are you alone?
Terri, listen.       Why don't you come here and kiss me?  I mean, it's probably ticking away in both our minds, right?  Is it going to happen?  Isn't it going to happen?  Let's get it out of the way.  See how we feel.  Then we can relax.  Talk.  You know.
Sure.  Sure.  I understand.  It's cool. I mean, we've got all night.
No.  It isn't ... she wouldn't ... It's like I must have done something wrong, you know?  Freaked her out.  Just fucked up something good again.
Now that you're born again,what do you wanna do?  Statue of Liberty?  Entertain some ladies? Miss Saigon tix?  Seduce some women?  Play Nintendo?  Bone some chicks?
I read about these people in Newsweek.  Where's all the regulars, Crazy Jeff Cava, the Todd sisters, Indian Joe?  Where's Ed Kranepool's autograph?  Captain Bob's steering wheel?
Rutherford Auction... that name...
"He kicks up at anything he hears.
"And though he's slippery, he still gets caught."
Oh, not much.  Gates just had his tonsils taken out.  The hard way.
Ah yes, a rare Renaissance piece. Da Vinci's "Sforza," an equestrian model of a never executed statue. I consider it to be the prize of tonight's auction of objets d'equestrian.  Horse things.
Geez, this Art Treasures Room looks like a burnt diaphragm.
Why not just go now?
Anna, I think you better stay....
Too-do-loo, babe.
Yes way.
George, you promised.  No Old CIA/ New CIA jokes...
Close call, but she's our only way of keeping tabs on that damn mysterious Vatican organization. Hawk, it's time to go to the principal's office....
Snickers, baby, I love you like a brother, but really, who cares? Silencer bomb...
A little petting is not the issue!
Forget about it--it was nothing-- anybody would have done the same thing--It's an impulse...
Excuse me, Milady.  I would have flown over and carried you up to a pink cloud, but I left my cape at the cleaners.
Yes, and my giraffe loves it, too...
I'll bring my entire repertoire...
Secret passageways don't mean as much as they used to.  There's a place two blocks east of here. Enzo's.  Say 10:30.
Uh....old badminton injury.
Somebody robbed the Vatican.
I told you not to call me Hudson. The only people who called me that were the nuns at...
Yeah, but what would happen if that little mirror came out of the crystal.
Actually he never told us what it was.
Sure.  Face down.  Two endearing shots to the back of the head. That's your mark, man.  What did Little Eddie ever do to...
Like a "cat", one could say.
You could host American Bandstand in here.  Why did you duck at the auction, asshole?
What job?
It'll take a couple of years of steady production, but I'll flood the market with so much gold that gold itself, the foundation of all finance, will lose its meaning. Brokers, economists, and fellow entrepreneurs will drown in the saliva of their own nervous breakdowns.  Markets will crash- crash.  Financial Empires will crumble-crumble.
Too bad.
Yeah, right.  By the way, as long as I'm getting things off my chest, I'm the one who killed your little monkey.  Made it look like a Mafia hit.  Did it for fun. Ciao.
The Circle-o'-Gaiety!
We dumped the whole load. Now quit showboating, Addison --
Sure, sure, we'd all be millionaires. There's no point in looking back. At the time, Stilson thought dumping our position would panic the market, further depress the stock -- then we'd buy it all back, and more of course, once it got cheap --
I don't tell no one nothin' lessen they ask. Thatches ain't ole Moses' way.
But then I figured it out: they did it 'cause they figured young Norville for an imbecile. Like some othuh people ah know.
'Cause they's little pigglies! They's tryin' to inspire panic, make that stock git cheap so's they can snitch it all up fo' themselves! But Norville, he's got some tricks up his sleeve, he does...
Them po' young folks. Looks like Norville's in fo' the same kind o' heartache ol' Warin' had. But then, she never axed me 'bout dat...
Yeah, I was all wet about your idea man... Well, thanks for being so generous... It is human, and you are divine... No, he's no faker. He's the 100% real McCoy beware-of- imitations genuine article: the guy is a real moron --
I know they're gonna buy that stock --
But, Al, it's the bunk! Norville showed me his design for the whatsit the day I met him! Why Buzz couldn't have invented it -- look at the man -- he's an imbecile!
Oh, Buzz is pretty harmless, really --
I myself --
Mind if I join you?
Well, I just don't know how to thank you, Mr. Barnes --
-- or lack thereof?
Oh sure, you're biased -- you're a fellow Muncian. But would an imbecile come up with this?
Yeah, you know. Probably dresses in men's clothing, swaps drinks with the guys at the local watering hole, and hobnobs with some smooth talking heel in the newsroom named Biff or Smoocher or...
Oh, I don't blame them, really. I guess I have sort of made a mess of things. These folks have to protect their investment. Most of them are very nice people --
No! In Vidalia! Farm Route 17!
Oh no, Amy, pardon me for saying so but I find that very farfetched.
Well yes, we're pruning away some of the dead wood, but if --
Know about it? You think the Board would do anything like this without my authorization? No, this was my idea from the start.
We have to be realistic, Amy. You know things have slowed down a little here at Hudsucker --
Now, Aim --
Worked in a watch factory?
Well that just about does it! I've seen Norville Barnes, the young man in a big hurry, and I've seen Norville Barnes the self-important heel, but I've never seen Norville Barnes the quitter, and I don't like it!
Whatever. That's what sells newspapers.
So ya see, I won't be in the mailroom long.
What kind of bar is it if ya can't get a martini?!
This I know, Benny.
Yeah, but, buddy --
But, buddy, you were --
And don't call me buddy! Out of here! Out!
Get up!
We don't crawl at Hudsucker Industries! Get out of my office! Leave your uniform in the locker room!
Sure, Mr. Muss -- uh, Sid said I could have the job back.
And Sid says you stole it!
Yes sir...
Well, why don't ya read it.
'...But Sid, let me urge you to work closely with the new president, and to keep giving Hudsucker Industries all your energies -- but not your soul. For while we must strive for success, we must not worship it. Long live the Hud. Waring Hudsucker...'
That must have been quite a disappointment, Mrs. Mussburger.
I --
But, sir! --
Oh my God, sir!
Oh my God, sir!
Lobby. We haven't got all day.
-- So if you think it's appropriate, I'd like to bounce the idea off a few people at lunch --
Ya get the special?
She looks in her purse...
The mark notices.
Where?
Are you trying to tell me that the Houngan -- the voodoo priest -- could cure Mrs. Holland?
So -- he says I'm nice.  He's a nice boy, too, Miss Connell, a very nice boy.  But I'm worried about his drinking.
I don't mean believe, like believing in a religion.  I mean, do you believe it has power?  Do you think it could heal a sick person?
But you didn't have to come up here.
I've never heard of a cure.
Fortunately, not.  This is my first experience with it as a physician. But I have seen half-witted field hands -- whom the other peasants call Zombies.  I am sure they suffer from a similar destruction of spinal nerves as the result of high fever.
No, this is quite final.  You see, Mr. Holland is a sugar planter.  He lives in St. Sebastian Island in the West Indies.
I went to school in Buffalo.  Paul went to school in England.
We're half-brothers.  Paul is mother's first child.  When his father died, she married my father. Dr. Rand, the missionary.  And you know what they say about missionaries' children.
Of course.  It's been nice of you to spend this much time with me.
It'll wait.
Higher mathematics.  Two ounces to a drink -- three drinks, six ounces.
Did you hear what he sang?
You can't really believe that.
I'm not sure I can make you understand.  You know what this is?
Yes.  But it was once the figurehead of a slave ship.  That's where our people came from -- from the misery and pain of slavery. For generations they found life a burden. That's why they still weep when a child is born -- and make merry at a burial.
Nothing -- really.  But you must admit it's an eerie sort of place -- so dark --
Yes, he can.  But I've been wondering -- you know if you could leave the whisky decanter off the table --
Still, I feel you should remove the decanter.  Wes is not an alcoholic yet, Mr. Holland. But as a nurse I can tell you that it won't be long before he is.
I often do.
Help me? How?
You have deliberately endangered Mrs. Holland's life.  There's no telling what you may have started with this insanity.  Why did you do it?
I hated myself.  I kept saying to myself over and over again that these people had no power; they had no strange drugs; that there is no such thing as a Zombie.
But I had no thought of harming her.  It wasn't I...
Don't see how. I think the public's had its fill of this gangster stuff. No, trust me -- disaster pics. And air hockey.
Yeah, see you bright and early Monday am.  Say, where's the wife?
No thank you. We should be off.
That shrink -- the one you always wanted me to see? I thought you dropped him.
Good night.
That shirt?
Leave it -- I'll wash it for you.
What's on your mind? Don't --
Sure I do. Do I know what loneliness feels like? Sure I do. I know a lot about it, if that's what you mean.
I know, I know. I had no idea --
Elena.
Hey guy. Things ok up there? You all right?
Lab experiments? Right smart guy -- Paul, you know your mother's gonna be disappointed not to see more of you -- In fact, let me make this more than a simple request guy, I think you should...
Hnnn.
Sure dad.
Stay out of trouble.
Libbets. Libbets Casey.
You're boring me. I have a husband. I don't particularly feel the need for another.
Have I noticed anything? I'm not married to her Benjamin, you are. I think you've probably a better vantage point from which to observe her.
Jimmy? Jimmy? I don't know how to take this. And what do you mean, Jimmy? I thought you said you and your husband --
I just can't believe you could be so --
Good night kiddo.
-- 73, and divorce is as easy as paying off a traffic ticket, and for crying out loud, Ben, be a man and just get it over with. I would have if I'd had the chance.
Alright dad. But you sold the house, you didn't tell anyone, including the IRS, and I'd of certainly liked to have seen if there was any old stuff --
I thought I'd start trying. If you don't mind. But I am going to Florida and I do have a new nurse.
Well, we can talk about it.
Maybe you just need -- look, can you wait here a sec, I need to tidy up -- just a minute, I'll be right back. You'll wait?
Yeah. You?
Hi Wendy.
I thought you quit the band - I never hear you practice anymore.
Well, I'm sure your father and I would love to hear what you're playing these days. Maybe after dinner.
It's not like we're too busy.
I suppose my reluctance was the group aspect of it -- I've never been much of a joiner, although I still consider myself a somewhat religious person --
I hope you changed the water in that bong from last night.
And remember, with your erogenous zones lubricated as such with the mighty herb, do not attempt terrestrial contact with members of the opposite sex -- because you drone on like a motherfucker when you're stoned.
Do what?
Francis. You gonna leave the seeds in there? In the binding like that?
Like into one of the other 20 or so bathrooms they've got in this place.
Yeah, Paul, are you gonna get home okay?
Groovy.  Young master of the revels, a treat for our hostess?
Let's see!
I don't know.
Yeah. Yours?
Yeah well wait till mom opens her mouth.
Why don't you use the phone downstairs?
With who?
Libbets? What kind of a name is Libbets?
Hey Sandy, what were you blowing up out there? Your mom was pretty p.o.'d.
Vodka?
What's that, then?
Got a love affair with police work. Drives me crazy with it.
What's the D.A. got them on?
I had him!
The Puffins and the Hawks.  We're in extra innings.  The Hawks have a really good line-up this year.
It's okay.  Happened a long time ago.  He was killed in a fire.  In New Mexico.
Okay.
I don't remember.
Why?
Where is he?
Mrs. Connell found this copy in the house.  It's signed.  Personally.
That's right.
Even the best make mistakes.
Cut some kind of a deal.  I heard that's what Flynn's doing...
Don't do this, Hap...
I'm always all business.
Huh?
Huh?
What kind of stuff?
Thought you wanted something fun...
Who?
What was it?
Yes.
Ah! You have questions?
Surely you know the one who made you...
And no vampire here has discourse with God or the Devil?
You said there were none.
Like moths around the candle of the age. Decadent, useless. They can't reflect anything. But you do. You reflect its broken heart.
Louis, I swear I did not.
It's bet in the beginning, lest the death takes you down with it. yes, that's it. My child. My beloved child.
What night? What do you mean?
You dress me like a doll. You make my hair like a doll. Why?
What you are? You would be something other than you are?
Be glad I made you what you are! You'd be dead not if I hadn't.
Is that supposed to frighten me?
You're a liar. But you upset my plans.
Yes. It killed them, unfortunately. But it keeps the blood warm.
Hush, Claudia don't talk about such things. Show me your book.
And he found me with you. I ran, sickened at what I'd done. Then he cut his wrist and fed you from him. I tried to stop him, but you were a vampire then. And have been every night hereafter.
He'll never let us go.
I can't. Go away from me.
And you never cried -
It was something hurries...and seldom savoured... something acute that was quickly lost. It was the pale shadow of killing.
You are more beautiful than any of them.
Yes. Should I take her, Louis? Among her dolls? make a doll of her in turn?
They are here. I know they are. Listen for something that doesn't make a sound.
Be still!
Then my luck would have changed.
They are gone, Louis. Death took them. Death which you can now destroy...
I want it!
I can't go through with it, I tell you.
But why do you want me?
Dying?
I can't.
What you wouldn't do. It's almost sunrise. It will be the sun or the fire. You said they can kill me. The sun or the fire!
Where do you think, my idiot friend? We're in a nice filthy cemetery. Does this make you happy? Is this fitting and proper enough?
I'm not interested in you. You disgust me. I'm interested in my own nature and know I can't trust you to tell me the truth about me.
You finish her - if you feel so much -
You remember how you wanted her, the taste of her -
Louis, Louis, I gave you the gift --- help me ---
CLAUDIA!!!
That's all past, Lestat.
If you stayed with me Louis, I could venture out... little by little... become the old Lestat.
Yes but you needn't worry about that now. Things change.
We can't begin this way. Let me turn on the light.
Yes!
And, while you're here, our marginally trained, off-season staff of five will attend to your every need.
July fourth weekend. Storm season starts today. The clouds roll in like clockwork.
Not possible, I'm afraid. The last ferry left hours ago. And we got a storm coming. There won't be another one for days.
Stupid. What were you thinkng?
Fish are all over the water...Come on, let us take a boat out.
That's why you'll come with Titus, mon.
Up-tighteous and self-righteous.
What are you doing in my closet?
Listen to me, Julie. Ray's a great guy, nothing against old Ray, but he's so...Ray. I mean, he lives in Southport. Will's a nice guy, too, and he lives right down the street.
Julie, people who end up making rules like that end up beating their kids with wire hangers. It's a fact.
No, I'm the King of the World.
I will, and you remind me of the same thing.
Yes.
Yes.
Just kidding.
Rio isn't the capital of Brazil. It was the wrong answer. Sorry, we lose.
I've got to see.
Then, we fight --
Can't what?
Tyrell, you are an unstoppable force of nature.
I told you.
I don't know.
Wait, it's Nancy --
I'm fine.
It was in a church...it was so real. I mean, I could feel his breath on me.
I thought I was over the dreams for good. I really did. I hadn't had one for months.
I'm okay.
What if I don't have anything happy from childhood...Sorry, I can't relax going five hundred miles an hour, or four thousand, four hundred feet a minute...  Which is over seven hundred feet a second. Imagine hitting something at seven hundred feet a second.
He did something to the screen...it, it, said...
We had a connection, didn't we? I can tell you one thing, though. Ray didn't trust me. He was right. He's dead, but he was right.
Why? Come on, Julie. Think. You'll get it. Will Benson -- Ben's son.
They all start to look the same once you've worked in one.  Am I right, sister?
Why?
Baby, I finally got you alone in this Jacuzzi and I don't wanna be discussin' hair care.
Hey --
We gotta get out of here. Now.
Ladies and gentlemen, please put your hands together for my friend, my very best friend, Julie James.
How much?
Make it three hundred. And throw that in, too.
I'm not waiting...So give me the gun and keep the ring.
Tell me this ain't the bar scene.
Not anymore.
The rest of us see bathrobes.
How's the water?
You don't have to be a jerk.
You know, the greenhouse effect has caused the gulf stream to shift and almost every meteorological expert expects a dramatic increase in tropical depression --
Yeah, wait right here, it's the safest place.
In case you do so, would you --
He won't even know you're there. He is delirious.
Don't bother. Go to bed and get some sleep. I'll be working late.  I can hear any movement down here.
May life be good to you both. As for the others  they will be quiet here  and I will be with them.
Good winds and bad winds!
Let us put it to the test. Protect yourself with every scientific precaution you can think of. I'll go out on the cliff and build a votive fire to Hermes -- not that I believe in him any more than I do in Science.
I'll get Ida to make up your bed.
How could we go back to the wars with such pleasant company here..
No one can take my father's place.
On my word! That's what they believe.
Poor Cathy --
If only we could get away - - you and I. The others are strangers, they mean nothing to me
I'm so ill, I'm so exhausted -- I almost don't care.
Some village in the mountains -- Alethera, I think.
She has never mentioned her family.
No, that's Thea's bed. Miss Wollsten's bed is in there.
And the soldier -- He looked at me so strangely -- who is he?
Why, I love my father because - because I do. Of course, he's nice to me.
How do you know what my father thought - -
You wouldn't tell that 
This is Dr. Drossos, chief medical officer of my division.
I wanted to be sure of something, General -- something that has always preyed on my mind. I have a horror of being buried alive and awakening to find myself shut in - entombed  imprisoned..
Because he was a brave man - because I liked him -- I came here to be sure.
Yes?
You ask that of me? You're afraid to live in your coffin. You know what that means?
Why -- no not before Thea came 
Maybe you've got the wrong crypt  after all it's twenty years when you wore last here.
We have no time for that.
You are my friend.
Listen to what I say --
I can't.
For a moment, when he looked at me so sadly, I felt that I had wronged him. But then --
No -- you musn't. He thinks I've bewitched you. He won't believe it - he'll hate me even more! My only chance is to stay away from him.
Well, you're begging, and that's a whole lot worse.
Then foreclose!
So I suppose I should give it to miserable failures like you and that idiot brother of yours to spend for me.
What did . . .
Well, you look about like the kind of an angel I'd get. Sort of a fallen angel, aren't you? What happened to your wings?
Only one way you can help me. You don't happen to have eight thousand bucks on you?
I said I wish I'd never been born.
You've never been born. You don't exist. You haven't a care in the world.
Our clothes are dry.
Well, I had a car, and it was right here. I guess somebody moved it.
It isn't me!
You'll see a lot of strange things from now on.
No.
No wonder you jumped in the river.
Why? Don't they believe in angels?
No, of course not.
Where is she?
If you ever get your wings, you'll see all by yourself.
That's him when he was twelve, back in 1919. Something happens here you'll have to remember later on.
That's the kid.
That's right. Not only that, but he gave his school money to his brother Harry, and sent him to college. Harry became a football star  made second team All American.
Yes, but George . . .
What's that book you've got there?
Clarence, you do a good job with George Bailey, and you'll get your wings.
Get over what? I don't take in strangers unless they're sent here by somebody I know.
That's a lie. He's been in the insane asylum ever since he lost his business. And if you ask me, that's where you belong.
Yeah, all right. Now, I'll paste this together.
I know  I know, but you just go to sleep, and then you can dream about it, and it'll be a whole garden.
Yeah  old Joe College Wainwright, they call me. Well, freshman, looks like you're going to make it after all.
All in . . .
Oh  Welch. That's what I get for praying.
Looks like she can keep Harry on his toes.
Oh, stop that grunting.
Hmmm?
Well, she's not crazy about him.
Ummmm . . .
Don't hurt my ear again!
No. No.
Maybe you were born older, George.
Still after that first million before you're thirty.
Very funny. Very funny.
Come on, George, let's hurry.
Oh, wait. Wait . . . Wait a minute.
She was here first.
Why, of course you can. Come on in the office here.
Here, now, you're broke, aren't you?
What do you want to do, hock your furs, and that hat? Want to walk to New York? You know, they charge for meals and rent up there just the same as they do in Bedford Falls.
Yeah  yeah . . . sure I will.
I'm not going to go, George. I changed my mind.
How do you do.
Well, how do you do. Congratulations. Congratulations. What am I doing?
Right down here.
George . . .
I just did, but they said you left. This is a pickle, George, this is a pickle.
About an hour ago. I had to hand over all our cash.
Would I?  You're not talking to somebody else around here, are you? You know, this is me, you remember me? George Bailey.
I'd like to do that.
Neither am I.
Eighteen? Why, it was only last year you were seventeen.
Oh, no. Just right. Your age fits you. Yes, sir, you look a little older without your clothes on.
Oh, no, don't. I love that old house.
Well, then you could swallow it and it'd all dissolve, see? And the moonbeams'd shoot out of your fingers and your toes, and the ends of your hair.  Am I talking too much?
I'm going to scream!
Tuesday.
To keep from being an old maid.
Yeah, just started.
Oh, she's got a cold. She's in bed. Caught it coming home from school. They gave her a flower for a prize and she didn't want to crush it so she didn't button up her coat.
Mary! Let me touch you! Oh, you're real!
You have no idea what's happened to me.
What plates?
Oh, no you don't. Harry, now, not my best Haviland.
What?
With the right wind, 15-20 knots.
With butter, if they got any....
So's mine.
But of course.
They're moving pretty fast.
Yeah.
Yee-hah!
Lucky.  Lucky, lucky, lucky.
We'll take your supercargo.
Like hell!  We're on the starboard tack!
What the hell, we're steering for it.
Anyone got another set of sails?
Oh, yeah.  Sure.
Abandoned?  It's a little early in the season for that.
If I had a $100,000 boat, I sure as hell wouldn't leave it anchored alone in the channel.
In here.
If there is, develop it!
About an hour, maybe two.  Let's see -- I came on about eight....
Every day?
Oh, c'mon.
Sean's still out there.
Stay here.  Don't go anywhere. Just stay here.
Sorry, I'm all booked up...  Come, m'dear.
Look -- I just got this from Phil Fogarty.  It was in the camera belonging to the missing divers. It proves I was right, all along.
My ass!
Because this big fish has been bitten by some other big fish....
Jesus, don't quibble with me.  I want to know if a Great White Shark did this.
That's it?  Probably?  Look, sharks are attracted by blood, and thrashing around....
Late.
Fooling around?
Home it is.
For me?
Damn.
Careful.  What's wrong?
Oh.  Want to talk about it?
Terrific.
Fired me!  I'm not a hysterical man.  I'm responsible.  I know what I saw....
Don't rush into it -- we may need the income.
Of course.  Look -- I've got some missing persons, fatalities, evidence of a large predator....
Go ahead, whatever it's worth.
That's it?
1530 hours.  Might still be there. Base out.
You stay with Mrs. Silvera, Tootsie. Okay?
Dad!  Dad!
Shh.  Shhh....
It's all right, we're okay.
Waiting for Andy.
Who'd you ask?
What's that mean?
Wait a minute.  Promise me something.
Anything?
Is there something I don't know about?
I love it.
If we beat them, they can both go home stag!  Single-O!  Alone! Jackie can come back in this boat!
Sean, baby, please....
Anyone want to go the lighthouse?
Yeah.
I'm not in the way.  Andy, am I in the way?
I'm only walking him.  You caught him.  You have to be exhausted.
Get the hose!  We've got to force more water through the gills and oxygenate him!
No one's ever caught a Great White except indirectly in fishing nets. I want to dart it and keep it alive.
Yeah.  Down there.
Don't let him get you.  Just continue your patterns and pretend he's not around.
Honey, I gotta go.
Everything's going wrong.  I'm having more trouble with Bobby than I ever have before.  I can't get him to respond.
... Hutton.  He really pisses me off.
No, you don't need all that starch.  You're getting too fat.
We play hide and seek all the time.  They find a lot of things.
That's a lot of ground to cover.
Nothing.
Michael, the sub's dead.
No, you're not.
... Me, too.
Get some sleep.  And tell Sean I'm sorry.
How's your patient?
Me, too.
What's up?
... Mean through the tubes?
So tell Calvin.
Well then, can you have them jump to the camera over here?
I think we can capture it.  I'd like to try.
I've handled sharks before. Bigger than this one.
No!
Well, then I'm going to film it.
We're taking that shark alive!
Afraid I can't do that.
Why are you?
You're a strange man, Mr. Hutton.
We're all from the sea, Mr. Hutton. Our destiny is linked to the fate of the oceans.  By continuing to destroy fish, man destroys himself.
Thanks to you.
Sure.
Someone's looking for you.
How you doing, Kelly?
... Massachussettans aren't.
Well, wait till you see the rest.
Goes back to when I was a kid. Mike's okay, he's gotten over his fears, but I haven't.  I can't even drink it.
And alone.
No.  Of course not.  Don't listen to him.  He's - he's...  ... my brother.
The one that goes underwater?
What?
Well, we're not going to hurt it, old boy.  I say, love, is Flipper ready to go?
Yeah, poor bastard.
I'll remember that, my Lordship.
No way.
I'm sure you won't.  But you're going to have to wait till we come up.  Then you can film all you want.
Always do.
I know.  But we show it's not closing.
Sharks???
So was Dad.
It's all up to Kathryn.  Amity's fine with me if it's fine with her.
He told me you both did....
He was doing his job....
Nowhere....
We need beer....
Tell Matt he should be here....
I thought artists worked with their subconscious....
They're at the beach....
I like it.  Really....
Do you and Michael ever talk about his work...?  About spending so much time working in the water?
Part of me wanted to go off with him, the rest of me couldn't...I don't know why he wants me....
Spent it all on beer....
I'm hungry, Mom....
Adds flavor....
You check it....
Thank you....
Good.  So will I....
I don't like him chasing around after you...I don't trust him....
I'm pleased.  I really am.  Really....
Trying to write our report....
No.
Why'd you come out here?
I always listen to my feelings....
It could have been an accident....
Boss' day off...Take the wheel....
One time I was flying supplies up the Amazon.  Went down in the jungle....
Good.  I have two left....
You're always taking time off....
My vision is perfect....
Yes I can....
We'll buy you one.  We're having a party....
She'll be all right, partner.. She'll never find it.  We couldn't....
It'll come for the plane.  It's attracted to metal.  The electro- magnetic impulse....
Good news travels fast....
You don't have to say anything, Matt ...I know how you feel....
Oh, boy....
I made them, man....
You didn't stick them on right....
May your sex life be as busy as your shirt....
As the sun slowly sets in the West, we bid a fond farewell to the family of conch....
When I signed on....
We got it together, Jake....
So did I....
What she's got.  Nine knots....
As long as he's been here....
I am...You must know something about him....
I hear he flies a lot of private charters....
Don't be so down, man.  Money's gone...Shark's gone...We're back to conch...We've got it made....
Mom....
It'll work....
If we're real lucky, it'll eat itself....
The big picture...If we can't get him to swallow it, we'll shove it up his....
We need it to eat electronics, man ...Not you.  Get it on me....
I'm the one who wanted to study it....
Here comes the cow ca-ca....
Oh, Jake... 
I'm training to....
I'd have to manage a nookie parlor to do that....
When he has a pillow over his head....
I hope I'm not intruding?
"Welcome to Eureka."
I think you're here all day.
Think I'll lay down with him. Only way I'll get outta here.
Forget it. They got stringent hyg- iene rules. He's long gone in lime.
I don't want excuses, I want that weird-looking stuff called "cash."
You looked like you did?
I never knew about the sailor the- ory, Ross. He might have that one little thing I need in his files?
Alright, she wasn't lying about the van. But it could have been <u>any</u> van? Any little foreign diesel? .. She's <u>blind</u>, Bro .. It's sad .. She's pro- bably lonely, and you're a nice guy to have around .. But you're getting far too far into the element, Brother ..
I'm not in here to apologize, John. I told you what was gonna happen & it's happened? "Good-bye, Princess," & the same night she gets attacked? That's a tough one to swallow, Bro?
You don't really believe this?
I'm asking it.
Don't give me that! <u>Not another</u> <u>word</u>! When you had the Fat Lady in there, and I asked you if she was lying, you looked me right in the eyes and said <u>yes</u>. So as far as I was concerned, <u>she's ly-</u> <u>ing</u>. And if the King of fucking England had walked in & told me different, I wouldn't have bel- ieved him - because <u>you</u> told me ..
I guess by the bed.
Hair on her hand. Plus Jen- nifer had raven black hair.
He <u>hasn't</u> hidden it. He never made a hit this far north before, and he never read a weather forecast .. She's probably fifteen feet from the highway, three feet under snow.
If you're not gonna hear me, Chief ..
Three or four.
And did they?
Fucken noddle's hanging off ..
My pleasure .. Who's Popeye?
I'm afraid I can't give you an ans- wer to that, Mr Goodridge. As I ex- plained to your secretary, we're do- ing a lotta looking, but we're not even sure it's her we're lookin for ..
I was hopin since we spoke that you might have remembered something that would give us an idea where she is?
I see .. Well, she's teaching an- other class at four .. I'd apprec- iate it if you don't detain her ..
When we spoke on the phone, did you know I was blonde?
No. Except he smoked. Like you.
No problem. I'm not in a hurry.
Hamlet. Have you read it?
Well, I'm glad we got the conver- sational side of lunch over with.
Yeah, that'll do .. Is that "Hamlet?"
How d'you know what I'm like?
Coz you hardly said a word since you got here. But you been thinking pretty loud ..
It's not possible right now.
I know about alcohol, John.
Two or three years ago.
Suzanne? Very pretty. She was a semi- professional model. But a policeman's wife she wasn't. So one day, she just packed it and left. And his whole life went straight down the nearest toilet.
I'm here, honey. I'm right here.
Friday night at City Hall. Got a great chance to frighten the fat.
I wouldn't mind another B.E.E.R.
He's not that bad of a guy ..?
His father's the manager, Sir. The kid was up there shooting vermin, and he found the body.
And the egyptian cotton shirt that works with or without the jacket.  Tell me again, how was it left with Cush?
Ugh!
Okay, this is working.
You lost your head, it happens.  I'm so fuckin jazzed!  Listen. I'm going to have to fly to Chicago tomorrow, how 'bout if we meet in the Dallas airport and we all fly into New York together for the draft?
Everything's on the fucking run! Everything --
-- stop --
There is something missing here.
Listen to me, it's over.
I'm not trying to make history. _ 67.
I see what you're saying.
"Something in the way.  Yeah."
Just be friendly and say "no comment."
My son... my mind...
We are?
Well, I'm happy for you.
We will be fine!
Sure.
Mission... statement...
No, I do.  I feel like Clarence Thomas.  I'm like... harrassing you... right now.
Good evening.
Yeah, what happened there.
I'm relieved you said that.
Oh good.
Yeah -- guess I got revved up at the idea of an evening among adults -- no offense buster.  You meet Chad the nanny?
Oh hell yes.
Look, just in case this weekend becomes next month and next month becomes... whatever...  Don't make a joke of your life. Go back and read what you wrote. You're better than the rest of them, better than the Bob Sugars, and don't forget it.
Well -- I'm not the guy who's going to run.  I stick.
I know.  I watched it.  I sort of know it by heart.
Oh please.  My need to make the best of things, and your need to be what, "responsible"... if one of us doesn't say something now we might lose ten years being polite about it. Why don't we call this next road trip what it is.  A nice long break.
Dotty -- this is not "guy.". This is a "syndrome."  It's called Early Midlife, About-To-Marry, Hanging Onto The-Bottom-Rung Dear- God-Don't-Let-Me-Be-Alone, I'll- Call-My-Newly Long-suffering- Assistant-Without Medical-For- Company Syndrome.  And if, knowing all that, you still allow him to come over, more power to you.
It's only a half-hour show, Rod.
Okay.
Congratulations.  You're still my agent.
You feel bad you tested positive? Quit doing blow!  You feel bad about your baby girl? Why did you leave the mother?
Well, boo-fucking-hoo.
Another drink please.
Great word.  Towel?
Rod, I say this with great respect, but those players you mentioned are marquee players and --
You.
Rod, I'm not a rascist.  I'm telling you to be the best version of you, to get back to the guy who first started playing this game. Way back when you were a kid.  It wasn't just about the money, was it?
Oh, we gonna be friends now?
Tell me, because it's been a month, and she's about to take another job in San Diego.
But I sure don't like that she's leaving.
Well, friends can tell each other anything, right? If we have our "friends" hats on --
Airight.  Here's why you don't have your ten million dollars yet. You are a paycheck player.  You play with your head.  Not your heart.  In your personal life?  Heart. But when you get on the field --  _ 113.
Tell me, and then you can sleep.
Damn right, and you can start by taking Rod's poster and putting it where people can see it!
And say what?  "Please remove your dick from my ass?!"
"Stay calm?"  I'm freakin...
I came here to let you go. _ 27.
Hi Ray.
Yeah I know.  I did.
That's why they cheer, you know. The white man sending the black man into battle...
He's smart, Dr. Grant. And he knows so much about dinosaurs.
From what I understand, it's pretty much whatever we want.
Twenty, twenty-fire pounds. I've been swimming at the Y.
People change.
Its not about him. It's Eric. He's alone out here somewhere. Our baby is all alone.
Well damn it. I don't speak ill of the dead. What I'm trying to say is, its was just a crazy accident. The exact same thing could have happened if he was with me. You can't go beating yourself up about it.
You mean it?
How low?
What about Eric?
I didn't know, there were two islands.
Thirty-thousand, I think. Closer to the top.
It won't hold!
Obviously a superpredator.  Suchimimus. that snout.
Alan, I want to tell you that I'm so sorry about the...
He's three. Why don't you wait till he's a little older?
It was never easy, but before Jurassic Park, you could find money. Somewhere. Now fossils are out. Everyone wants to see a real live dinosaur.
You'd be surprised what people can do when they have too.
Back then, they hadn't tried to eat me.
Any weapons, radios?
The important thing is we both made it. That's something we have in common.
I stayed pretty close to the compound, Figured if anyone came to look for me, that's where they'd start.
Are you sure?
Well sir, I am a great admirer of yours, and I have an extremely interesting proposition to discuss. Would you let my wife and I take you to have dinner tonight? Our treat.
No, no, see Dr. Grant, you're the best. You've seen these animals in the flesh. No one else has come close to you.
I have never been on this island!
That cheap aftershave I send you every Christmas, you actually wear it.  I'm touched.  Sit down, sit down, what brings you to Mombassa?
Just a little bit too much, I think.
You broke that idiot's jaw for no reason other than your boredom.  Tell the truth, Roland.  Aren't you even interested in knowing this expedition's quarry?
Like if you shoot yourself in the foot?  Wouldn't matter.  You'd be dead  before you realized you'd accidentally pulled the trigger.
Because I didn't know!  I don't have the faintest idea what they're doing here.
It's the lawyers.  The lawyers are finally killing me.
Isla Nublar was just a showroom, Ian, something for the tourists, Site B was the factory floor.  We built it first, on Isla Sorna, eight-some miles from Nublar.
Ian, you are my last chance to give something of real value to the world. I can't walk so far and leave no footprints; die and leave nothing with my name on it.  I will not  be known only for my failures.  And you will not allow yourself to go down in history as a lunatic.  You're too smart.  You'e too proud.  Dr. Malcolm.  Please.  This is a chance at redemption.  For both of us. There's no time to equivocate, we must seize it now, before --
That doesn't say a thing about T-rex, they could have been rogues.  Robert Burke certainly thinks they were.
My vacation is over in a week.
Which one?
That was about a year ago.
Out of the question.  You'd miss the gymnastics trials.  You've been training for that for a year.
Where does it say that?
I'm fine, I'm fine, I was scared, I thought you, are you okay?!
Come on!
You heard his, Dieter.  Find a new spot.  And remember, we're after herbivores only -- no unnecessary risks.
I hadn't planned on bringing carnivores back because of the liability risk, but I only thought of adults, it never occurred to me --  You are a billion dollar idea, my little f-
You've broken its leg!
Possible.
Why?
It's just fed.  It won't attack unless it's threatened.  Don't move.
I didn't tell anything, I told the truth.
Piss.
You're going too?
She's nuts.
We're sure as hell not going back out there"
It'll hold!
Why did you come here?
But why?
What?!
Maybe.  Maybe not.
You think this is all a joke?
I believe in him.
You're sure we have to?
I will not do it.  You'll have to get somebody else, because I will not.
Theoretically, yeah , but we've never shut down the whole system.  It may not come back at all.
Uh - - about two million.
Yeah, again, in  theory, but - -
'Bout thirty seconds.
Anybody at all.  Feel free to speak up.
Oh, you know, if it's alright, I'd like to stay with Dr. Harding and finish with the trike.  Is that okay?
That's pharmacological.  From local plant life.
They'll all be fine.  Who better to get the children through Jurassic Park than a dinosaur expert?
But you can't think through this one.  You have to feel it.
They died together?
Yes.  Good shape, too.  Five, six feet high.  I'm guessing nine feet long.  Look at the - -
Oh, Ellie, look.  They're noisy, they're messy, they're sticky, they're expensive.
What kind of park is it?
- - the undigested state of the berries because it's - -
- - barfs them up - -
No, no, no!
Okay.
We'll discuss sexism in survival situations when I get back.  You just take me through this step by step.  I'm on channel two.
I can see the shed from here!  We can make it if we run!
Hola, bienvenido
Yeah.
Triceratops was a constant browser, and constant browsers would be constantly sick.
No.
This is impossible.  How am I going...I can't make it. This is...it's about fifty feet.
Nope.
Why?
You want to talk about this?
We gotta do something.
John Hammond.  And I am delighted to finally meet you in person Dr Grant.
The brachiosaur?  Thirty.
Alan Grant.  Tell me, what kind of metabolism do they have?  What's their growth rate?  rate of growth.
Let's get you out.
It's safe.
Go  that's the way we're going to go.  What do you say?
All night.
Yes.
I'm sorry about your financial problems.  I really am. But they are your problems.
Excellent.
Turn it off, Lex!  Turn it off!
Why did you do this?
That was great!
Do you think they like the fact that tourism has dropped ninety-eight percent in the last ten years?
Great.
I really think we should go back...
I'm not sure I'd call them murder exactly. More like a couple of bar fights that got out of hand.
Fuck you.
What?
That's right. Wasn't on any of the maps... we could barely see it through the underbrush. Place must've been abandoned for twenty years.
Take it easy, Ruby...	it's all right.  Now, try to think clearly... don't you mean _Jason's_ hand... don't you mean he grabbed a scalpel and slashed Doctor Layton's throat?
Because everyone knows he's guilty...
I don't know if anything's going to work in this case. Therefore, we have to try everything.
Great. Battling head doctors. We'll confuse the jury enough to create a reasonable doubt. Hung jury.
There's a pizza place over on Market.
Yeah, what is it?
Ten CC's of this shit and you won't be dreaming about anything.
Yes -- that's us.
Yes -- we do.
You were his friend.  One link is all they need.
-- Small.
I don't know what you could have read.
I'll commit that to memory.
Say what you like -- no one pays the least attention.
Not today, Burgel.  Send one of your memos, write up one of your communiques, but for God's sake don't bother me today.
You're just doing your job.
I know.
Yes.
You won't have any trouble finding it.
He was murdered.
I have no right to be, I know.  My experience with real life  is practically nil.
People must think the same of me -- a quiet, dependable person.
I've heard of it happening.
-- Listen to me --
Yes.  Since he came to the office, almost three years ago, we've been quite good friends.  How was Eduard ...
-- Should you happen upon anything that might be relevant.
I can't make a simple statement without him taking issue with it
Close only by virtue of antithesis.
-- Oh, yes, it's mad.
Oh, Burgel!  Gabriela was having an affair with Eduard.  They were both members of <u>this group</u>.  If any crime's been discovered and people are paying for it, I'd look to <u>yourselves</u>!
It only amuses me in that it gives me an insight into the ludicrous bungling that in some circumstances may decide the life of a human being.
I had the grandest of financial plots in mind, the most malevolent of personal motives, conspiracy theories extending to every ... authority I could see.  And I find you.  A body snatcher.
Lying in the gutter where they belong.
What have you done with Gabriela Rossmann?
Of course not.  Only by a Director of the firm.  Who'd want to let in all kinds of riff-raff off the streets?
These laws have been with us for centuries -- how can you doubt them?
Oskar.
She went to the roof to sunbathe one lunch hour -- we watched her changing.
Amerika for us!
Kong is a myth, nothing but a native superstition, Miss Darrow. All we're going to find on that island are some primitive people in grass skirts. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm trying to reduce my handicap.
To be quite honest, Mr Denham ... I find the whole idea to be quite reprehensible.
Father ... Father!
You - calling me a thief? Well, that's great, coming from a glorified grave robber! You break into the tomb of some dead Egyptian - the poor guy's happily enjoying the afterlife when suddenly his shit gets stolen by a bunch of light fingered limeys!
There's nothing fast enough to catch that. Forget it. It's over.
I'm not sailing with this thing on board!
We need those co-ordinates -someone's gotta get back there and jot the rest of it down
We should never have come! I pay you good money, only to have my life endangered. You'll be hearing from my lawyer!
They' re dead.
Yeah, I saw her ... she was carried into the jungle by ... an animal.
What?
Arlyn, he just wanted to ask some questions -- something you could help us about.
Please, if he sees you, he won't come!
What about him? Yes.
She was with you after she left Frank.
And Cannes was quite fun, quite; and we played baccarat and chemindefer and there was a nice little Italian marquis quite enthusiastic for me -- but a young man can be so silly --
Please --
Yes?
I'd just be guessing.
Maybe this wasn't just a trick. Maybe you're in danger of real love, real involve --
We don't want to just lock him up; we want a conviction, we wanted him to do something more.
Yes.
I'm an investigator. I'd like to ask you some questions about Tom Grunemann.
Will you let me ask you some questions?
How would I remember?
-- OK --
-- OK?
Maybe, if you tell me the things you haven't.
It was Jane McKenna who sent you the dumper.
You said you wanted these.
Try some other ways. 
I don't get you.
No.
Yeah.
Don't touch anything.
Right back at the start, right?
No. I was going to come up. I wanted to ask you to marry me. 
I don't think so.
They don't scare me any more.
It's where it doesn't get me. I've got nothing left that connects to anything.
Yeah.
No. No mistake Pete. It doesn't prove who it was -- but proves it wasn't Tom.
Someone's been doing all these things.
Pete, I've got a chance to buy Jane McKenna's black book.
It's not so bad.
It's in the report.
I've just got a few --
I think she's trying that.
Are you with plant security, Sergeant?
You knew the subject Thomas Grunemann. How well?
Examine this letter please.  We recovered that from the shredder -- the plant disposal and incinerator system. Grunemann apparently typed it Friday, before he left, decided not to send it, tossed it away. We've already contacted the New York Police; they think they know the girl in question.
I believed her: the Dumper was not Tom Grunemann.
I looked it up.
Show...
On earth.
I'll call Thelma and remind her, okay?  Don't worry.
I'm sorry, pal, but I had a meeting and--
Mom, I mean dad?
Can I be excused?  I'm not hungry.
That's terrific.  That's really terrific, but I notice I'm the one that's cleaning up this--  Oh, crap, I'll have to do this one over.
Some of the brown stuff is still there.
No!
Tough shit.  You're stuck with me.
Yeah?
Oh...
I love you...
Sure.  Lots of times.
It's my name too.
Sure.
Boy, I bet you if mommy ever saw this she'd remarried you.
Yeah, there was apple juice.
Uh, uh.  There was no such a thing as Burger King.
Why does he decide?
Like a principal?
I don't understand, daddy.
Will you come and say good-night to me every night?
Six years.
Because my son is here.  And his father is here.  As a mother, I don't want my child to be separated from his father.
How long do you plan to live in New York, Mrs. Kramer?
Objection!
Yes.
No.
No.
No.
Yes.
You can't tell it from a distance, Ted.
You have?
Such as?
Joanna, what the hell is--
What?
Oh, God...Oh, my God...
No more waiting in Coffee Shops ...I promise.
Beautiful.
Jim, I appreciate what you're saying.  I mean it, but I really think Joanna's coming back.
Yes, what?
Oh, for God's sake, Kramer. You have got to be the world's most naive human being.  Murray has gone in and changed every single ad you've done on the entire Fire and Ice campaign. Every layout...Every idea...Every single thing, right down the line.
Kramer, I'm sorry.  All I was trying to do was--
Right.
Kramer--
I'm going to take it.
Walk him over to Bethesda Fountain, buy him an ice.  It'll kill twenty minutes.
First, there's no such thing as an open and shut case. Especially where custody is involved.  Got it?
Six.
The judge went for motherhood straight down the line.
I can't tell you how sorry I am.
Six years.  Ever since Ted and Joanna moved into the building.
How the hell are you going to do that?
Ten.
I understand.
Look,  I know this isn't gonna make any sense, okay?  I mean forget the logic part...But I keep thinking if Charley really loved me, he wouldn't have let me divorce him.
Uh, huh...Yeah...
Maybe.  I said maybe.  What I mean is, ah...I don't think it'll really work out, but Charley seems to want it, so...
Don't play innocent with me, Thelma.  You know perfectly well what's going on.
Ha!  You tell me.
Yes, Holiness.
Kham, Holiness.
I know.
And you have horses? You love horses.
Here. We'll collect them.
The Sera monks have surrendered?
All?
Yes. Most of the Chamdo region is now in Chinese hands. There is a report from Chamdo which makes quite clear that, unless some settlement can soon be reached, Communist troops will soon be marching on Lhasa.
I am afraid.
We do not know.
I accept it. What is suffering?
You could buy them.
What do you think?
No. This war is almost over.
I do not know, Holiness.
When it is time.
Ask the Chinese mission to leave our country. Immediately.
I shall send a letter to America, to the President, informing him of our problem.
Good day.
But you will always be here?
You decide.
Soft. Nice. I have a good friend back in Lhasa.
Pretend.
I would not know. Maybe.
The Chinese.
But, I have no experience.
No, Holiness.
Eliminate you.
I did not know him before I married him. I loved his brother, but then, I married his brother, too. He is dead now.
My department doesn't have any record of that, Mrs. Bickerman.
You're to wait right here until the police show, you're under full house arrest.
I'll need any and all topographic studies.
Mr. Cyr!
They come on land and they're brazen.  They're also attracted to noise, you can see I make a lot of it.
And you like me.
What I'm saying is <u>if</u> it's a crocodile that cut a man in half he would have to be over twenty feet which would make him well over a hundred years old, it would be unthinkable to destroy him.
No thank you, but maybe later you can chew the bark off my big fat log.
Yup.
I used to have this recurring nightmare that I was headless.
Obviously some asshole in Hong Kong flushed him down a toilet.
It came from across the lake.
He didn't eat the kid cause he'd just swallowed a bear.
Then do it!!
I don't know!
Bastard bit my chopper.
Right.
You ready on shore?
Thank you, Jack.
Yeah and every time we think there's no more danger--
Women's intuition.  Are there anymore?
Are you sure?
Nothing's real.
No.
Could we have intercourse?
Yes, it <u>did</u> seem prehistoric but I'm sure he just carried the thing for luck.  Not that it <u>worked</u>, obviously.  It probably somehow got lodged into his body.
I <u>told</u> you.
How would <u>you</u> know, what--
Who?
There <u>have</u> been Northern sightings. But not <u>this</u> North.
I didn't fly up here to roast marshmallows--
That's probably good.
Just gotta pull it a little tighter.
Keep it dry.  No swimming.
Maybe.  I've always <u>read</u> about what's happened.  I've never... I know it sounds silly but, it's nice to be someplace <u>while</u> something is actually... y'know... happening.
You're mushing it a little around the--
<u>No</u>.  I keep getting hit with heads!
You calm down!
Okay.
He <u>has</u> been going after everything. It <u>could</u> work.  But this is not a happy cow.
He's floating.  Take it home.
I don't care.  Hank.  End it.
He heeds a tourniquet.
But we do.  Hey, we'll always have Maine.
Worth a try.  We don't wanna be alone forever, do we?
Good thinking.
Let's go.
White perch.
We shouldn't even really be doing this.
<u>You</u> <u>gotta</u> <u>be</u> <u>kidding</u>.
Where is he?!
Well.  At wakes.
Yes.
I got nothing against--
Thank you, it's so rewarding to imagine my tax dollar finding its way to you, you Fucker. 
It's to make you <u>understand</u> him, with understanding comes tolerance. Too bad they don't put proverbs in Twinkies, my load would be lighter.
I asked you to be nice to him.
I think.  My hair.  Where's Hector?!  Where is he?
It's ten after nine.
I'm sure it's nothing, but you're a paleontologist, this is what we do, I--
It has nothing to do with--
Kevin told me you were upset.
It started <u>before</u> you, Kelly, I never would've--
Stay cool. Just remember to call him "God."
Thanks, Ardelia.
Pleading with a crazy man, with come all over my face.
Why does she keep repeating the name?
The worst part - the thing that's making me crazy - is that Bill is right in front of me. Only I can't see him...  Lecter said, everything I need to catch him is right here, in these pages...
Agent Mapp! Thank you!
Lecter has already named Buffalo Bill.
Sir, doesn't this "William Rubin" strike you as - I don't know - kind of vague?
Starling -
Not yet.
What he does with them - takes privacy... Time, tools... He's in his 30's or 40's - he's got real physical strength, but combined with an older man's self-control. He's cautious, precise, never impulsive... This won't end in suicide, like they often do.
You haven't said a word today about that garage. Or what I found there.
You knew. You knew from the start that Lecter held the key to this... But you weren't up front with me. You sent me in to him naked.
It matters, Mr. Crawford... Other cops know who you are. They look at you to see how to act... It matters.
You heard them. I don't have that authority anymore.
But not from this angle. Not thinking he knew her. You've got to send me!
Starling, we know who he is! And where he is. We're on our way now.
Stacy, did Fredrica ever mention a man named Jamie Gumb? Or John Grant?  Do you think she could've had a friend you didn't know about?
Sometimes you do.
May I see your credentials?
Do you know why he's called Buffalo Bill? Tell me. The newspapers won't say.
And you'd hate to think you were common. My, wouldn't that sting! Well you're far from common, Officer Starling. All you have is the fear of it.  Now please excuse me. Good day.
Why? Do you know something about him?
If you didn't kill him, then who did?
Wouldn't it have been easier to just leave him for the police to find?
Scared, at first. Then - exhilarated.
Because you weren't wasting my time.
I don't know. Next time I'll have to check.
Buffalo Bill...?  Bill killed him, all those years ago...? That's impossible.
How long did you live there?
Clarice... you're hardly in a position to accuse me of lying.
I've studied the case file, have you...? Everything you need to find him is right in these pages. Whatever his name is.
No! That's incidental.
Anger, social resentment, sexual frus-
What was it?
Dr. Lecter -
It may be that - I could confer with my colleagues on this. And get back to you.
The Latin name comes from two rivers in Hell. Your man - he drops these girls into rivers, every time. Didn't I read that?
Can we rest soon?
Anyone lookin' to pick up our trail, would see it as a sign of our passing...
I'm sorry.
In London those radical ideas could land you in Newgate prison.  Why were those people living in this defenseless place...?
Why, I am looking at you, Miss.
Because what I am interested in is right here...
No. I will find you.
I don't know. Whatever happens you stay with your father. You stay among the officers.
Maybe...
Alice?
I have nothing to go back for.
"Justice"?  If that's "justice"..., then the sooner French guns blow the English army out of America, the better it will be for these people.
And by sea!
"Some"?
I am sorry, Duncan...
You are defending him because you've become infatuated with him.
What are they doing to Duncan? Duncan!
He is Huron and nothing else.  Why would he want to murder the girl?
Dark haired...
Came across the war party, tracked 'em.
Only chance we got is...  ... to get more distance on 'em and go to ground!
This is it, as far as we can go... If we're lucky, they'll be figurin' we can't have come this way and must've beached our canoes and headed cross land. If we're very lucky, they'll figure we went over the falls.
Tradin' your skins in Castleton?
You're not coming with us?
Our father, Montcalm, is greater than the Yengeese in the arts of war. The Huron do not fear English anger.
No.  Huron serve no one. The French father believes he fooled Magua because he is so proud of his cleverness, he is blind. But it is the Huron path that Magua walks down, not the French one... Now, Les Francais, also, fear Huron. That is good. When the Huron is strong from their fear, we will make the terms of trade with Les Francais. And we will trade as the white man trades. Take land from the Abnakes; fur from the Osage, Sauk & Fox. And make the Huron great. Over other tribes. No less than the whites, as strong as the whites.
The red man put down the bow, picked up the fire stick and became the best warrior in the forest. Yes. It is the only way.
It was a war party. It means they're on the attack up and down the frontier.
What did you see, Major?
Easy for you to suppose. While it is their women and children, not yours, alone in their farms!
Sir!  Upon the center, wheel to the left- about!  March!  Rear ranks, proper distance!  Front ranks, take your distance! March!  Halt!  Make ready! 
I understand. This is not good place to stop.  Two leagues from here. No water 'til then.  That where we stop. Better place.
Wampum?
Yengeese Major give all property to Magua.  Magua give Yengeese Major much wampum, many gifts, maybe three, four oxen.
For Munro children?
Granted, Monsieur.
Well, I'll be on the golf course in the morning.  Then, if I don't have any babies to deliver--
These observers were doing something. A test...I think they sank that ship on purpose to cover up their mistakes.
I'm not a doctor.
Danakil man?...one of our ancestors.  Named for the Danakil Alps in Ethiopia.
He don't need a readout, man, he needs help!
The good doctor hasn't showed yet.
He did.
No.
No!
Just get in yours!
Why?  You going to give me hard time like the others?
Maybe you're more one of us than you think...sir.
Our only chance is to lure it to the Swamp and flush it like we did the other.
You're only twenty-five tons off quota.  Barring an unforeseen problem you should reach it easily on the last day.  It's just a day off.  You don't have to take it, I just thought it might help.
Uh..Excuse me sir, it's the air recirculating system, sir...
...I'd really have to show it to you.
And it killed Bo?
Don't thank me, yet, but it is important to know where you're going and who your friends are... 'Know what I mean?
It shouldn't be a long delay.
Fuck the suits, it's the people monitoring them.  It Doc had been there like he's supposed to it never would've happened!
The man is unbelievable... I say, leave him in there.
Aw, loosen up, Bowman...  Hey, Willie, I got one served up for you.
Itches like hell.
It's Hazy...It's got him! Stay here and don't let him out.  I'm going to get the Doc.
This is what I wear at the beach, goddamnit.
What?  That?...I've done this one before.  You hungry?  I'm hungry.
It's had a meal.
No fuckin' lie...
Let's hope it holds.
Honey, the company don't give a flying fuck about "whys," they just look at the numbers and the contract says if we miss our quota they only got to pay us half-pay for the entire month.
The air's stopped.
Don't fuckin' worry, I ain't.
Your pocket?
Stop fucking around, Tom, and think. What are we going to do?
I would rather put my money on a three-legged rocking horse. The odds are a hundred to one for a good reason, BACON . . . it won't win. So where is Ed with all the bright ideas?
I'll meet you in the van when you have finished with handsome there.
Apart from those shotguns.
Where're the others?
Now, stop fucking around. The others, the old ones?
There were two old guns there; where are they?
Yeah, Bazza, what?
No mortgage, no debts; lock, stock, the sodding lot . . . don't worry, I got it under control.
It's a fucking stately home, of course there'll be something there.
Can I help?
Yeah, it's all there, to the pound.
It looks like t, but who knows? The opportunity was there. In my experience it is best to take the opportunity if it is there.
I'll have it for Mr Harry in a few days. I have been busy, and I am nearly there.
Very fucking funny. Where's what I want?
Sure is.
This is dangerous shit, Dean; we don't even know who lives in there.
Er well, yes we do.
Well enough. I have been buying gear off one of them for a couple of years.
What do you mean, never? Well what have they got it for, then?
No.
I didn't touch him, he just passed out.
What the fuck is going on?
Out the back.
Well we have got about a hundred thousand pretty pieces of paper with the Queen on it. Will that do?
It's either that, my old boy's place, and we lose a digit daily. I am going to call him.
He said he thinks we have paid him, and he wants to talk about those guns . . . now.
I'll only be a minute.
We paid seven hundred quid for those guns. They could hardly trace them to you, could they?
I am not interested in what you would rather; I want to keep going. I am also offering you the money, so we don't have to turn them over because you can borrow.
I like your bar.
You know it doesn't include the amp.
Tom, you're all heart.
We need fertilizer, Winston.
So?
You'll find out when I get you home. Thanks, Sam.
So?
They're not going to jail.
No, sir--
I'm sorry, sir.
I am, sir.
It's their country. This is one of the best deals they offer.
Outside it's--it's such a mess--it's--
No, sir. Not at all.
Yes, sir.
From back in Houston. We both come up on Fifth Street.
He'll live.
Thank you, Sergeant Major.
If I had I wouldn't have gone in.
That badge--
Skull was intact, no soft tissue left--not much to go on.
He swore by it.  What?
You feeling bad for Jimmy? Have him tell you the size of the mordida they took out of his hide when he run a place on the other side. Those old boys in Ciudad Leon--
You're fired. You're outta the department.
You kind of bought yourself a pig in a poke, didn't you, Sam? All that time we were first seeing each other you didn't know I was tightly wound--
So that's him--
Otis went on like you were that guy who won the Gulf War. Colin whatsit.
So they stayed in Florida?
They fought against the Indians?
You know who I am?
No sports if I don't keep a B average, no TV on school nights, no PDA's--
I finished that. I'm just messing around.
You wouldn't?
Your government always been pretty happy to have that line. The question's just been where to draw it
I think it's beyond what you'd call dating.
Priscilla says they think any woman over 30 who isn't married must be a lesbian. She figures they'll be so relieved I'm a man--
If I stayed out past ten with the guys she'd go into her Madame Butterfly routine--
Seriously, I think we should get married.
--but just as a kind of safety tip.
Old Sam stood for somethin', you know? The day that man died they broke the goddamn mold.
Appreciate it, sir.
We have an enlisted man's club at the post.
That's right.
Aqui! [Here!]
Quien es? [Who is it?]
We have a daughter.
Donde vamos? [Where are we going?]
Senora, anything it costs, I can work--
King wasn't Mexican, Fenton--
--but Buddy Deeds was my salvation.
We're already renting cells to the Feds for their overflow--
--Santiago.
Sam! Hey podner! You caught me playing hooky--
Sounds great. Where do I sign up?
You recall if Charley Wade was a Mason?
I told the story enough times--hell, we were just in the car, he was stewing about the fight with Buddy while we drove over to Roderick Bledsoe's--
No. I think his widow's still in their place in Darktown, though.  You think it's Charley Wade, huh?
Word gets out who that body was, people are gonna think Buddy done it.
The Perdido thing?
Steve?
All my mother does is work. That's how you get to be Spanish.
No. I was wondering if you'd like to take a trip down south with us. Maybe see where you grew up--
Oh, come on--you must be curious how it's changed. Amado is into this big Tejano roots thing and I've never been further than Ciudad Leon--
He was killed.
I was too busy.
You ever play one of these?
I won't say nothing bad about the man, but you can ask away.
Not if I can help it.
Wasn't legal to sell liquor in a glass back then unless you was a club, see. Roderick used to say, "Buy yourself a drink, you get a free membership." But Sheriff Wade, he could shut you down anytime.
Okay? He's not here?
He's going to wish he was dead.
I'd like to see them spend a day pulling 14-year-olds off of each other--I should get combat pay--
And that was the last time you saw him?
Yeah?
Yeah. I had uhm--school business.
How much you got left?
You stop growing that loco weed at your place, you'd see a lot more daylight.
Out in the fresh air, nice gringo lady making you pies--who's gonna sit back in a little jail cell all day? Sheriff Buddy, man. Como el no hay dos. And after that cabron Charley Wade--
Somebody called--something about an electronics store.
I don't know. It just feels good. Always did.
I've felt that way, yeah.
She'll figure it out sooner or later. I don't have to ask permission anymore, if that's what you mean.
If I met you for the first time today, I'd still want to be with you.
Yeah.
I been working on a few things.
You'd do a good job.
You sell much out here?
Hell of a spot to put a business.
So when did Buddy leave?
No--
Who is he?
How?
Nope.
doorway) And who's that?
A Nix specialty?
Trickery and divinity.  Yeah, he says that all the time.
I told you --
I know him.  I saw him.
He won't.
What do you mean, "all of us?"
About?
What about death?
Yes...
Please... Butterfield... I wasn't there.  Ask Pimm.
Yes.
You don't?
I don't exactly know. Philip doesn't like to talk about the past.
You haven't seen anything yet.
Yes... I'm here.  And no.  I don't know the name.
I didn't leave.  I was just digging around.
Some or it.
Nothing?
I'm here, Harry.
Yeah.  Remember Quaid?
--vanished.
Are you saying that sometimes the miracles are real?
I heard he was the best.
Fuck you.
It's one in the afternoon.
I need to speak to you, Mr. D'Amour.  About last night.
We've never met.
I'm here to offer you a job.
I don't think the dead much care.
Yes.  It's regrettable
What for?  You need to stay busy?
Why people die?  Give it up, D'Amour.  Go home.
Yes.
I tried to pay you off.
I won't say anything.
Yeah.  You could say that.
I know all the kids coming up. Got to stay ahead of the game. But I don't know you.
What a tragedy.  It was just a matter of time, of course, but it's not good for the business.
Why?  So you can fuck my wife?
You didn't try hard enough.
No!
You want to be like that, Swann? Mud and shit?
Not true.
You'll do it?
Philosophy.
Who do I have to fuck to get off this planet?
Hi. Did you have a nice swim?
No way.
It's Charlotte.
Thanks for getting me back in one piece.
I think he kind of liked me...Is that so hard to imagine?
No, for a candlelight dinner, yes, for her show.
You'll figure it out. I'm not worried about you. Keep writing.
We established that we have no communication.
We used to have fun, she used to like to go to places with me for my movies and we would laugh at all the weirdos, but now she's tired of it all. She never wants to leave the kids, she doesn't need me, and they don't need me, I feel like I'm in the way. It gets complicated when you have kids... that changes everything.
I know, but that's what you like about me.
Because that would be too easy.
How old is she?
No, we'll find something around here.
That lunch was the worst, huh.
Tomorrow.
That's what you said the other night.
I'll miss you.
Oh?
Hello, darling.
That sounds great  can you hold on...  What Zoe?
Is this a bad time?
It's Lydia, your wife.
That's ok.
Tomorrow.
One moment, please.
Hello, can I have room 5601.
What?
Why do you have to defend her?
Good...I'm tired.
Ok. Maybe I'll walk down with you.
What?
I got some hair stuff.
I don't know.
Ok, I will... later.
Are you sure you have to go?
Sure.
Have you met Charlotte? My wife.
Says she can get me in to see this killer.
I don't know.  In a way, I'm glad it all happened.
I found the pentacle.
Yes.  It's exactly...
What time did you make it for?
And on the day of the murders, his state of mind?
Tell the jury how many people work in that office with you and Mr. Viznick.
Of course not.  They put him through severe mental stress.  Causing this aneurysm.
I certainly hope you're not lending any credence to this.
Father, I have nowhere else to stay.
You ready?
You know how I feel.  The world is random.  The only certainty I believe in is death.
Don't you get it?  They had their 2,000 years.  Now it's our turn.
Don't worry...about the transformation, Maya.
Um hm.  That's right, Maya.
Would you like to rest, Miette?  You must be exhausted.
How many weeks are you honey/
...as a narcissist, he couldn't blame himself.  He created the voices after the fact.
An exorcism was just held for Birdson. It failed.  Disastrously.  Which means there's still a demonic spirit present in his body.  I was wondering, perhaps you'd like to go meet Henry.  He's pretty amazing.
On television, you seemed so sure of yourself.  If you're really that confident, you'd be willing to let someone prove you wrong?
I cranked it all the way up.  Nothing but hum.
There's no reason why you should.  This has been planned from your birth. You fit all the criteria that we know of.  Never baptized, born of incest, devoid of faith...
What?
Whish the circumstances were different.
We'll see Father Frank in the morning. There's nothing to be done until then.
Get out of here.
Well, long-term exposure to things like this tends to give you a sort of clinical understanding of the subject. After awhile, you begin to make friends with it, so to speak.
Mike.  Oh, the christening.  I meant to call...
Sure thing.  Look, I've got enough, between your preliminary statements and all the witness accounts.  You can go home.  Gimme til morning.  Find out who he is. Until then, don't sweat it, huh?  Just your random bad cheese trying to hole you.
Yeah, murder-suicide.
Mother killed the father, then killed herself.  Crime of passion.
I'm lucky I found it.  Someone put your box of dresses under a pile of rags in the garbage.
Sure.  In between all the other things I have to do.
Tonight, don't worry about yesterday's game, the recruiters, or anything else. I just want you to enjoy being beautiful. Will you do that?
Don't curse.
You're the one always turning your nose up at me.
I don't remember that.
That's ridiculous.
You had your coaches and your father for that stuff.  It never mattered one way or the other if I went to your games.
She's alright.
I thought Sidra's ankle was okay for next game.
Sort of.
Then I'll get you some punch.
Kyra, this is Monica.  She, uh...
Why not?
Baby, don't talk like that.  Your rehab's going well.  You'll be back before you know it.
To do what you love.
No.
Found?  I'm not some charity case.
He's in college?
Oh, great.
Too many times.
You lost your head.
The coach from USC is going to be at the championship.
Dad.  What are you doing here?
Besides.  I've been starting point the last two years.  Ain't no way some dumb- ass freshman is taking my spot.
Didn't have to try very hard.
No buts.  Took a lot of heart to take that charge.
But that was a dumb-ass pass to Toni. Ten seconds left, you run out the clock.
Just like that?
Uh huh.
He works at a bank.
I guess, you know, we play ball and we ride to school together.  And if you get mad at me, I gotta give you flowers.
Kay.
For how long?
Some note Shawnee Easton told me to give to you.
Yeah, an honest tramp-ass ho.  But I guess you'll stick your dick in anything.
Who's Spalding?
I'm warning you, don't tempt me.
With a jacked-up attitude.
Hey.
What?
I don't have it easy like you, alright. There's no red carpet laid out for me.
Who cares if you're never known as the first girl in the NBA.  You'll get more play behind Quincy McCall's woman anyway.
She understands.
Quincy...
What's up?
What the hell's going on?
I never asked you to choose.
I don't think so.
Damnitt, Monica.  This ain't about us anymore, it's about me.
I was.  I see your peach fuzz finally grew in.
No, it looks good.  I mean, it's cool.
We won the championship.
Kiss my ass.
What do you mean?
No.
Thanks.
Getting there.
Because I'm kinda feeling that way, too.
That a nice way of saying I rode the bench?
Seems like I needed a ball when I was trying to be like my pops...or trying to be better than him.  Now, I kinda think I need to try something else.
Maybe go back to school.
Why do you keep asking me that?
We need to talk.
Then why are you so upset?
So, if I win it's because deep down you know you're about to make the biggest mistake of your life, and deep down your want me to stop you.
Hey.
What?  Oh, and, uh, don't say "shit."
Just you and Quincy, baby.  I got a meeting.
Business folks.
Nona, don't start bitching.  I got maybe two years left to play.  I'm just trying to put some things together for us.
I came second to the NBA.  I'm not about to come second to this bullshit scouting job.
No, you said I should get my degree.  I like my "bullshit" job, okay, and it's gonna lead to a spot in the front office. Til then, don't worry, there's just enough savings to keep your ass in Gucci and gold.
Happy.  And he won't want to see you.
We still have to go?
Okay.
Yup.
Mom, we can't let something like this mess up the family.
This is just about money, you know that.
"Can't" should never be in a man's vocabulary.
You know, people.
I want this thing to go to court, but my lawyer's telling me to settle.
A case like this could hang around for months and I'm up for this player relations job with the "Clips."  This gets out, false or not, no one'll touch me.
We haven't exactly been living the fairy- tale life the past few years.  Something like this happens, it either brings a family closer or pushes them further apart.  We'll just have to see how it plays out.  I'm giving her some space, couple days...
Your door was unlocked.
Look, I ain't saying it was right, but sometimes things happen.
Don't remember that being my fault. Seems like you divorced me same time as your mom.
I can see that.  I know things look pretty bleak right now, but you can't get down on yourself.
I'm fuckin' hammered, Burt.
In my sleep, Burt.
No, no, no. I'm fine. It's small, I wanna keep going --
Shut it.  Shut yer fuckin' mouth.
It's a helluva disease.
It's me.  Claudia.  It's me.
Don't yell, honey.  Please don't go crazy --
I'm sorry, I had to get dressed.
Ok. For one thing, we're gonna need to turn that music down so we can talk, ok?
You got the TV on too, keep those on at that same time usually?
You don't have a boyfriend?
Claudia: Why don't you let me handle the questions and you handle the answers, ok?
I'm a bit of a slob myself.
You and your boyfriend have a party last night?
That'd be fine.  So, Claudia, lemme just say, so I can get my role of LAPD officer out of the way before we enjoy our coffee  I'm not gonna write you up or anything, I'm not gonna give you a citation here -- but the real problem we have is that there are people around here, people that work from their homes, people tryin' to get some work done, and if you're listenin' to your music that loud:  They're incovenienced by that.  If you had a job you'd probably understand, but I see you like listenin' to your music and that's fine, you're just gonna wanna keep it down at a certain volume, maybe memorize what number you see on the dial and just always put it to that -- If it's the middle of the day -- that's what I do -- just put it on two and a half and that's a good listening level, alright? I see you like listenin' to your music loud, but, hey, forget about the neighbors, you end up damaging your own ears ok?
Arlight, then.  Cheers.
-- is not my boyfriend.
It's not my boyfriend -- and it's not anything -- it's over.  Really. It's not.  He won't came back.
Okey-doke.
This is, for not a fresh cup, a great cup of coffee, Claudia --
What is it?  Did you forget something?
You wanna go on a date with me?
Really?
What about ten o'clock, is that too late?  I don't get off and then --
Bye.
I've never found someone really that I think I would like to go out with.
ok.
ok.
You don't how fuckin' stupid I am.
I've got troubles.
Ohhhh I started this, didn't I, didn't I, didn't I, fuck.
Wanna kiss me, Jim?
Yes.
Diet Coke.
It doesn't matter.
Ready to go,go,go?
No, Son...be quiet...be quiet now...
You don't just sign up to be a police officer -- it's about three years of training -- ok?
I ain't fuckin with you --
Now that shit will help you SOLVE the case.
I was listening --
He's doing the interview with the lady --
Yeah, I'm here, I'm off the elevator, walking down the hall, now --
Well you lost me with the last couple of cocktail words spoken, m'boy, but I believe it's that sort of love. Sounds nice to me.
Might of been before my time.
Yes they do, they do, but I'll make my dreams come true, you see?  I will.
Stay that way.
"It's a dangerous thing to confuse chidlren with angels..."
FUCK YOU.  I pay you, I paid you. I give you a fucking chance and a chance and over and over, over you let me down.  I trust you with so much. The keys to my store, the codes to my locks, the life, the blood of my bussiness and return is smashing in seven-eleven, late, <u>always</u> late, loans -- I loaned you money for your kitchen that you never did --
You were gonna ask me weren't you?
We can fix that, because I can give you -- are you listening?
Ok. Linda:  Earl is not gonna make it. He's dying. He is.  He is dying very, very rapidly --
She went out.  She said she went out to run some errands.  She'll be back.
How come every word you say is either "cocksucker," or "shitballs," or "fuck?"
Go fuck myself?
Graduation?
Hi.  Is Frank there?
Are we gonna tape some stuff now?
So boring, so useless --
In aid of what?
An old stomping ground --is this the "attack" portion of the interview, I figured this was coming sooner or later -- Is "the girl" coming in for the kill?
Go ahead and waste your time.
I'm quietly judging you.
Around here.
My father worked in televison. My mother -- this is gonna sound silly to you -- she was a librarian.
people die.
Right.
...this close...
My mother's name, actually. Good question.  You've done you're research.
I wouldn't want that to be misunderstood: My enrollment was totally unoffical because I was, sadly, unable to afford tuition up there.  But there were three wonderful men who were kind enough to let me sit in on their classes, and they're names are: Macready, Horn and Langtree among others. I was completely independent financially, and like I said: One Sad Sack A Shit. So what we're looking at here is a true rags to riches story and I think that's what most people respond to in "Seduce," And At The End Of The Day? Hey -- it may not even be about picking up chicks and sticking your cock in it -- it's about finding What You Can Be In This World.  Defining It.  Controling It and saying: I will take what is mine.  You just happen to get a blow job out of it, then hey-what-the-fuck- why-not?  he.he.he.
For six months.  I'm the day nurse...
I work as a nurse, for a proffesion --
Oh yeah.
Quietly, slow down, whoa --
I got a call to this apartment, report of a disturbance --
I got a call of a disturbance, you're door was open, I just wanna see what's goin' on --
You're not calm.  You're screamin' and yellin' and I'm here to check on a disturbance that was reported and that's what I'm gonna do - now are you alone in here?
Maybe so, but I'm gonna ask you one more time: Is Anyone Else In This House Right Now?
I'm not askin', Marcie.
Maybe you didn't, but I'm here to find out about a disturbance. Some neighbors called said they heard screaming and a loud crash.
Mischief?  What the fuck you talkin' about, mischief?
It's ten o'clock in the morning --
THAT'S NOT MINE.
Yes.
Are you alright?
I don't know.  I have to go, I don't have time and I have more drinking to do before I go march --
It'll take the pain away.
No, I mean:  I'm telling you this, now. You see?  You see I want to make everything clear and clean...and apologize for me....for all the stupid things I've done....that will eat me up....
I don't know.
Stay here, please don't leave me, please, please, if I said I knew would you stay?
Are you her boyfriend?
What's MOW?
No they don't --
No...I just... I'm so fucked up here Alan, I don't know...there's so much...so many things --
-- I have something to tell you. I have to tell you something. I want to change his will, can I change his will?...I need to ---
What kind of medication are you on right now, Linda that's --
Hang up the phone.
Earl asked me, Linda, please, Linda, I'm sorry -- Earl asked me --
mmmhmm.
I'd like to get an order of...um...peanut butter.
Cigarettes. Camel Lights.
And um....do you have Swank magazine?
Thank you.
I gotta go to the bathroom.
Shut up -- shut up --
-- the fuck are you talking about?
You're late, not me.
Sure.
Stand up.
Hi.
It's ok.
I have money to give you.
We haven't visited in three years. And we should have privacy.
Shut up, knave!
Replace the king.
Excellent, Athos.  You have a keen sense of this man.
There is that, of course -- but mainly it is because I am so much smarter than everyone else.
Three days??!!
Hold your goblet with two fingers.
To the Bastille.  And death.
You can't do it.
Can't you see I'm praying, goddammit?!
It is also a place of burial.
Not just a baby, Porthos.  I carried the child of the king.
What use am I?
Why didn't you say so?
Come on...
Who?
Perhaps this will help.
We were at her door.  I was just taking the ring from my pocket, for the third time today, when a young Musketeer brought the invitation for her to become a lady-in-waiting for the Queen Mother.
I have rejoined the army, and asked to resume my commission at the head of the troops of General Fromberge.
You can't drink with a friend you haven't seen in months?
If the young woman truly loves Raoul --
An oath is an oath precisely because it cannot be removed!
I came to see you safely out.  Check for yourself.
Perhaps not as much as you might imagine.  When tutors answered every question except those about who I was.  When I was imprisoned in a way no other man had ever been, I knew there was something different about me.  But a king...
I did not share beauty with someone... who is no longer here for me to share beauty with.
Who came?
I am King, d'Artagnan.  I will change my mind as I wish, and I will enjoy my banquet as I wish!
It... was nothing.  A nightmare, nothing more.  Go away, I --
You will protect me as you always have, d'Artagnan.
No.  Even if I could give up my friends, I could never give up my son.
... Two-thirty-seven.
No.  He cut an ear from one of the men, no one else was hurt.  Captain d'Artagnan allowed him to leave. Athos was upset about the death of his son, at the front.
The corridor nullifies our number... And no one has stomach to fight the Captain.
How did I get in?  You're new here, and will soon learn many secrets. What is that?
Raoul... is in love...
Listen, my darling... Raoul was a... a good friend.  And now he is dead and that is very sad but --
Yeah?
We ran the i.d.  I could have told you that.
Or worse, we'll have a hostage situation on our hands.
You mean shut your ass down!
I didn't hit shit!
Fine -
When did you join the force?  You know, the police force, the place you work...
Gotta come from somewhere...
She stole my car!!
Did he harm the girl?
And what did he do to the girl?
That's not all.  According to the computer - she died of a drug overdose last year.
No Zydowski I didn't read today's paper - it's just going to irritate the hell out of me.
They found the getaway Mercedes a parking garage north of Venice. It checks out.
Yeah...they did.  One girl...
I got out of there.	I just grabbed up my stuff, and then I found it.
What did you do then?
Yeah.
I killed them.
They're inside the department, they're everywhere - it's not safe.
Shit, what I have now made our setup in Angola look like Tinker Toys.  I've been skipping through Internal Revenue records all day. I even have video strip poker. You want to check it out?
1490...Breckinridge...
I knew I could count on you.
A bank?
Well I've kind of had my fill of the place, you know what I mean?
Did you have sexual intercourse with the woman in question?
Where is he?
I asked him not to tell me where he was going.  I told him I don't want any part of it.
He doesn't think you run mind games on him.
Book code?
Library of Congress.
I have to.
What was in the 'Miami Herald' and the 'Times.'  Confessions?
What else did you keep out of the papers?
No.
The Bureau already has the best lab. Plus you have Bloom at the University of Chicago...
I am all right.
I know...
When I'm done.
VTR, film, Polaroid, stills, what?
What's that?
We want the cans the Jacobi home movies came in.  They're in the far corner of the room under the windows.
Wait for the back-up! Will?
Let's get to the physical.
They got shot a Telex. They're on if now...
The activities of nocturnal animals.
Thanks, but I'll take the bus. I do it all the time.
Tonic will be fine.
I made you a gin and tonic. It's by the side of the sofa...
I have work to do at the plant.
I want to see you, too, Francis... Should I come over?
It's me.
Was I in an accident?
Yes.
Yes.
Oh, God.
Not me.
Hi, Linda. ..
We're looking for Graham. The man the book is supposed to go to is a Mr. Will Graham.
Why do you think I called?
You tell me what you know about him. I'll tell you whether you're right or not.
I don't think I'll tell you.
Goodbye.
Yes. 'Intimate.' They had privacy.  Everybody else was dead.
He only bit women so far, right?
Nine that we know of. Two didn't die.
Psychologists call him a sociopath. They don't know what else to call him.
I call him a monster.
Was the dog wearing a collar with the Leeds' name on it?
Did the Jacobis in Birmingham have a dog?
Huh?  Will? Is that you?
I remember.
I wanted it over fast.  It felt dirty to not tell you.
I have to go back to Birmingham.
No. I have to be in there...  alone. Maybe there's something for me if I know how he feels and thinks.
Well, how you doin', Mr. Graham?! You sure are in the center of a storm. Burning up lots of taxpayer's dollars, too, I bet.  On the news they said he was a white man. He isn't really, is he?
My grandboy's been eatin' a ton of breakfast every day. Been out riding. Must be the good air. You oughta see that little booger eat.  I'll bet he's gained ten pounds.  Molly's out in the motor home...
What's that?
There's a VTR setup waiting in your hotel room, that you asked for. They transferred the home movies of both families onto half-inch VHS.
Are you George Sherman?
Yeah, but not now... These will all make it... guaranteed.
No. You're very well-protected.  No one can find our where you are.
Hobbs was insane. He was attacking college girls and he killed them.
Huh?
I got it. Thank you.
You've read the transcript. It's all there.
I thought you would have some ideas.
That's interesting.
Yes. I'd considered it.
Do you know how you caught me, Will?
Yes.
You got it.
Tank you veddy much.
George, I hate sitcoms.
Those are my terms.
The ONLY reason I did Taxi was so I could have my own Special!
You're DAMN RIGHT you're sorry!  And you -- you're the road manager! You should be watchin' out for him!
That's ridiculous.  You don't even smoke.
You know Tony doesn't have that kind of money.
You've got good days and bad days.
Yeah!  He's a psychic surgeon in the Philippines, and he's amazing!  He rubs you and sucks the disease right out!
You know that's not what I meant! Look, I'm gonna put my foot down! No more playing alone.  You wanna perform, you GOTTA have an audience!
No!  That is NOT an audience!  That is PLASTER!  An audience is people made of flesh!  They -- live and breathe!  Got it?!
Twenty!
Do you wanna wrestle?  It's a good way of breaking the ice.  That instant physical intimacy really brings two people together.
Gosh.  Gee, Lynne... I was just so impressed with your wrestling moves. EXT. MOVIE THEATER - DAY
I'm here, ain't I?
Do I wanna go to Memphis and get married?
It's me.
You don't know the real me.
No, NO!  Not yet.  I feel bad -- I've jerked 'em around so many times.
Even if I'm dying -- I still need clean socks.
Andy, it'll be fine!  It's what we're known for!  "Maui?  "Wowie!"
You're a wimp.
Then your father's a wimp.
She'll say, "Now my son is a man."
Who gives a shit?!  It's not funny!
Yeah, exactly -- "was"!  But now, you're creatively bankrupt.  In fact, Ladies and Gentlemen, Kaufman's so desperate, he PAID me to do this tonight!!  I'm a plant. It's just a fresh coat of paint on an old broken-down routine.  Isn't that true???
And you say, "Santa, what am I gettin' for Christmas?"  And he says, "Cancer!"
Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I know!  Wink wink!  Nudge nudge!
Sure it is.  Tony called me himself. He yelled at me, insisting that his dressing room be bigger than Andy's. They're both going on tonight, believe me!
Andy, I'm calling you up like this because I have the utmost respect for your artistry.  But -- I need your permission to fire him.
Look... I don't know what your problem is...
So your name's not Gorsky.
Sure!  But WE think it's kickass! Now I get to be Tony.  I get to dump the glass of water on someone else's head!
I used to think you were original.
Yeah.  They don't know whether to be sad, or angry.
Of course he's in his room.  All his "friends" are in there.
He said he's coming back!
They're gonna lynch him!
Expect it.  Did you get anything from the room?
And you are?
Oh shit.
No, Lieutenant, your men are already dead.
No way.  Not possible.
What?
It's Choi.
I don't know... My computer...
All the time.  It's called mescaline and it is the only way to fly.
We're going to kill him.  Do you understand that?  He's going to die just like the others.
Cypher?  Where's Tank?
You killed them.
That's what you think.  They've promised to back me, Trinity. They're going to reinsert my body. I'll go back to sleep and when I wake up, I'll be fat and rich and I won't remember a goddamn thing. It's the American dream.
Sorry.
The Matrix?  Yeah.
Have to.  The image translators sort of work for the construct programs but there's way too much information to decode the Matrix.  You get used to it, though.  Your brain does the translating.  I don't even see the code.  All I see is blonde, brunette, and redhead.  You want a drink?
... Yeah.
I got you.
Shit!  Apoc?
He's beginning to believe.
Yes.  Now.
Yes.
There are only two ways out of this building.  One is that scaffold. The other is in their custody.  You take a chance either way.  I leave it to you.
What do you know?
Because I don't like the idea that I'm not in control of my life.
What truth?
This can't be...
Far from it.
You've never used them before.
For what?
You -- you're too fast.
I'm trying to free your mind, Neo, but all I can do is show you the door.  You're the one that has to step through.  Tank, load the jump program.
Your mind makes it real.
The body cannot live without the mind.
What -- what lesson?
Of the Resistance.
Don't think of it in terms of right and wrong.  She is a guide, Neo. She can help you find the path.
Why?
I need the main wet-wall.
Goddamn!  It's good to hear your voice, sir!
Yes, sir.
Do it!
Honestly?  I don't know.
What?
How do you know that name?
I just thought... you were a guy.
Right now, all I can tell you, is that you are in danger.  I brought you here to warn you.
They're watching you, Neo.
... right as rain.
No?  Let me tell you what I believe. I believe Morpheus means more to me than he does to you.  I believe that if you are serious about saving him then you are going to need my help and since I am the ranking officer on this ship, if you don't like it then I believe that you can go to hell, because you aren't going anywhere else.
No.
The Oracle.
What do they want?
Duck!
You're not far from Cypher.
I'll be all right.
Tank, I need a pilot program for a military M-109 helicopter.
What the hell just happened?
Hurry, Neo.
Sounds good.
Let go of her.
You sure?
Well, maybe they do that in Riverdale, but down here we take cash.  Now, you got it or not?
Don't go to any trouble.  We believe you... We believe you.
Be careful.
'Take a little tip from Mack the Knife...'
You are with out a doubt the biggest, most pretentious bullshit thrower I know.  Like to see what kind of business you'd do.
'And with your spirit.'
'Thou art then a king?'
I don't know, but God help him if he does it again!
Kennedy.
Yeah.
I bet 235.  Because I dreamt of my grandfather - and when he died, the number of the funeral parlour was 235 - so when I dreamt...
Giovanino!  Where have you been?
Did you see them run!
How?
That'll help you out fine.  That's the best way for you, not for me! I swear to God, I'll rip you open if my uncle ever hears a word about this.  You understand?  I don't care what happens, he doesn't find out. 
Oh, that's too bad, Teresa...
Charlie, twenty-eight bucks is nothing.  The only way to do it is through your uncle...think about it will you?
You seen Johnny Boy tonight?
Whatever.
Yeah, where's the rest?
You're not going to use that gun, Johnny.
Fine.
Oh yeah, that's a possibility.
Oh, that's ok...I've been in and out of this place fifty times.
It's all right.
Anything specific?
What is it now?
You missed the point.  The kid's a climber...not very bright...but if you get down to his level to look at it his way; he kills a guy who insulted a big man - he gets a reputation.  He thinks he's in good standing.
It was nothing.  I'm almost finished.
I know you don't.  You've been very preoccupied lately.
Now don't get excited.  Don't get excited!!
Charlie...I've got to see you.  I want to talk...
Yeah, so things'll be even.
Yeah, I think so.
You could say that.
Friends of yours Michael.
Quiet please.
And isn't it a lovely one?  So sturdy, so straight --
Yeah, speak for yourself.
Unfortunately.  I sat between them at the Bronx Zoo benefit -- it was better than Seconal.
Of course.
Yeah?  And what about my enemies?
You know what I'm saying, Joe?
Hello, Quince.
Bontecou wants a speedier response than that.
Yes.
Well, I'm going to tell you anyway. I did cheat on that exam at Groton. But so did twenty-six other guys, and nobody ever mentioned it until today.  And I'm expecting you won't mention it again.  I don't know who you are and where you're getting your information, but I'm willing to pretend I did not hear it, and let bygones be bygones.  But can I tell you something else, it'd be nice to see the big guy without you next to him.  What are you, his shadow?  Do you hold his dick for him when he goes to take a leak?  You know some- times somebody would like a few min- utes alone with W.P.  That means without you.  Okay, pal?  Let's eat.
Not good, not bad, you know what we got?  Nothing.  No credit, no cars, no mortgages -- no wives.  Nothing.
Well, it's a big day.  Wanted to line up a few ducks before kickoff. Any thoughts?  Last minute refine- ments or variations?
No no, not you.
Do you think I need a haircut?
As close as a deal could be.
What?!
I am now.
I was hired, you told me, to help bring Parrish Communications into the 21st Century.  This merger is the vehicle --
Okay, we'll see you tomorrow.
Certainly, Bill.
Mandatory retirement upon our Chairman's sixty-fifth birthday.
You get not to go to jail.
Quince, m'man, thanks for the offer, but it's all set for just me and Bill. More people might --
Are you?
'It's up to Joe'?  Those were his words?
Go right ahead.  Tell William Parrish how you betrayed him at a secret Board meeting.  And tell Allison how you got her father fired -- and he lost his company.
Obeah evil.  I not evil.
Mine, too.
Rass!
Schoolboy tings is you head. Badness for you, badness for her, badness for me, lyin' here tumor, big as breadfruit, poison my inners an' waiting.
Only flowers I wan' see's one's over my peaceful self restin' in the dutty.
What?
No problem.  I'll leave you two alone.  I can tell you guys have something on the fire --
And you're a nice man, Quince.
Do I?  I'm a little confused.
You love Allison, don't you?
What would you say if you knew it was me who brought down Bill Parrish?  I told Drew and the Board that Bill depended on you.  Drew led me on, but I had no business telling him in the first place.  He was setting up Bill from day one.  Drew and Bontecou are going to chop up the company and sell it off for parts. Bontecou was outside, Drew was Mr. Inside.  And I was the fool who made it all happen.  Oh God, what do I do?
I'm sorry.
When you put your mouth to his, Susan, it seems a frequent thing.
I guess what I'm trying to say is -- I'd like us to be friends.
Goodnight to you, Susan.
Be sorry for nothing.
Excuse me?
Because guys who never say anything about themselves are always married.
I said get out.
I love you in an evening gown.
Don't.  That will come later.
But you're not.  You're somewhere else.  You're someone else --
Yeah...and you're the prettier thing here.
Thank you.
It hadn't occurred to me until then. I was just having such a wonderful time -- Besides, isn't this what I'm here for?
You're putting me on the spot, Bill.
It is a deal?
That's what everybody says.
I'm sure you'll see to it that it won't be a problem.
You're not thinking of going some- where, are you, Bill?
No thank you, Bill.  I can manage.
Why didn't you stop me?
Goodnight.
That's okay.
I'm sorry to hear that.
Multiply it by infinity and take it to the death of forever and you will still have barely a glimpse of what I am talking about.
Well, they're mine now.
With you?!  Who is 'you'?  Did you tell her who you are?
Prepare yourself, Drew - I am --
Thank you.
You fill the bill, Bill.
Then don't.
What the hell is this?  Who are you?
Yes, Bill.  The question.
It's okay, Quince.  I understand. You've always meant well and I appreciate that.  Sometimes things just turn out -- wrong.
Sure.
Well said, Eddie.  Mr. Black, shall we?
Please, Eddie, no 'Fat Lady Sings" shit.
No, I'm going to stay down here, keep my finger in the dike and maybe by Monday, the waters could recede.
Hi, honey.
You like him, don't you?
And I'm your daughter and no man will ever be good enough for me.
What were you going to say?
I know.  But I'm the only father you've got.
A-Okay.  Got my gloves on, my ears pricked.  I'm ready for action.
Raise away.
I'm sorry.
I want you to know how much I love you.  That you've given a meaning to my life that I had no right to expect, and that no one can ever take from me.
Not at all.  It was fascinating.
You and 'Honey'?
So you're a one-girl guy?
-- This is my lucky day.  I arrive in this big bad city and I not only find a doctor, a beautiful woman as well.
You never know.  Lightning could strike.
I've been thinking... I don't want you to be my doctor.  Because I don't want you to examine me.
Because I like you so much.  You have coffee here every morning, don't you?  If I came by, could you give me the name of a doctor?
Relax a little, okay? Take off your jacket.
Sense of humour went with the memory, huh? You know why you're still here, don't you?
No. Just leave the stuff lying around as if it were yours. Like you just took it off or something.
I'm sorry... um... ?
What's it like?
This isn't my room?
Then why is this my handwriting?
Why?
* I'm not too good on the phone. I need to		    * look people in the eye when I talk to			  * them.							    *
Thanks.
I forget.
Yeah, I remember you.
Take the money and walk away!
Sorry, I should have explained. You see, I have this condition -
Tell me about her again.
Deals?
Sounds perfect? What do I owe you?
Who is he? What have you got me into?
That's the problem! How can I find John G. when I don't know what's going on?! How did you get me into this?!
Did you?
Kill him.
I told him about your car.
Somebody's come. Already.
Don't protect him.
Kill him. I'll pay you.
About your whore of a wife?
Can I ask you something?
Well, that's me.
You have no idea where you've just come from? What you've just done?
I want you to forget the company you work for for thirty seconds, and tell me if you really think that Sammy is faking his condition.
Don't be a prick. I'm not reading it to annoy you, I enjoy it. Just let me read, please.
Leonard, you don't have a clue what's going on. You don't even know my name.
You're in a playful mood.
You know it?
I don't remember.
You said you were leaving town.
Just for revenge. That's what keeps me going. It's all I have.
You called me. You wanted my help. You know, Lenny, I've had more rewarding friendships than this one. Although I do get to keep using the same jokes.
What's wrong with this one?
Lenny, as a buddy, let me inform you. Your business here is very much finished. You're still here because of Natalie.
How long do you think you can hang around here before people start asking questions?
He knows you're no good on the phone, so		    * he calls you up to bullshit you.				  * Sometimes you stop taking his calls, so			* he slips something under your door to			  * frighten you into answering your phone			 * again. He's been pretending to help you.		    * Feeding you a line of crap about John G.		    * being some local drug dealer.					*
'Cos he fucking told me. He thinks it's funny. He's laughing at you.
Well, I hope it's not as serious as his, 'cos this guy's dead.
Sammy let his wife kill herself! Sammy ended up in an institution - !				    *
Sammy didn't have a wife.
Why do you keep lying to me?					 *
Just some guy. Does it even matter who? I stopped asking myself why a long time ago. No reason, no conspiracy; just bad fucking luck. A couple of junkies, too			 * strung out to realize that your wife didn't live alone. When you killed him,			* I've never seen you so happy - I was convinced you'd remember. But it didn't stick, like nothing ever sticks. Like this won't stick.
Quit it!							 * 					   * You're not a killer, Lenny. That's why			 * you're so good at it.						   *
You can't just take it!
This bad cop. He checked you into the			  * Discount Inn. Then he's been calling you		    * for days, sticking envelopes under your			* door, telling you shit.						 *
Lemon or lime?
So what's gonna persuade Montoya to change off Sal Maguda running his deliveries...?
Make it 35.
You do.
I'm a fiend for mojitas.
It goes very fast.
Havana.
Okay.  Macon, Georgia is where I was born. Wound up in a juvenile facility.  I was 14.  Then the military.  Then prison.  Because I was dumb and angry.  Then I read.  Then I got smart.  Then I discovered what I know, now...it's all business...
'Cause we <u>guarantee</u> every load.  Anywhere, for any reason, it comes up short, we make good.  Your operations will, from now on, run risk-free.
I need thirty.  Calculate in, also, the cash you don't have to front...
Do I need it?
This is the talk of a man...if he were your husband...he would never put you at risk.  He would never put you within a thousand miles of anything that could hurt you.
Maybe.  Maybe with the crazy whites.
No.
I am not John Wayne.  There is no "S" on his chest.  We get down if the play calls for it.  But we are into business and making money.
"Extras" tried to relieve us of your weight...  And by the by, you know of a player in Overtown who goes by the name of "Things Aquatic"?
Hey, Captain Kirk.  I think maybe I have second thoughts.
Backup in case the Russians get physical.
The honey trap.  And there's the honey.
Transpo?  How they bringing the loads in...?
We're makin' moves on each other.
Do you <u>believe</u>...I have forgotten I am a cop?
Twenty on my man...
Too fast.  Too many moving parts.
What's your Miami PD badge number?
Okay.  What's up?
"Buy and walk"?  "Buy and bust"? "Reverse undercover"?  What?
NLR, we think.  I wanna know...
Haiti and Puerto Rico.  Money through Dubai and Geneva maybe.
Hi, Gina.  This is from Frick and Frack. Trudy?
How will it stand up?
Haitian, Dominican, Russian, Israeli?
But Miami PD wasn't part of the J.I.T.  And from what Alonzo said, he didn't give you up.
Reality TV and stay by the phone. That's what all wives-in-crime do...
They're serious.  They're cautious. They'll forgo a deal over a technicality of how a delivery's handled...they'd walk away, rather than compromise operational security...that's good.
A good deal, like this with us, for Burnett will be good only temporarily.  He'll get restless because he believes nothing is forever.  Life is dust, make it while you can.  He's ambitious.
"Future" of...?
Meaning...?
The Feeb gig was I front a coupla undercover, Russian-speakers to them.  One's ATF.  And broker the deal.  Set up the meet with the NLR types...
Hers'n zodda meg a livig.
Men, they mostly faggots.
I got me two hundred twenty-four bucks of flat folding money...  He know what he can do with that chicken-shit day's pay. And if he ain't man enough to do it for himself, I be happy to oblige!
Joking? No, ma'am. Oh no! I mean business!
For what?
Now take it. Go on.  Listen, where can I reach you? Cause I'm gonna make this right with you soon's I get me set up...
Not a cent, I swear to God, I swear on my mother's eyes.
It's sticky. What you do, slobber on 'em? I wouldn't touch 'em.
So you could sleep! I mean Christ!
Shee-it, man, I can't say all that.
Well, uh, my manager's gonna manage all that crap, or else he gonna get a coconut up his flue.
And end up a hunchback like my old man? You think I'm crippled? You shoulda caught him the end of a day.
And what?
I'm going to Florida, that's my only chance.
They gotta be.
How'n hell a dumb Bronx kid like you know that?
I wet my pants! My seat's all wet.
Here I am going to Florida and my leg hurts, my butt hurts, my chest hurts, my face hurts, and like that ain't enough, I gotta pee all over myself.
I gotta have more'n ten. I gotta have fifty-seven dollars.
No sir, I'm no cowboy really, but I'm a first class stud.
You bet I do, sir.
Well, uh, I'm raring to go.
Ready for anything.
Ziat!
Stop shitting me, man!
Well, it's an interesting place...  Tell you the truth, I think the food is lousy. The crap they sell in these little restaurants. I went out to eat in one of them last night, and I had to run to the damn toilet... You shoulda' seen the toilet.
Very bad now. Maybe war. Those Greek pigs try to steal Cyprus again ) How'd you lose your friends?
I'll pay extra
All over.  Turkish Army up there. It's against the law. They shoot us.  You sure you looking for your friends, man?
Stupid.
But didn't have heroin.
But just...
Something like that. Cigarette?
Hashish.  Ninety percent of the foreigners are in for hashish.
Section 13?
Yeah!
After we're outside the kogus?
Then I'll cut his balls off.
What?
Oh shit.
Selling your sould for a fistful of carbohydrates...
Triad, Chinese Mafia. They bring people from Yunan. Slave labor...  Reverend Harry Wong, a preacher had the flophouse fronting for them. No sign of him.
What?
H-how do I get...?
Yeah, and you gonna have to show me a lot bigger one you wanna go down there. That's the old maintenance grid, Doc. Swiss cheese: tunnels, tracks...
You wanna keep up the conversation, you best come back with the proper permits and the right attitude.
Well...there's an old service elevator half a mile down the tracks.  Ain't gonna be much use, though.  Lines are dead.
Oh, Jesus!!
"Mistake"?  What's that supposed to...?
Go!! Just go!!
Hurry, the woman needs help!
Chuy. He was taken. He's down here somewhere...  Oh, please, hurry. I saw what was after her.
Nino, please...
Scent glands.  Insects use 'em to identify themselves to each other.
What?
Across both tracks!!
Please.
So?
Susan, we're not b-
You said that thing was big as your hand.  I don't think I'm going to miss...
No.
Ah...
That's it?
How does a nice cup of cocoa sound?
What are they...?
The  blizzard was too strong. I couldn't risk trying to get you there. I tried calling, but the phone lines are down.
I didn't know it was going to be a big storm.
It shouldn't be too much longer.  Once the roads are open, the lines'll be up in no time. If you give me their numbers, I'll keep trying them for you.  Could I ask you a favor?  I noticed in your case there was a new Paul Sheldon book and...  and I wondered if maybe... 
If you wouldn't mind.
You'll never realize what a rare treat you've given me.
It's fine.
Show me the way?
Yes.
You know, Annie, this book never would have survived without you. When it gets to new York, there will be a big auction, and whatever it brings we can split.  God knows you're entitled to it.
Great.
You did great, except there's just one little thing--I can't work with this paper. It's Corrasable Bond, it smudges. Maybe you could go back into town and bring me some white, long-grained mimeo.
C'mere, I'll show you.
I thought you'd be interested. I'd like you to be in on everything, Annie. Not just the finished book, but how it's written.
--not fair?
I'm telling you, I can't.
...have to wait.
Whenever he played Radio City, who do you think was right there in the front row?
Why would you lose me?
Why would I want to leave? I like it here.
What?
Be my guest.
Three more chapters to go.
Maybe.
I'm glad you like it.
Dome Pear-igg-non it is.
You did perfect. Except for one thing. This time we need two glasses.
Work, work, work.  Virginia? When was that blizzard?
Just from his agent.
He might well be. But not the way they say. He didn't crawl out of that car by himself. You saw those dents on the door--someone pulled him out.
That's nice.
I'm sure you know Paul's been going to the Silver Creek Lodge for years to finish his books.
You think he might be missing?
Maybe you can, Libby.
Miz Wilkes? Same old stuff.  --Lest you call paper odd.
It's... it's nice, Paul. It's got... character.
You're still a writer.
Great.
I'm delighted the critics are liking it, and I hope the people like it, too. But it's not why I wrote the book.
Paul, since you brought her up, I have to ask you this, or I'd be drummed out of the agents' union-- what about a non-fiction book? The truth about what went on in that house.
Not possible..
Well, you've thorough about it, at any rate.
Sean, please..
In the envelope in my pocket.  My right.. jacket..pocket..
Well that depends.
Ahh..
Oh, I am.  Later..
Yeah.  Naturally vain -- but they're about to close the betting table and I haven't a sou..
And you're going to have time.  There's been a change of plans.
If it'll make you feel any better I won't do it again.
Billy, make sure Nyah's not followed.
And you're happy about that?
You know, that was the hardest part of having to portray you.  Grinning like an idiot every fifteen minutes.
I knew where it was.
More like two-two point two million.
Then we got'em!
Exactly where is she?
And the check's in the mall.
What if I pay the rent?
Uh-huh?
- torque wrench.
You didn't do that badly.
Not really.  I triggered the alarm..
Care to wait a decent interval?
Oh.  Well..this isn't exactly by the book.
Not revealing information doesn't necessarily make someone a liar.
So do I.  Sort of.
Of what?
Sean Ambrose, for one.
I'd like a little more conviction..
You can be a thief and have a conscience.
Oh, I do.  But as we know I'm a very poor judge of character.
Ethan, you take care of yourself, I'll take care of myself because if push comes to shove, I'm gonna bail - and without giving two week notice.
Just about..
Annex is strictly off limits to me and they never come to the main house, Michael even takes their meals to them all but shoves them under the door.
Bids from possible Chimera buyers -- to prove that as of the date on the newspaper those bids are back up by earnest money --
Betting table twelve off the paddock. Nyah, are you up to this?
Oh Ethan!..
Nyah, it's very important not do anything to alarm Ambrose..
I'm infected with Chimera.  You know you don't have a choice.  Just do it now.
Don't be.  Wouldn't be on vacation if you did.
Why did you phrase it like that?
Then you do think it was Ambrose.
Enough to kill Nekhorvich and two hundred innocent passengers?
In any case, you've got to recover Chimera and bring it to us.
Well you know Nekhorvich's history. You're the one who got him out of the Soviet Union was it still in bio- weapon business.
Go to bed with a man and lie to him? She's a woman.  She's got all the training she needs.
She sacrificed herself..
By fire.  That's the best way, really.
In this case, it wasn't a bad idea.  In face, it was a pretty damn good idea. Just don't make a habit of it.  And, as for Ms. Hall, in light of her efforts, her criminal records will certainly be expunged.  I'm assuming you approve.
No.  After you've lived with <i>Chimera</i> for twenty hours, nothing can save you.  Not even...<i>Bellerophon.</i>
That simple, huh?
Right.  I guess there aren't many flu epidemics in the middle of summer.
Yep.
Nyah, Ambrose is heading back.  There's an enveloped inside --
Yeah.  Why else would he come back to Australia?  If he had them both, he could sell them anywhere.
No garage entrance.  Lobby's protected by five guards on rotating patrol.
You're right, of course.
His name is.....Dimitri Miediev.
Good idea.
Course he did.  Just exactly when he knew is something of a question.  Before or after I showed in London, mind telling me, Ethan?
Ethan, if you knew about Jim?..Why..
Jim - lets just get the money and get out of here.
Krieger.
Walk, just walk.  Start walking.
If you're gonna do this again Claire, It's not gonna be on my watch.
Take off your coat.
I'm going to get it for him.  Whoever the mole is, I think goes by the name of Job, at least part of the time. 1 can't find him, but if he knows 1 have the NOC list, he'll find me.
You're sure about this?
You don't think we're going to make it.
You didn't have to.........
Of course - Im sorry to hear you say that Claire.
My team.  Claire, Jack, even Jim - - Hannah, maybe, I -- dont know
Yeah.  I follow you.
But the list Golitsyn stole was a decoy.
I see you've been out visiting the folks.
I don't know, Ethan. Suppose you tell me?
Because if you knew what you were getting into, you never would have done it.
About what?
Hey, I'm the flavour of the month!
That depends.
The disk Job sold you is worthless.  It's bait, part of an internal molehunt.
That's the question I want to ask Job.
I wouldn't dream of it.
We're not outta here yet.
I didn't touch it.
Roger that.  Opening doors now.
Jim gave an abort, we should walk away.
Allowing Max to see you and hear what you've got to say.
A hundred and sixty-seven, I think it is. Take it all, if you want.  <u>After</u> this one.
I don't know, I had to go to Chicago again.  You were in Kiev.  You tell me.
When you started noticing your short term memory loss.  What <u>the problem was</u> you and Claire had in Kiev?
Ah, God, forget it.  What are we talking burnout here?
Ethan, you <u>can't</u> burn out.
He's our guy.
Not this week. This week he's flyfishing at the Oughterard Slough in County Kildare, with one of our best Irish guides.
If you were me, Ethan, who would <u>you</u> trust to make him believable?
About two hundred yards from the bridge.
I can sit up straight.  I just can't..sit up straight very well.  It's not important!  I saw who shot me.  Ethan, I saw the mole.  It was Kittridge.  <i>Kittridge!</i>
We dont have to, Jim.  Hell come after us.
They stamped it, didnt they?  Those damn Gideons.
But, he didnt know about you.  In all fairness, Ethan, Claire was never convinced her charms would work with you. But I was supremely confident - having tastes the goods.  "Thou shall not covet thy Neighbours wife", Ethan.  Oh, Ethan is in love with you, Claire, make no mistake about it.  And like all the worlds lovers, hes tortured by the same, one pathetic question - "does she feel the same way I do?"
Loud and clear.
Jack...that's spying.
Jack you're so wicked.
I think I might just take that look.
And a lonely ass.
That's not so good for you, my friend.
No, I'm going.
Just across the bay, at the fuel depot. The men wanted to try to get home. I can't explain.
I know, I am so sorry for so many things. I love you, Moira. I love you. I love you.
Nobody. Loretta is getting married.
He didn't used to be cheap. He thinks if he holds on to his money, he will never die.
I'm going to bed now.
Yes.
Your life is not built on nothing. Ti amo.
I know you don't. That's the point. I'll say no more.
Bed.
What's your news?
He did?
Everything is temporary. That don't excuse nothing.
What are you doing here?
Alright. I didn't see you here.
And what did they say?
They are little stars and birds. Birds fly to the stars, I guess.
You have too many dogs.
Hurry up, hurry up. We open in five minutes.
I'm calling for your brother Johnny. He's getting married and he wants you to come.
I don't understand.
But that wasn't Johnny's fault.
You'll eat this bloody to feed your blood.
Why what?
So. Five years ago your hand got cut off and your woman left you for another man. No woman since then?
Just Johnny.
What? Do you think you're the only one ever shed a tear?
Me neither.
Take it easy.
She didn't like me.
What did you do?
But he wants me to come!
For what?
Come on.
I think that's it.
I wanna go home.
You're late!
That's right.
Good! We can get this out on the table.  I'm Ronny, Johnny's brother. 
Before all these people, yes, I will marry you, Ronny Cammareri!
Johnny.
Bobo, take the cart away.
I don't understand.
On the floor?
My mother is dying. When she is dead, I'll come back and we'll be married.
A week. Two weeks. No more.
Not yet. I'm waiting till a moment when she's peaceful.
Well. I told my mother that we were to be married. And she got well. Right away.
I have something to tell you. But I must talk to you alone.
In time, you will drop dead, and I will come to your funeral in a red dress.
Good. When you love them they drive you crazy cause they know they can. But you like him?
Pop don't like Johnny.
I got married before, you didn't sell.
She's dying. But I could still hear her big mouth.
Cosmo's cheating on me.
Well. I don't really know where to start.
Everything's different.
No. Are you drunk?
No more he's not.
I guess it ain't modern times in Sicily. He came right from the airport. He wanted to talk to you. You got a love bite on your neck. He's coming back this morning.
Hi. Why ain't you at the store?
The bank. OH MY GOD, I FORGOT TO MAKE THE DEPOSIT!
Then it was not a sin. But what was that second thing you said, Loretta?
That's a pretty big sin.
If I hit the stick too hard, the apple will split. If I am too timid, the apple will fall off the stick.
Cosmo drank five glasses of wine at dinner.
Where is she?
What are you doing here? You're supposed to be in Palermo.
I don't know.
Good.
You're forty-two years old, Johnny, and Mama is still running your life.
I am alone in the world.
What happened?
Absolutely!
She was just too young for you.
There's old saying my mother told me. Would you like to hear it?
Why do men chase women?
Sure.
You mean the whole house?
Oh.
What are you talking about, Raymond? Cosmo can't own the moon.
Did you dress her up like this?
Quiet! Quiet!  There are ways of telling whether she is a witch.
Tell me ...  what do you do with witches?
So how can we tell if she is made of wood?
It is I, Arthur, son of Uther Pendragon, from the castle of Camelot.  King of all Britons, defeator of the Saxons, sovereign of all England!
Yes!
The swallow may fly south with the sun, or the house martin or the plover seek warmer hot lands in winter, yet these are not strangers to our land.
Well, it doesn't matter.   Go and tell your master that Arthur from the Court of Camelot is here.
We don't have a lord.
Ni!  Ni!  Ni ... Peng ... Nee ... Wum!
That is a good shrubbery.  I like the laurels particularly - But there is one small problem.
We are now no longer the Knights Who Say Ni!
Course I have.
What are you going to do. bleed on me?
'Allo.  Whoo is eet?
This is the castle of of my master, Guy de Loimbard.
Er ... We ... Launcelot, Galahad, and I ... Er ...  leap out of the rabbit and ...
Then we'd best leave them here and carry on on foot.
Greetings King Arthur.
Quite.
There.
It is the rabbit.
What?
Well ... I AM king.
Yes.
Be quiet!  I order you to shut up.
Shut up!
Shut up, will you. Shut up!
Bloody peasant! 
Come on, patsy.
And don't apologize.  Every time I try to talk to someone it's sorry this and forgive me that and I'm not worthy and ... What are you doing now?
... Well, we did do the nose.
My name is Sir Launcelot.
He hasn't got shit all over him.
Well, I'm really am most awfully sorry but I ... I can explain everything ...
Er, Well ... the thing is ... I thought your son was a lady.
Is it?
But, Mother ...
I'd rather ... just ... sing ...
Shut your noise, you,  and get that suit on!
Leaving the room.
No ....  keep him in here ... and make sure he doesn't ...
No ... just keep him in here.
No, not anyone else - just me.
Okay.  Fine.  We'll remain here until you get back.
Oh yes, of course!  I thought you meant him!  You know it seemed a bit daft me havin' to guard him when he's a guard ...
Look, let me go back in there and face the peril?
I am, sir. I am a Knight of King Arthur.
I didn't.
So, there are rules.  Things you do and things you don't do.
That's pretty good for a ghillie.
I can't let her down now, Archie.
Get out.  Out!
It's a diary.
Your Royal Highness.  What a pleasure to see you here.
I see.
It is a disgusting habit, Bertie.  It should be discouraged.
Brown's responsibilities are onerous enough already.  He has far too much to do without having to stay up all night waiting for you to go to bed. The smoking-room will be closed and the lights put out at twelve o'clock.
Not now he doesn't.  This is my place.
How will I know what she requires?
I need a man who knows where I am.
Aye, do.
I beg your pardon?
There are important papers from --
I don't doubt that the Queen was highly amused.  She has always had a very healthy sense of humor.
We are all of us subject to forces beyond our control, Mr Brown, even you.
I don't think about it.
What I do, I do for my Queen.
I do what I do.
Aye.
Why do you think I keep her here?
I'm glad of it.
I've no family, ma'am, apart from my brothers and sisters.
Yes, ma'am.
Sir Henry is not alone.  They all wish it.  The same people who refused to grant my husband the title of King because he was deemed of insufficient rank--
What?
That doesn't make him an expert.
I don't groom a horse to have it admired by others, I groom it because it needs grooming.
Aye.  But there are Fenians reported on the mainland.
Yes, ma'am.
Have I ever let you down before--?
I'm breaking no promises!
Someone has to look after you.  It could've been someone.  It was before.
Oh, several things.
No, ma'am.
She's refusing to leave Balmoral.
Dear oh dear.
Some young page was boasting about having seen it.  Lucky.
Whom?
Why am I being lectured in this way?!
Just them?
I'm very sorry, ma'am.  I can't imagine -- he was certainly given no instructions.
Again?
I have no idea.
I -- forgive me, ma'am, I am no wiser than yourself.
What is it?
My family is quite capable of communicating with the Queen in person.
Yes, ma'am.
You ordered all members of the Royal Family to attend you at Balmoral.
How do you stop The Screamer?
Well...it involves a paradox.  You have to trick The Boatman.  Now all the while, you also have to watch your strength.  You can build that back up by catching FIREFLIES...the little glowing guys...
Sure.
Yeah, who isn't.
He?
He's probably outside.  You know how he is. Gets bored...
We are talking...
I'm in the middle of it...
Call the others.  Laurie, Benz...
It doesn't necessarily mean she's...
We can't...
Give me a break, Alex.  What are we going to tell them?  Excuse me, officer, but there's some sort of electronic monster loose in the phone lines.  I'd think twice about calling any of those 976 numbers...
What?
I was afraid you'd say that.
Yeah, well I figure these are unusual circumstances.
Got it.
The keys are supposed to be at the end of each level.  Once we get all the keys, we can unlock ARCADE's heart. And then...
Screamer.
Is that your question?
Of course I am.
I miss you so much, Alex.  I want so much to be with you...
Yes...but...how did you...
Sign me up.
Fucked up.  That's what they said I was.
The Cowboy??
Yeah, sure. It is that kind of a day. When?
Okay, but you don't know what you're missing.
Yeah.
Okay, I'm thinking.
One.
Well, Sir, I'm afraid they said you're overdrawn at your bank and your line of credit has been cancelled.
Well, I ...
I was afraid of that.
Don't make me out to be a sucker. Louise Bonner says there's trouble in there. You remember last night. Sometimes she's wrong, but if there is trouble - get rid of it.
His name's Wally Brown .... great guy. Been in the business since forever.
Very pleased to meet you.
Well. Shall we get to it? Would you like a water or a coffee before we begin?
Diane?
Maybe that's where the accident was. There must be a police report. We could call.
"I came back. I thought that's what you wanted."
I'm all right.
Everything is A-okay, but I've gotta get that sandwich!
But I want to.
Gotta keep an eye on her, that's all.
Go ahead.
Two men... two guns in the Caddy.
Handstitched Italian. Filled with phony credit cards ... off the two guys in the Caddy.
Find out who they are?
Unreal ... so, you're looking good. Whatcha doin' these days?
It was just a thing. The story made you laugh.
Great.. great. Is there any kind of hint or anything ?
I have an embezzler and his accomplice.
Why should I ?
We have to climb up that.
It's called Murderland. It's paid for by First Bank.
Why would he ? His parents are rich.
You've been doing a bang up job so far. Right now Matt is probably dead and it's your fault.
Not listening !
But how do you know if the people are guilty ?
Yeah, everyone has to when they get hired.
What do you do with the company, if I might ask ?
You didn't think about it did you ? I read your file. It said you had a nervous breakdown.
Okay.
Fine...
The Brooklyn Bridge.
Yes.
Girder, watch your head.
There's one more person here for me to visit.
Well, surprise, surprise, I've been on the payroll for several years now. I still have an office and secretary. No one even batted an eyelash. Do you realize what the high turnover is in a multi corporation bank in New York ?
Yes, can I help you ? Maybe a donut or something ?
Hey , Hey !
I told him not to sit down in there.....
I don't help criminals.
What the fuck are you talking about.
Yes, sir Mom. 
Not yet.
I said NO.
You've got it boss. One more mangled body to the East River, coming up !
And who bailed you out when a hit was put on you, you sorry sack of shit. Who put you up ? Who gave you a job ?
Matthew lives on the Upper West Side, kinda posh for a temp don't you think ?
Checking..... Hah ! He has a shit load of unpaid parking tickets...
I'm sick of playing. I've got a better idea.
I am thirty two.
Yes sir.
But sir, most of the people we are putting into the "Park" are accountants that embezzle or investment bankers. They are not known for their physical or intellectual prowess.
Sir ?
John, sir.
Better, sir.
There was a bit of confusion on one of my last jobs.
I didn't think even this company could afford to write off enough to build a new "Park".
No I am not.
What ?????
What happened ?
I've never heard the Flintstones reduced to a sexual exploitation quite like that. You're funny.
Actually, I'm more interested in the man behind the wheel more than the manufacturer. So what is it that you have that makes you a materialistic fool ?
What the hell kind of cop are you ?
Which one, this door is locked !
Zach from work ?
I'm fine.
Come to the rescue again I see.
Good morning.
UCLA? My cardigan sweater period.
Ohhhhh.
I was drinking a little in those days.  I'm drinking a little these days too.
What are you gonna do? Tell them that...a polite person helped carry your bag?
You kidding? he picks up a picture and shows Vada and Nick
Suspended from school, my mother??
His name is Jeffrey Pommeroy and he used to drive a 54 Ford pickup, black with red interior. Please?
Pommeroy.
I'm leaving Sunday.
Well the thing is your room is right next door to ours, and so we thought, well, I thought, if you were willing we might move you to Grammoo's room, and use your old room for the nursery. See we're gonna be up half the night with a newborn and there'll be a lot of noise....
Okay thanks, atta girl.
Well you know what I mean.
Me? What makes you think there's something on my mind?
No it's okay, I understand, really.
Great.
Her favorite poet.
Uh huh, a boy, you've got a new brother.
You can do anything you want. You're his sister.
Oh come on Harry, we're talking about five days here.
Well, we didn't have a camera...so she just wrote the date on the bag and said, &quot;This will be out wedding album, this will be a day we will never forget.&quot; We never did.
I thought that...umm...maybe you'd be curious about how I turned out.
oh.
You should be here when they bring in a body that's been dead for a couple of days, and they haven't found it yet, 'cause it was in an apartment, and no-one came to visit, or floating in a river, and then the body starts turning this weird shade of green, you know, like watery pea soup? The arms and legs deteriorate first, the body looks like a raisin with four fat legs. Anyway, this is why I'm seriously considering cremation. Judy??
But I wanna write about her.
No-one invented gravity, it just exists.
Ehh...I'm staying at the chateau and the guy who runs the garage there said that you're the best Jag people in town...so uhm.
You're so clever.
No THANKS!
I wasn't eavesdropping, I was overhearing.
Well look, I know that all you care about is your precious mini-bike. It's obvious you have no sense of historical perspective, I think we're here.
WHAT??
What if you don't wanna be found?
Who are you? Hitler's hall monitor?
And I thought I was weird.
Oh, no wait, I like that you bought me here.
Well, it doesn't open cans or anything but it...it's sort of a reminder of a friend of mine.
I want it back now. I never should have taken it off, I want it back.
DON'T!!!
Leave me alone!!
Jerk! You IDIOT!!!
Good. I mean...
I already did, it's a totally barbaric custom...but on you, it looks good.
You better ace it...you sacrificed our whole vacation.

For the mini-bike fund.
Well I know you're not crazy about taking Vada around tomorrow, so...I just want you to know I appreciate it though.
You stay out of this, look, if I had a red XK-150 with a black interior, I sure as hell wouldn't be handing out relationship advice.
He was very polite, worth the entire five dollars.
I'll do better than that. I'll send you off with your own private guide.
Then we'll keep driving...you'll decide.
Okay...take your time...I'll...I'll go for a walk around.
There's plenty of fruit.
You know exactly...what kind it is. Come on Rose...what do you want from me?
Oh, ahh, oil change, I...ehh...I just drove in from Chicago and uhh...nice hair.
Mostly...little babies, but...not exclusively.
I'll be here.
Well maybe for you.
You couldn't?
Where I come from, involvement...generally calls for a substantial piece of jewelry.
Oh, sure okay.
I bet your mom sang to you.
When did you umm, I mean umm...
Why do they call them training bra's? It's not like learning to ride a bike.
This is one of my favorite things, her passport.
Uncle Phil just needed a change, a little adventure.
Well you've gotta be prepared.
Yeah, it would be kinda great.
You have no idea.
Beidermeyer that's it, what a mad man.
How do I know you were gonna show us one?
Excuse me, MUTUAL ASSET, that's what the lawyer said, it's supposed to be &quot;OUR MUTUAL ASSET&quot;, not &quot;Shelly's recreational vehicle&quot;. Gimme the keys.
Yeah, all right...
My __EX__ wife seems to have ripped off my camper.
Vada there is no chicken bone stuck in your throat.
Excuse me Harry, I'm sorry, I just wanna let you know that the flowers were delivered. And the room's all set up.
Okay.
No. Just, more activity.
What's that?
Why d'you think these seats were empty.
I don't know, tonight you just seemed a little cool, not opening car doors and...
Yes.
Yeah, me too, mind if I tag along?
Look, you're not gonna take Shelly's camper.
Pointing upwards Look...
Vada, just put 'em on the stool.
Last month you wanted to play the violin. Then you wanted to be a ventriloquist.
No, sweetie, not yet.
Soon honey, soon.
Not acknowledging Harry's comment You'll be okay little fish.
No sweetheart, you can't.
He was allergic to bees.
Ahh, that little Chevy was your mothers favorite car.
She was pretty, and kind, she had your eyes. Oh boy did she love to laugh. Sometimes when you laugh, you sound just like her.
Oh come on.
No, she's just driving over here, then we're taking my car. How do I look?
Oh, I'm Judy, I go to school with her, I wanted to tell her I'm sorry about Thomas J.
It's okay. Mr. Bixler, I finished all the books for summer reading.
Well, you never can tell...  I might get a pet. 
I wrote a poem too.
Justin and Ronda say that I should tell people what I feel.
Pause as he takes all this in I think your Dad would miss you.
Now when I see him with Shelly, sometimes he seems like the old Harry.
Yes it is.
It's a mood ring, it tells what mood I'm in.
Can we look around in your camper?
No, I'm divorced.
Can I use your bathroom first?
Come here, sit down.
Uh huh, i've been trying to get out to Hollywood for years to do makeup for all the stars, I haven't gotten there yet.  All right, open your eyes.
NO!, He's fine.  Fish are very resilient animals you know. Don't worry, I won't get another fish.
Yes!!
I'll pay it back, besides, I don't think i'll ever go to class again.
Hey there's your Dad and Shelly.
Oh wow, a real evil canieval.
Hey, we can become blood brothers.
A girl can never wear enough eye shadow.
It's my mother.
What?
What do you want? My mom will skin me alive if she finds I'm out here.
We're not gonna bet, we're just gonna watch.
You're right, let's knock it down.
Then go home, baby.
No, I'm hiding out.
No.
Okay, okay.
Is Newsday a real interview, or just some cute guy you're setting me up w...
... weeks.
You have a real philosophy of life.
You've been working on this, huh?
I wish.
I can't even say it.
What do you suggest?
To belong to someone.
Hey, handsome.  Brevity this...
Good girl.
Not you.  You won't be comfortable unless you're distinctive.
... garden sports, all.  Little swing of maybe fifty degrees Fahrenheit, represents a packing challenge, but there's fine food and cocktails at a choice of Embassy Suit...
Do you get nervous in small confined spaces?
Well, perfection can get wearing after whi...
... whatever is manly and independent.
Hello.
They'll eat it anyway, you ever been to a walk?
Don't you see...
... that this is all my fault?
... look good on Kimberly.
I had this crank call?  From some guy who thinks he saw her? I said, what would a bride be doin', on her wedding...
He's too proud to beg for help. And if you wait till this comes out, your offer will be like charity. Completely humiliating.
I told him, get the important stuff, Kim's ring.  I'll collect the inconsequentials.
You don't understand.  I've never felt this way about anybody!
W...
Firenze.
What, leaving school...
Never can tell.
Michael, it sounds like a wonderful opportun...
You keep saying that.
If you like.
Have you.
It's more than that.
Me either.
It's just... up there... right in front of Walter's... y'know, computer. If memory serves.
It means a lot.
No, it's for the best, it really is.  We were so wrong for each other.
Well, it happens.
Shhh.
The pus that infects the mucous that cruds up the fungus.
Course, if it's later rather than sooner, I'd hate to be you at six o'clock.  You've got a lot of explaining to...
To the twins' soiree?  So they can paw you and drool...?
Well, forgive me for screwing up your plans!
Nose tackle from the Bears... power forward from the Bulls... defenseman from the Black Hawks... my personal favorite, the designated hitter...
Right here.
What do you have to buy?
Grand Old Opera --
I know that, Star.
Is there food?
Well, I just wondered 'cause being from out or town I wouldn't be able to make anything.
I see.
Well, I have to go thank her for filling in and it's nice to know the tune she sang.
Go to the King Of the Road and thank her.
Honey, it's okay... How do you feel now?
You're so good.
I'm really all right, Barnett. Don't you worry really... I just don't want you to leave me that's all.
You get her those Vitamin E right away.
Haven? Hell,' we've been playing poker together since we were fourteen.
His word? Are you telling me Haven promised you something?
Absolutely. Listen, Barnett, I understand your position.
Oh, no, listen, I don't want to take up too much of your time.
President.
Stop it!
Bill, he's a crazy man.
How come?
She's in Paris.
Not yet.
I'll just be in here.
What is a turkey shoot.
Okay... you get to sleep. I'll see you in the morning. Good night.
She's been in the hospital two weeks yesterday.
Did an exploratory and according to them, she needed an overhaul.
Well, he's really amazing.
No.
I've been so worried, dear. where are you?
Green?  Not Owen Green. Owen Green embezzled money from your grandfather
Well, you'll get it, skin as sensitive as yours.
No, I don't.
Well, I met you that afternoon in the control room and we...
Who is this?  It's Tom.
I've got a gig tonight.
I can't.
Older.
What?
Hundreds of times.
For him?
What!
Out.
Do they have a show to give it to you?
How long have you been together?
Do you study at all?
Hal? Well, Hal and I have been friends for a long time.
He was a good Judge, but that was a long time ago.
Well, I admire your optimism, and I just wondered if it was regional. You ever see any movie stars?
Who?
I never heard of him. Name somebody else.
You really do?  ~ God -- How come you know them?
I'll be damned. Boy, if you could get Ryan to say something about Hal Phillip Walker, wouldn't that be something?
Sure thing.
I'm John Triplette. Excuse me. I got all caught up in looking at you. You'll be fine.
The style of fighting that Tim studied didn't believe in belts.
Tim studied several styles, but his favorite was Jeet Kune Do.
That's what Tim said.
Yes, they were.
I wondered how long it would be before we'd get to be alone together. And I wondered if I could wait that long.
Grace. I'd like to talk to you about your murdered brother Tim, if you feel up to it.
Yeah.
Don't stop!
The prison board and the doctors who examined them.
You been followin' the news coverage?
So, how do I fit into this scheme?
By all means.
What?
She's in the holding cell, on this floor.
Tough titty, it's mine now.
It's video.
Have you talked to Mallory about this?
Let's do it.
Aside from the obvious?
Was massacring all those people worth being separated from your wife for the rest of your life?
Excuse me, did you say an instant of purity? What was the instant of purity? The bodies you left behind on your bloody trail?
It's not that easy, Wayne. Donuts and a smoke only get you so far. You're gonna have to do your job.
Could I get a Coke for Mickey?
Out front.
We are.  Your camera.
I'm not saying it's not gonna hurt, but--
No fuckin' way!
I don't give a damn if a million United States marines, all whistling the halls of Montezuma, are gonna come marchin' down this alley any second. There ain't not fuckin' way in hell I'm leaving you. And that's that!
You made every day like kindergarten.
It's like this, Wayne. Two people are standing in a dark room waiting for the other to attack. These two people can't see each other, yet they know they're there. Now, they can either stand in the dark room forever waiting until they die of boredom, or one of them can make the first move.
Unfortunately, yes.
He squashed him mentally before physically defeating him.
They've hypnotized the nation.
That's the way of the world.
They were especially influenced by 'Conquering Huns of Neptune.'
They actually apologized.
Where do the air ducts lead?
I'll say enough to destroy this wing.
Yeah. Bus is all gassed up and ready to roll.
Would the network really not run it without the interview?
They're mesmerising.
Why?
Oh yes, indeed. Top flight.
Is that her real name?
Lose 'em.
Mr. Wurlitzer, I assure you, I am very familiar with Mickey Knox's career.
I can't do that. Five guys.
No thanks.
You think so, Frankie?
No, boy. Thirty-eight cents worth of gas. And watch you don't make it thirty-nine.
You in a big hurry, boy?
All right, you get out of here, man!
That's right.
Where's Wilma?
Like where?
Guess I don't.
Where was your father born?
Why don't you come over for a beer when you get through?
You work around town?
No. Never had much use for hell-howlers. You goin'?
I like a place with lots of life.
What is it?
Damn few places you can make eighty bucks a week.
You got a problem all right.
Take it easy.
It's better than it used to be. Eight years ago they still had a lynching here. They tied a man to a car and dragged him to death. My father knew who did it, but he didn't say anything.
You would, huh? If I was you, baby - I wouldn't go 'round stickin' out my jugular vein.
Hell, baby, I'm not in the third grade. Well, look - what' we gonna do next time -- have a nice long chat in the parlor?
Hell, baby, I don't know what to say.
That's the way he is.
No. Women're always followin' me 'round.
I'll see you later.
I thought you wasn't comin'.
You know, I been thinkin' - how 'bout us gettin' married?
Yeah. Wouldn't be no picnic for you. I ain't exactly housebroken.
Well, what d'you think?
Duff - you know those women you used to know--
You didn't answer my question.
You still didn't answer my question.
My father's never done a thing for any of them.
Huh?
Hell, baby - I met this beautiful chick and she's just dyin' for me, okay?
What the hell could you do?
I can't stand to see you like that. I know you can't help it.
I don't know. I guess I'm not afraid of them.
What d'you mean?
'Round town.
Take it easy, Frankie.
How 'bout the key?
Man, you must be plumb outa your mind! You'll be makin' twen'y bucks a week, if you're lucky.
'Bye, Jocko.
Wanted a look at your old man, huh?
'Don't sound so sure.
That's right.
What's the matter? Don't smell so good, huh? Must'a broken some records.
I said, she's in great shape.
No thanks, Lee.
No, they won't.
Hell, I'm just like him.
Can't live without trouble, can you?  Nice place you got here. Real nice.
I doubt it.
You can be cocky now, boy. But you won't make it. You won't last. I just feel sorry for Josie. I knew it wouldn't work out.
'Oughta give up smoking, Jocko.
Man, why 'you messin' around with a gal like that? You won't get no place.
How you doin'?  Hi there!
I understand.
That'll make the folks very happy.
What's the matter?! It's a celebration!
If you don't quit it, Will, I'm leaving.
Danny, I can't fucking wait anymore.  You hear me? Now where the fuck's my wife?
Since when?
I will.  Inside.  There's no other way to get the gun off the girl's head, Nate.
Bathroom. But he's nowhere near it.
I'm fine.
No. I only needed the code from you.
My man's coming to get my ass out of here. That's good enough for me.
Of course...
Gettin' in is easy. It's getting out I'm thinkin' of.
Why not?
You've got an expensive razor girl on me for a reason. I'd like to hear what it is.
Put the Sense/Net Police on it. The matrix is their turf.
My days of punching deck are over. For you or anybody else.
Questions make me nervous. Part of our arrangement will be that you don't ask too many.
I don't call this fun, pal. You're playing God with my body.
Then we rendezvous with the final member of our team. For now, that's all you need to know.
I cannot tell a lie. Sorry.
What's he doing to my gear?
What are you talking about?
Can you read my mind?
The words?
Ah, yes... the code. It's a riddle, actually. Some fancy of 3Jane's. Unfortunately, you'll have to find out for yourself. I can no more know that code than I can shut down my own hard wired defences. Now, our time is running short... and you haven't even touched your drink.
It's so easy for you, isn't it? You let Linda Lee die in Chiba City. Now you leave me with Molly, one more lamb to the slaughter. Perhaps it's _your_ soul that should be in question, Mr. Case.
Fine, Ratz. Thanks.
Fine, Dixie. Fine.
Founders of Zion. Builders of Freeside.
The girl 3Jane. We need her.
Can you walk?
You're Dixie McCoy's construct. That makes you something special.
A guy who calls himself Armitage.
Wintermute could have infiltrated that machine. Reprogrammed him.
So it does business through a brain dead marine and runs the stock market for funding. That means Wintermute hired us to fry itself. It doesn't make sense.
No. It's gotta be more than that. That hard wiring also keeps it from getting too smart. Too powerful.
You can make your move when it comes after me.
It's coming.
3Jane's the only person beside Tessier that knows the code.
People are talking. They say the Yakuza has a contract out on you.
This time it's different. Someone ripped of a shipment of hallucinogens. Five grams of liquid ketamine. It was supposed to be Jo Jo's score.
Too many places. You're playing tag wish some kind of death wish, Case.  I'm sorry but I'm not sticking around for the funeral.
Why would you want me to kill you?
Almost two days.
What the fuck... are you serious?
A regular Fagan.
I'll be okay.
Everybody's favourite computer, of course. He may have out calculated the rest of you, but I have certain qualities that don't translate well on microchips.
Try being named after a guitar- playing pussycat.
Professor of medieval literature. Novelist. Weekend flautist.
 uhh, must have forgotten-
Well. I like a man who gets to the point.
I thought this was a 45-minute seminar.
Look. You're way under 30, you're cute, some guys find white Carter's underwear sexy  If you talk to his nose, you don't even notice the eye.
No, thanks--I'm doing this on my own.
It's great! They're behind you. They feel like they know you.
Hidden camera.
Uh uh. I'm Disco Barbie.
Do I want to be crunched?
You're a sick puppy, Geller.
They hid my car--
You're crazy. I can't--I can't-no. No.
You already pitched this to Rigfort?!
But I'm not a penguin.
No, it is. It's just one more thing to add to your "things that make you a better person than me" list.
Gus insists that I become friends with these kids. The popular kids. It's impossible.
Better than I...
Really?
wasn't even thinking about-
Sorry. Forgetful.
Thank you.
Thanks. Wow. That's--really nice to hear.
To put us back together again when we fall.
But now you don't have to--
I did exist. I do exist. I'm the same person!
I don't! Look, you could get to know me, again.
I just can't look at you the same way.
Yeah. Definitely.
Rob, I mean it. I want you to be my first. Me and you. Once the floor stops spinning, let's have sex.
Barrel.
<i>                      Jack said we should work together.</i>
But why?  It's <u>your</u> lunch. There isn't much there in the first place.
<i>                      -- A box? --        Is it steel? --                     Are there locks? -- Is it filled with a pox? --                          A pox! -- How delightful, a pox!</i>
<i>                      -- A bow? --        But why? --                  How ugly! -- What's in it? --                What's in it?</i>
<i>                      Now and forever...</i>
<i>                      Shut up and listen...!</i>
Oh, come on Dad...
And you don't know anything about a murder across the street and a crazy girl who lived here - who saw the whole thing?
Did they tell you she went totally out of her mind - that they had to put her away?  And that her mother killed herself in our living room?
I wasn't sure, Ken...
I want him back.  Jesse, talk to me. Jesse!
He's dead, you bitch.
What about it?
She's a neighbor, I drive her to school.
My Dad.  He played in the minors for a while, when he got out of college.
Listen to me, Grady, this is serious. Something really weird is happening.  It started out like just bad dreams but it's getting real bad.
Look at this car.  Are you kidding?
Yeah.
Who?
Yeah, I know...synapses neurong...
What do you mean?
I don't know.  Concentrate or some- thing.
Maybe it only happens when you're sleeping - that's the way it was with Nancy, wasn't it?
Maybe we can do that.  Strictly scientific, of course.
My Dad thinks I'm on drugs, my Mom thinks I'm crazy and I'm not sure I don't agree with her.
I killed him!  I killed him!
he's just waiting to take me.  When I sleep.
We must look like a couple of escapees from a veterans' hospital.
'Morning, honey.
I know it's warm...  I wish you'd call someone to check out the air conditioning, Ken.
Okay, I guess.
How'd you sleep, honey, okay?
They've gotten worse since I took away her credit cards.
Look, Miss Thompson, I don't know what you want from me.
He's full of shit.
Don't hold your breath.
Research.
Wait and see.
Deal.  Thanks.
No, she's right.
Last time, it was me against him.  I wasn't strong enough...alone.
No fuckin' way.  We're a team.
He's close...
But...it's just a house I've dreamed about.  I dream about it all the time.  Thank you for what you did last night.
I was on the team at school.  I was never very good, though.
You never lose a gift like that.  You just forget how to use it.  How about it?  Will you try?
They sedated me.  We're stuck here till it wears off.
Can't be good news coming from you.
Stay out of my face or I'll go straight to Max.
Fuck off.
But Max, she needs me.  It could mean life or death.
I lost too much over this already.  I'm through with it.
Ever work with vets?  These kids act like they've got D.S.S. -- Delayed Stress Syndrome. If I didn't know better, I'd swear they'd seen heavy combat.
Didn't get much sleep.
Okay...I believe in different levels of conciousness, that sort of thing...but if you're into UFO's or Atlantis, you've lost me.
The nightmares are nothing but a symptom of their real problems.
I'm running out of answers. A patient sleepwalks out of a security ward up to a tower with no access.  A girl, alone in a room, dies by jumping six feet straight up into a television set. Nothing makes sense anymore.
Try me.
And what are they?
You can't!  They'll be defenseless against their dreams.
How do we get in?
What are you talking about?
Cooling down.
There will be no repeat occurences of last night's events.  From now on, your doors will be locked during sleeping hours.  We'll begin a policy of evening sedation.  For everybody.
Accident my ass.  I thought this was supposed to be straight talk in here.
We have to.  I've got to be in New York on Thursday.
Well, they can be.
Fine.
You're welcome and, may I also say... heavenly.
I forgot my bag.
Don't worry about it.  I thought the apricot and honey business was the real lowpoint.
You played it pretty cool here, waiting for three days to call.
And what happens next in the dream?
Yes.
Thank you.  You are 'Horse and Hound's' favorite actress.  You and Black Beauty.  Tied.
I thought you were leaving.
No, that's fine.  I love that you tried... time was I'd have done the same.
I don't know, I'm afraid.
Come in.
Hand it over.  Basic plot?
'Thank you.'  How many mistake did I make?
Yes -- happiness wouldn't be happiness without a violin-playing goat.
It's one hell of a job.  What do you put on your passport?  Profession -- Mel Gibson's bottom.
Who was Gilda?
You're lovelier this morning than you have ever been.
Really?  The entire British press just woke up this morning and thought 'Hey -- I know where Anna Scott is.  She's in that house with the blue door in Notting Hill.'  And then you go out in your goddamn underwear.
I mean -- today's newspapers will be lining tomorrow's waste paper bins.
Well, you know -- it's just one day. Today's papers will all have been thrown away tomorrow.
Okay.
You expect me to tell the truth about my life to the most indiscreet man in England?
I see.  That reality is a real 'no,' isn't it?
I'm sorry.  Is this a problem?
Is that right?
He's cooking guinea fowl?
Right. 
In a depressingly asexual way.
Yes, I think that one may be.
What?
Shame!
Working with Leonardo.
Right.  It's not a classic anecdotes, is it?
Okay.  Tell me, would I have to pay a wet rag as much as I pay you?
No, it doesn't.
Every time.  But don't despair -- I think I have the solution to your problems.
That's not fair.
But I wish to make it clear I've turned a corner and henceforward intend to be impressively happy.
Yes -- she might think you don't have true love on your mind.
Right.  Vicious circle.  And then I was like rooting around in your things, and found this, and I thought -- cool. Kind of spacey.
Ahm let's see -- ahm.  No.  Gone completely.  Oh no, wait.  There was -- one from your mum: she said don't forget lunch and her leg's hurting again.
Well, it was genuinely bizarre... she said, hi -- it's Anna -- and then she said, call me at the Ritz -- and then gave herself a completely different name.
Right.  Right.  You think it's the wrong moment.  Fair enough.  Do you mind if I have a go?
No -- you're right.
Okay -- okay.  Might be too late, but okay.
I suppose I might have told one or two people down the pub.
Yes.
Yes.
What?
So?
I mean, the other day you made an allusion to my wife and the possible sexual problems we might be having. I know that to be the case, but the way in which you broached it, if that's your idea of teaching me something...
I was in luh-love with her.
No! No! No!
Mister McMurphy!
Yes, ma'am.
Yes. Now go along, Mister McMurphy. Go along.
No, that's okay, ma'am. Down it goes.
I wanna report a robbery!
What for?
Well, say. How 'bout springing a pack of cigarettes loose?
Right!
Jesus Christ, the man doesn't want to talk, so get off his back an' let's get on to some new business.
Yeah, yeah, the hell with that crap! The World Series is goin' on right' now an' that's therapy also!
But there are eighteen patients on the ward, Mister McMurphy.
Yes, ma'am?
Please see to Mister Bromden.

Wu-wu-wu I-I-I-I th-th-think sh-sh sh-she's th-th-th-the ma-ma-ma-most bu-bu-bu-beautiful wu-wu-wu-woman in th-th-the whole world!
God Bless America.
Yeah...
It's okay, Rose. You can go with him.
What for?
That okay. I'll take your marker. How many ya want?
Let me get on your shoulders.
Right, Mack!
We'll go back just as soon as we find those guys! 'Kay?
Through the ass.
Me too...
A pecking party?
I don't see you scoring any points, buddy. And you're just the man for the job, right?
You mean you're going to try to pick that thing up and shove it through the window?
With your own two hands?
Okay, Harding, you're on.
What for?
No!
I just started!
I don't trust you!
No!
What's he talkin' about?
Yesterday...
What's this?
Hit me.
Yeah, Mac?
Okay, Martini. That's okay. Now you watch me.
No. Me! Me!
Hold it!
In what way?
Well, according to the Warden at Pendleton, you were a disturbing influence on others. 'It appears that there is a potential in him for instigating a revolt among the other inmates.'  What do you think of that report?
Arrested on an assault charge five times...
The doctor at the prison states: 'Don't overlook the possibility that this man may be faking psychosis to escape the drudgery of the work farm...' What do you say to that?
Ah, it seems you have no other psychiatric history, Mister Murphy?
Well, you're here for a ninety-day observation period, Mister McMurphy. I'd like you to understand you are here on a court order and we are responsible to the state. So, I'd like your cooperation!
I want you to write me a letter to my brother for a hundred dollars to bury me.
Yeah, you don't know how to get outta this place!
Shhh!  This way!
He can't hear you. He's just a deaf and dumb Indian!
'Kay...
Come an' see.
Yeah, that's a good idea, Turkle. Why don't ya take Rose on a little tour of our facilities...
Okay. How you doing?
No...
Oh, yeah...
Hit, you say? Well well well and with a king up, the boy wants a hit. Whadaya know. So comin' at you and too bad, a little lady for the lad and he's over the wall and down the road, up the hill and dropped his load.
Why, my head would just squash like an eggplant, McMurphy.
I don't have any.
After you, ma'am.
Tha's your problem.
Huh?
Now you talkin'.
Why, sure, ma'am...
Jus' cleanin' up, ma'am.
Yes, ma'am...
Yes, ma'am...
What's that?
Shhh, please, Miss. Keep it down...
I thought so.
Yes, but...  He was having an affair.
I-- I must've misplaced it.
Buona notte.
So.  How do we get to Rome?
Really.  She thinks he's here. Even though she's never met him. Even though she's never laid eyes on him.
I've never been more sure of anything in my life.
Except possibly that.
Don't be stupid, Larry.  If he's my destiny, then, obviously, he has to be alive.
But, Faith--
But Faith--
I take it things didn't work out between the two of you?
Non.  Please.
I'm on my way to Venice.  Why?
I'm in love with you.
Look, Peter, I don't hate you. But what we had was an illusion. Mutual wishful thinking.  We both wanted to believe it for awhile, but it was all founded on a lie.
Just to that place down at the bottom of the stairs.  Nothing fancy.
What are you doing here?
I don't know if that's such a--
Actually, I think I prefer Katherine Hepburn.
I feel like the world's biggest idiot.
Are you asking me out?
You want a hint?  I'll give you a hint.  You are the lowest, most despicable, most reprehensible form of reptilian swine--
A "little white lie"?  A "little white lie"?
Yes.
I brought you that, too.
Uh huh.
Beautiful place...
You would?  Really?
Yes?
What?
Yeah.  He's around somewhere.
You're an accountant for cryin' out loud.
Oh.
I don't know, Kate.
I know...  It was.
Yeah.  I guess you're right.  I really like the wallpaper we picked out for the den.
No...  I can just tell.
But it's July.
You don't have a passport.
Does Dwayne know about this?
Well, we're here.  And more importantly, he's here.  We'll cut back on everything else.
You gave it your best shot.  You tried.
Did I or did I not offer to have it cleaned?
The guy at the desk said he only left about a half hour ago, right?
So, maybe his room hasn't been cleaned yet.  Maybe there's something in there that might help us.  Maybe they'll let us go in and take a look around.
What is it?
'Course he does.
And you know what I thought then, Kate?  I thought, I hope someday I have somebody who loves me that much.  I still hope that.
Her brother.
I don't know.  I just asked her if she knew him and all of the sudden--
Sure you did.
Okay, okay.  You join him.  But first will you ask if he's here?
I meant about my idea.
I know, but...
You sure you'll be okay?
I thought this was supposed to be the one guy in the world you wouldn't need to change.
And Larry?...
He's gone.  He told me what happened.  He just left for the airport.
A pig!  A pig!  She's saying he's a pig.
Giovanni.
That's exactly what you are.
No.
We're all desperate for the money, doll.  That's what made this country great.  Back me up on this Candy, am I right?
Went to high school with him. But...
She went out to check into skywriting.  I can't believe you lied.  Is this a genetic thing, men will say anything just to get laid?
Mania.
Ten billion to one.
I'd get over there, Terry. I'll take the little lady home.
You know Johnny when he gets mad.
We was robbed last night and we can't find no books.
So look, kid, you don't think we c'n afford to be boxed out of a deal like this a deal I sweated and bled for on account of one lousy little cheese-eater, that Doyle bum, who thought he c'd go squealin' to the Crime Commission? Do you?
Gimme.
So they're walking along and smiling. That doesn't mean he's going to talk. There's no evidence until he gives public testimony.
So do I, Charley. For your sake.
Very simple. Just bring him to... that place we been using. Mac, you take care of the details. Call Gerry G. in if you think you need him.
Confused kid? First he crosses me in public and gets away with it and then the next joker, and pretty soon I'm just another fellow down here.
That was the idea.
I just fnished work. I counted the bags.
Nolan? I knew he had guts but
You know, the boys are getting rather interested in your future.
And for all that dough I don't do nothin'?
I know. I know.
Don't say that!
You think I'm just a gravy-train rider in a turned-around collar?
How would you've done it?
What-what? Where you been the last four five years? Outer space?
How do you like it?
Describing you. A square from out there. I mean you're nowhere.  Miss Four Corners.
What do they do for you, except get in your way?
Why keep harpin' on it?  Come on, drink up. You got to get a little fun out of life. What's the matter with you?  I'll play you some music.
I thought I felt mean tonight. But I'm not I'm just all mixed up... .
It's fun dancing with your eyes closed. I'm floating. I'm floating... .
Why should I come hollering to you at all?
I can't let myself fall in love with you.
I won't eat cheese for no cops, that's for sure.
I'm tryin' to keep you from being hurt What more do you want?
Go ahead, wear it.
I didn't say I didn't love you. I said stay away from me.
I'm looking for Charley. I heard Charley was waiting for me.  Charley?
I mean it, let's get away from here, first Joey then Nolan, now Charley and any minute... .  ...I'm frightened I'm frightened.
I don't want to see you killed. I want to live with you. Live with you. Any place it's safe to walk the streets without... .
Are you sure they're your friends?
You heard what Johnny said. No part of the Waterfront'll be safe for you now. Maybe inland the Middle West somewhere a job on a farm... .
You always said I was a bum. Well  not anymore. I'm going down to the dock. Don't worry, I'm not going to shoot anybody. I'm just going to get my rights.  Joey's jacket. It's time I start wearing it.
Terry...?
You are like
Let me by.
Someone else c'n take your confession.
A question of who rides who.
You got eyes. I'm right in front of you.
Why don't you go and chase yourself?
Johnny Friendly is layin' odds that you won't get up.
If I stick my neck out, and they chopped it off, would that be the end of it? Or are you ready to go all the way?
Down to the wire?
You know what you're askin'? You're askin'
You want to know something I would have taken Wilson
Oh me and my chum are just rolling in the stuff. We only work down here for a hobby, J.P. 
I told you lay off.
Be sure they got enough water.
Hit me again.
Naw, thanks, Johnny, I don't want it, I
It was a big nothing! The Father did all the talking.
You mean Kayo Nolan, the old timer? He doesn't know much.
Now just a minute, I
You ratted on us, Terry.
When we knock off let's have a bit of a party. We'll drink to God and Ireland, its whiskey and its women, to Joey and Edie  and death to tyrants everywhere... .!
Keep Charley out of this.
Sure there are--and I've tried them all.  Plays, love stories, westerns, dog stories.  Huh, now there was a good one, that dog story all about--
That's life.  My kisses are alive.
Where?
What help can we possibly find in the cemetery at this time of night?
It's an initiation all right, but not of a college as you and I know them.  Nothing alive looks like that!
You've got a right to be. We're trapped by a bunch of fiends.
Be careful!
Nothing is worth your life.
Oh, no I'm not.  These heathens probably have an open grave for us.
I should hope not.  I hate you!
My old boyfriend Tommy would never have gotten me in a mess like this.  At least <i>he's</i> got brains.
Maybe so.
Of course I do.
A situation easily remedied.
Now, I will talk...to The Wolf Man...and The Mummy.
I will decide the conclusion.
Then cancel my order.
Well rest easy, I'm not angry with either of you.
You are the keepers of the Damned.  You two know them all. And I am tired of this usual type of entertainment. I want...a decided change.
I repulse you?  Very well.  It seems you have chosen your own fate. Live with it!  I should say <b>die</b> with it!
Aahhhhnnnaaahahnn. AaaaaahhhhoooWWWOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
Aannnnaahhnn.
Didn't you tell me one-time calls aren't monitored?
What's free about it?  I'm looking for work.
And the one driving the other car?
Well, seeing as you have so much luck with cars, Buddy thought it might be better to bring two.  He got this guy he says you know from Lompoc, Glenn something.
You do the sawing of the box in half trick with you inside?
Tell me, how do you do that?
You mean, did he try to jump me?  No, but he was kind of talkative.
He didn't want me to.
Till they got busted.
Oh.  Uh-huh.
I brought 'em, they're back at Glades in the Cadillac.  You wanted to take her car.
He ain't the problem, Jack.
Cause she had her hand on her gun the whole time, waiting to make her move.
There's some lilac oil, you want some, a vanilla candle under the sink.
He's running for his life, he doesn't give a shit about you.
Now you're talkin'.
He isn't fighting no more.  Glenn told me the Snoop's been managing some guys up there now, works out at the Kronk.
I think Glenn opened his big mouth and now we got us another partner.
Two hours.
Who says anybody's gonna be with us? I say we go to the fights tomorrow, find out what the Snoop's big plan is, then go in ahead of those guys -- <u>alone</u>.
Tell me something, Buddy.  You know anyone who's actually done one last big score and gone to live the good life?  Cause it occurred to me that everyone <u>talks</u> about doing it, but I don't know anyone who's actually gone and <u>done</u> it.  Do you?
I saw Karen Sisco.
You know how I felt about her.
It wasn't about getting laid.  I just wanted to know what might've happened if things were different.
Half for doing what?
And who watches your back?
All you gotta do is get in.
I'll go with you.
Oh... different things, prison, movies.
When I was seeing Carl Tillman, I didn't know he robbed banks.
Have you ever shot a man?  How many times have you been primary through the door?
You wouldn't shoot me, would you?
Yeah.  And I thought everyone liked Eddie.
Company, shit.  I watch the man's back.
Thirty-two outta what, twenty?
We're leaving.
I thought everything.
I wasn't asking permission.
Shit, yeah.  White Boy even got busted for it.  White Boy, tell these boys the reason you went down on that burglary that time.
I've seen 'em used on TV.
In my bag, in the car.
I believe it.  You've ruined a nine- hundred-dollar suit my dad gave me.
The idea of going after guys like you appealed to me.
Jack Foley.  You've probably heard of me.
Time I was convicted in California? FBI told me I'd robbed more banks than anyone in the computer.
I thought so, too.
They put a hundred and eighty-seven bullet holes in Clyde, Bonnie Parker and the car they were driving.  Bonnie was eating a sandwich.
Shit...
Really.  He has a cop's face.
And your gun.
Because you're having too much fun.
I just thought maybe you and me could--
I'm a sales rep.  I came here to call on a customer and they gave me a hard time because I'm a girl.
What, as a sales rep?
I had one just like it -- well, it was the same idea, but I had to get rid of it.
No.  What do you do for a living, Gary?
So do you.
He killed a police officer.
Don't talk like that, okay?  You scare me.
I'm trying not to.  I just wanna know what's gonna happen.
You're in civilization now, man, ease up.
Why?  Just because you left us standing on the side of the road?
You know who they are?
Oh, uh, right, thanks...
No?  Where do you keep it, Dick?  I'm talking about all those uncut diamonds you told Glenn about.
You're the one with balls, Dick, say something like that to someone like Glenn.  Or maybe you just forgot where you were for a minute.
Twenty-two months, three days, two hours.  Why?
Who is?  But then you gotta look at a job as more than just work.  You gotta look at it as peace of mind.  As <i>security</i>, you know what I mean?  I got offices in Detroit, Miami, Boston, take your pick.
First, I'm goin' to Israel for a year, study the Talmud, work on a Kibbutz... then come back, maybe take some tennis lessons.
Siddown, Dick.  They're trying to open the safe, not your maid.
Cheaper I guess, take us both down in one van.
Like what?
I remember you now.  Shit.
We're not.  I'm helping him, yeah--
He's supposed to be, but he hasn't shown up yet, which is a good thing for him.
Maurice is gonna kill him, try and collect the reward.
Really?
I know, you'll find me.  Jesus, I believe it.  I keep thinking if you hadn't driven me to federal court last summer, you wouldn't even know who I am.
Studs.  Hey, son, you must be one a them psychic friends.  I was just thinkin' about you.
You crazy, come up <u>here</u>?  It's fuckin one degree outside.
Oh, I'm here, all right.  I'm very here. Question is, why aren't <u>you</u> here?
Me?
Oh...
Thanks.
You a lawyer?
Something better.  Open it.
You used to like it.
We don't get to talk much any more.
Off a tip?
Not at all.
Foley <i>kid</i>napped me.
It's possible.  Why?
He knew what he was doing.  Nobody forced him to rob banks.
I don't have any idea.
Like a fag.
The combination is three-ten-forty-four.
Well, I need that...
Yeah.  Sure.  It's all settled.
Are they dead?
Ooo, she's thinking of her date!  Come on, you've been dating a pilot.  We want to know what we can expect.
Red...Strange?
But...they called you Strange?  Because of Red Grange?  I don't get it.  Was Red Grange strange?
Yes Sir.
Where's that lizard?
Well, you p-puked on his feet.
You guys get those!  Earl, Rafe, come with me!
I have to talk to Evelyn.  And I want you to meet her.
Yeah.
It's a test.  If I asked her to come and she came, it wouldn't tell me anything. If I tell her not to come, and she comes...then I know she loves me.
Sure you did.  So come on.  Say what you think.
You don't wanna put beer over mai-tai.
You left her.  How's that for a fact?
I guess I'm used to it.  I've felt like throwing up every minute since you got back.
Fuck you.
Yeah.  So you can call me if you need help.
I'm out of fuel!
Bullshit.  We've played with each other, pushed each other.  This is different. Like you want to prove that you're better than me.  Who's that for -- Evelyn?
What's between you and her is between you and her.  But here's what's between you and me.  Everybody has a hero, Danny. And you're mine.
Longer?  It's getting shorter.
Home of the Brave.
We got a saying here.  A-low-HA!
He told me about you.  That he had no other friend like you.
You were more like brothers.
How could it be irresponsible, Sir, if you were the first man in the world to do it?
Thank you, Sir.
We can explain, Colonel.
Wait, let me look at that... You better come in here.
Yes'm.
Tell me something, Dorie.  A man as big as you -- and smart too, you knew where to come when your ship couldn't help -- do you still have to fight with your fists to get respect?
You too, Lieutenant.
You waited til tonight to tell me?
There's nothing you can do here, they'll die or they won't, we just --
It was.  I couldn't have you go away, wherever it is...to war...without knowing something.  You think I made a choice, of Danny over you.  I didn't.  I didn't have a choice.  I'm pregnant.
We have a fighter screen up, in case we are attacked, Admiral.
The second wave has not returned.  And we have no idea where their carriers are. What is the damage report?
God help them.
Crank her!
The Americans themselves have made it possible.  We will annihilate them in a single attack -- at Pearl Harbor.
I've already got some in. I was thinking of making a pie for dinner tonight.  How would you like that?
Goodbye, Grandma.
I hope so. At least I got to see you and Grandma.  Has it ever worked before?
How do you like my hair?
Not from the guy with the lowest prices in town.
You're probably the only one who could carry it off.
We did for a long time. We just got married too young, and ended up blaming each other for missing out on things.
Come on. What's with you and Michael?
That loudmouthed little bitch~
That's disgusting!
Yeah. Come on Charlie, turn it off.
I call this the staccato. 
Refresh my memory.
Thanks.
I thought it had a lot of merit.
Rejected, worthless, miserable.
Good.
Is he gonna help you with that physics stuff?
Hey! Who needs physics when we've got chemistry?
Who?
Save it.
Let's go down to the basement.
You know I never could stand your sarcasm.
And why do you always refer to yourself in the third person, like Napoleon? How come it always turns into an argument with you?
That won't make any difference. We just can't live together. And you had the nerve to drive up with that bimbo Janet.
I'm trying to save you years of frustration... waiting for a big break... no. Waiting for that big disappointment so you could blame it all on me.
It means I care about you and what happens to you.
Okay. Listen, I cancelled the tickets for Fabian. I thought it would be better for your birthday to eat at a nice restaurant, Chez Tres.
Right here. Now sit down.
Don't try to charm me, Charlie Bodell.
First of all, Richard is not a creep. He happens to be an exceptional person. If any of you gave him half a chance, you'd find that out.
Oh! You did that on purpose! I hate you. Go gargle with razor blades!
Okay.
What, why?
That's a day's work. But if that's what you want, maybe we can do it tomorrow for your birthday.
I wish she hadn't.
He's very interesting. For all his pretending to be a tough guy, he's really got the soul of a poet.
He's a fisherman! The most overrated writer of the century. I mean, he's the perfect American author  fat, violent, drunk...
What are you shooting for?
They care about you. They're just a different generation.
Is that one of your poems?
For everyone.
That's a terrific line. You're going to be a wonderful writer.
Peggy Sue's still stuck on treble without a cause.
What?
Just a little. I've had a tough day.
I think I'm way ahead of them.
It's not Charlie. It's me.
Calm down. Just listen for a minute.. Please.
Listen Dad, please. Buy IBM, buy Polaroid, buy Apple Computer. No, no. Not yet. Buy Xerox!
Don't worry, it's just a seasonal slump.
What's the matter? Did you two have a fight?.
I'm sorry about that. I really want us to be closer. I have enough unresolved relationships in my... life.
What was?
I	know what a burrito is.
I don't know.
Come on, Richard, I'm serious.
Sixtyforty.
When do we start?
I think it's called silicon. Charlie told me that.
Yes, every day.  Maybe I shouldn't have worn that dress? I told Beth it was a bad idea. That's why they made me Queen.
Did you break up with Charlie?
I... um...
Pretty much so.
I suppose so.
Not this dog. There wasn't enough oxygen in those red cells to pump life into a flea.
He's probably going up to the Pet Sematary. Kids've been going out there on Halloween night for years.
You alright?
"Out." Well that's great, Geoff.  Look, I've been letting you get away with a lot these past few weeks, but I'm not going to stand for crap like this. I don't care if it's Halloween... it's a school night, and if you do this again...
I'm not hungry.
I can bring her back. The same way Drew and me brought Zowie back...
All set.
Anywhere but here.
I'm not trying to prove anything.  I was burying my dog.
Say your goodbyes. Zowie's going outside. You're grounded, buddy. That's the new law.
Zowie.
Nothing. It's just an old ghost story. Let's get out of here...
I'm not burying him here...
You never get over it.
You think he'd believe it if he did?
All the time.
Right here, Mom...
Sorry...
One hour!
Yes. I think it will be a simple solution. They'll put it in a syringe, inject it into your bloodstream. It'll neutralize the virus. It'll revitalize the immune system, and people with AIDS will become healthy again.
Fuck you. This shit's probably not doing me any good anyway.
The least you can do is look at me, while I'm sticking this shit into your arm. Forget the fucking case, one hour a day, and give me a little of your time.
Maybe you should think about it.
Do you think I'm ready for it?! I hate this shit. I'm not a fucking martyr! I hate every goddamn part of it!
Ready for what, baby?
I'm seeing him this afternoon.
Sounds delightful.
He's upset, he's sorry.
One week old.
You want to sue Wyant Wheeler Hellerman Tetlow and Brown?
Your... lover?
Makeup.
I'm a lawyer. How's your baby?
One of the partners spotted a lesion on my forehead.
We're friends of Beckett's.
Beer.  We need to go over your Q and A.
Thanks.  Do you like opera?
Want to hear my favorite aria?
What impressed you about him?
It's possible I was infected with the HIV virus at that time, but I wasn't diagnosed until several years later.
I suppose you could say that.
You don't bring your personal life into a law firm. You're not supposed to <u>have</u> a personal life, really. Anyway, I did plan to tell Charles, eventually. But then, this thing happened at the tennis club...
It was good working with you, Andrew. You're welcome.  Hey. Shouldn't you put that thing back on?
I guess it was 1984, 85.
As a homosexual, one is often forced to conceal one's sexuality, is that right?
Thank you.
I'm fine.
Ancient. How do you think I feel? Put that thing down and give me a hug.  Andrew, stop! ... He still doesn't listen.
Yes. I'm now in charge of the paralegal department.
Is that a question?
Well... One time, Mr. Wheeler's secretary, Lydia, told me Mr. Wheeler had a problem with my earrings.
What did you say?
Fact. Andrew Beckett performed at a consistently mediocre level. Fact. He made a grievous error on a multi-million dollar lawsuit... Fact. He claims he is the victim of lies and deceit. Fact. Andrew Beckett lied to his employers, going to great efforts to conceal his disease from them. Fact. He was successful in his duplicity. The partners at Wyant Wheeler did <u>not</u> know Andrew Beckett had AIDS when they fired him...
I'll rephrase.  Did you have anything to do with this file being... misplaced?
Wyant Wheeler represented us.
It satisfied me.
You're in trouble.
In a word, yes.
What kind of people?
Second.
We ought to be suing him.
Charles...
Bob. I must ask you to shut the fuck up. Did Andrew Beckett say "I might not be able to serve our clients to the <u>best of my ability</u>?" He said nothing. And now, Andrew Beckett proposes to haul me into a court of law, to sling accusations at me, in full view of the entire, Philadelphia, judicial establishment. My God.
Charles...
<u>What</u>?
You sure you can keep --
We can't make it.
You're fuckin' with me. I know you are.
But I'm human. I know you view that as a weakness, but I'm sorry -- I <u>do</u> feel fear, theirs too. Goddamnit, Riddick -- yes. I would die for them.
It's starting....
Big Evil?
Be my choice. Already escaped once from the max-slam facility on --
Only around humans.
Fuck. Guess I'm more glad to be here than I thought.
What?
Ease up, ease up. JOHNS! Just tell me what....
Sir Shiv-a-lot. He likes to cut.
Hey. Bein' ballsy with your life now doesn't change what came before -- it's just stupid.
You said it, not me. Let's just not let one bad call lead to another.
Nothing we can't repair -- so long as the electrical adapts.
Let's wait on the power cells.
That's what I said.
I never said I was.
Anything <u>else</u> we should know about you, Johns? Christ, here I am lettin' you play games with our lives when --
You coulda helped. And you didn't.
Oh, don't use her like that, for a smoke screen.
79 kilos.
We're just burnin' light here.
I don't get it, Johns. What is so goddamn valuable in your life that you're worried about losing? Huh? Is there anything at all? Besides your next hype?  Got no right to be so scared. Neither one of us.
Riddick. <u>Riddick</u>.
I was wrong. I admit it. My bad, okay? Now let's just go back to the ship.
Ask if anyone has anything in cargo! Anything to drink!
What, you're goin' off, too?
He's dead. Cap'n's dead. Christ, I was looking right at him when --
And there wasn't a simulated cockroach alive within 50 clicks of the simulated crash site! <u>That's</u> how they train you! On a fucking simulator!
70 seconds! You still got 70 seconds to level this beast out!
You know who Muhammad was?
And what about the cells?
He will be with us. Nonetheless.
Get the girl back under. Keep going.
KEEP GOING OR I WILL!
The child heard you before any of us could even....
Maratha crow-bill war-picks from Northern India. Very rare.
We're movin'. And I'm just wondering if I shouldn't lighten the load right now.
Say that again.
Not afraid of the dark, are you?
I'm willing to take a cut in pay.
Hard to tell, sometimes...even for me... but looked like a bunch of those big boys chewin' each other's gonads off. Thought we'd swing wide. Okay by you?
Kept calling it "murder" when I did it.
What, you 'spect <u>me</u> to do it?
Maybe they had weight limits, you don't know.
You know Dr. Maximus, our Commissioner for Animal Affairs?
That's correct. And you will both stand trial for heresy.
Do you have any weapons?
Right now, if you like.
Oh, Cornelius, be quiet.
No, they won't -
It's probably wrong --
The evidence was very meager --
Zira, listen to me. We've got a fine future ahead of us. Marriage. Stimulating careers. I'm up for a raise --
There was one bad moment -- some hunters stopped us.
Yo!
Any sign of dangerous ionization?
None at all.
Well, Dr. Zira? This is a man, is he not?
Come to the point, Dr. Honorius.
Sustained.  Your archeological theories have no bearing on the disposition of this creature.
Good morning, Julius. How's our patient today?
Don't be silly. He's perfectly tame.
Well, you know what they say. Human see, human do.
We're here to stay.
Taylor.	I'm telling you --
Try telling them our names.
If you insist. But I'm not taking any orders --
I'm for that.
In my world -- before I left it - only youngsters of your age wore un- scraped hair.
I think you're making a mistake.
He wouldn't leave her.
Why special?
My name is Taylor.
Read it yourself.
With one of them.
I take it you don't believe the prosecutor's charge -- that I'm a monster created by Dr. Zira.
All right, suppose I am a mutant? Why does the appearance of one mutant send you into a panic?
Okay.Up to the cave.
That's lunacy. I can give an alternate description for everyone of those objects that's equally as inventive as yours. But it would be conjecture, not proof.
Of course, you could return with us. Our society might find a place for you and your mate.
Because you are a man. And you were right -- I have always known about man. From the evidence, I believe his wisdom must walk hand in hand with his idiocy. His emotions must rule his brain. He must be a warlike animal who gives battle to everything around him -- even himself.
A hearing.
Taylor -- just keep quiet and we may get away with this. Remember that men all look alike to most apes.
You're going back to the Forbidden Zone?
Maybe not.
She's not sick at all.  She's pregnant.
Wasn't I humiliated? By all of you? Didn't you lead me around on a leash?
Sirs: our theories have a bearing on his identity.
In a few minutes there will be no doll. There can't be.  I'm sorry.
YOU - you're going to fuckin' jail, buddy, you ain't getting away with this one!!!!!
Don't tell me how to fight this fucking war, 'Lias, you go crying to fucking brigade on your time. Out here you belong to me. Now move.
De fool think he's gonna get it but he ain't known for his thinking.
Yeah if you let me have your shirt.
Don you worry Bunny, youse a killer anyway.
Sure, you probably stick it in tween her knees and think youse there.
Barnes comes from Hell.
I got one...
Out there man - behind the log.
No!
She was a crossbreed, Chinese and Polish.
Dawn...
Do you believe that stuff about... knowing you're gonna die?
Fuck it, don't mean nothing, no such thing here as a coward, done your best man, next time y'do better.
What are the heads?
You a crazy fucker, givin' up college man.
They don't know shit Barnes, and chances are we gonna run into something.
Knock it off! We got two men need attention here. Police up your extra ammo and frags, don't leave nothing for the dinks. Hoyt, Junior, carry Gardner.
They're on their way...  There's a gook village half a klik downriver, Battalion wants us to move in and search it ASAP, something's going on... where's Barnes?
This ain't Taylor. Taylor been shot. This man Chris been resurrected...
Barnes gets killed, his jaws'd go on clacking...
He dugged his own grave.
Bah, you're a child, Lerner. Rhah don't waste time on you.
That's what he is... Baaaa!
Jackson, looks like you got Elias' squad now.
This is one time we could sure use Elias.
Well..

I'm sure you have.
Perhaps I'd better get you straightened out, Mr. Mitchell. You've been rather nice to me, in a couple of ways. And I'm grateful. But I don't think this entitles you to put me on a leash.
I'm trying very hard to be polite about it.
Why certainly, baby.
How careful should I be?
Just drunk enough.
Possibly, Miss.
I don't need it that badly. I don't enjoy crashing other people's parties.
No.  Are you really going to drink that stuff?
I can be talked out of it. As a matter of fact, I'd like a dry Martini myself.
No thank you.
Much too late.
What's funny about that? If you pick up people like Larry Mitchell other people are bound to get funny ideas about you. The world is full of Larry Mitchells.
No thanks.
That's putting it mildly.
So there is. You don't want to go to bed. I don't want to go to bed. Let's go somewhere and hear some music--have something to drink-- something to eat--even dance.
Let's not pretend Mitchell meant anything to either of us.
Just who are you, anyway?
I'm different. I like it fine.
They know you here--know your name.
Absolutely sure.
Take me home--and forget you ever saw me. That's a silly remark isn't it?
No percentage in that.
How bad is the other thing?  The secret?
And Betty Mayfield--
Killaine...
And I'm begging for my life--and yours.
If it has to be--do you mind if I do it myself?  Oh, I don't mean with the gun. This is no trick.  When I wrote that note you have in your pocket-- that was no trick either.  It's not so hard for me as you think. I'm not crying about it, I've been skating close to it for quite some time.  The water is cold down there--  But so is everything else.  And there's you.
It is?
Regimental! Seaforth Highlanders.
Stop saying you're sorry. I want information, not regrets.
The police always do, don't they?
Because you think your in love with me?
To do what?
Goodbye, Betty.
All right. Get him.
Who's Goble?
Quit trying to scare me, Mr. Brandon, I'm neurotic.
If I call the police, your price will go down to a minus sign.
For two hundred?
A thousand.
In the same elevator. It is a public conveyance.
Martini.
Sometimes.
Yes, I've seen it before.
I rather thought so. And before that, had you ever seen the gun?
Delightfully. Every time Miss Mayfield says something, I know less than I did before.  Well, I may as well knock off for tonight.  Good night, Miss Mayfield. Do let me thank you for your cooperation.
If it doesn't take too long.  Drink?
Don't kid me.  You don't think she murdered Mitchell.
That COULD BE TOLD.
What?
Oh.  That was just one of those idle questions.  One doesn't expect an answer.
I see out friend Larry Mitchell is with us again.
I don't think you locked your door.
How clumsy. I'd never forgive myself. Good night my dear.
With what motive?
You're the waterfront specialist. Find out about it.  I've got a murder to investigate.
One of those nice long manila envelopes--sealed.  Not too fat- not too thin.
Open it and count it.
So the wound and the shell give you the same answer.
I'll know when I find it.
I think so.
Did we ever really think it was suicide?
I was in love with him... which shows you the quality of my brains.  Why don't you ask her about the gun?
It was Clarendon.  He knew I had the gun in my bag.
I'll investigate Mr. Clarendon's financial position--
Perhaps a rich widow would have solved all his problems.
How about Magruder?
Try Betty Mayfield.  The Mitchell case.
I hear she's a very pretty girl.
When I give an order, you'll not need it interpreted.  You have an hour to make your mind up.  Well, are ye satisfied, Mr. Mitchell?
A little of both, sir, and perhaps not quiet enough of either.
Two.
Nor I. This is why I gave it to you.
With your charm? How could I help it? Have a nice trip?
Nice.
She's very beautiful. She's much younger than I am. And she's rich, I hope.
You ought to know why.
You don't have to make a pose of it.
I seem to recognize this routine. First the kiss then the touch.  Oh, what's the use. You're you.
That's not very kind.
What does it look like?
Oh, forget it. Clark Brandon's throwing a party up in his penthouse this evening. Take me?
How about your new friend?
Unsophisticated?  If I knew about this babe...
It's kind of you to see me.
What a shame.
To James.  I remember what it was I was going to say.  We were talking about forgetfulness.  The Czech writer Kundera has one of his characters say that the struggle of man against tyranny is the struggle of memory against forgetting.
Well, I'd hate to be a nuisance.
What went wrong?
It needn't concern you, Edward. James has got some news.  He needs a poet's advice.
...break away completely from--
I'd want to set out events as they happened.  The way I see it is this: the British Empire was an ideal.  It may have become totally obsolete by the middle of this century, but it wasn't totally dishonourable to try and defend its remains and try and salvage some self-respect, which is what I think the Conservatives were trying to do.  Then there's the essential--
Yes, please.
Thank you.
Freshman and sophomores...
Like I was saying, the American angle in Suez is very important. I wouldn't want to say they let us down.  I think that's wrong.  A good ally is one who doesn't back you up in your mistakes, who tells you when to pull back.  And the Americans were good allies.  Simple as that.
I quite liked it.  I wasn't as enthusiastic as everyone else.
You don't like flashbacks because your mother's a historian.
Both dead.
Who?
Yes, if you like.  Call me at work.
I might.
I know.  I'm sorry.
The Argies.
Come on.  Hand over.
Let me see.
Jeremy, just let me see what you've got.
You're so gross.
Sorry.  Got held up.  What are you doing here?
She said awfully sorry, make yourself comfortable, she won't be long. .
She's not my mother, anyway.  My mother's in Italy.
All right.
Fifteen news items.  I got exactly the same running order as the bulletin desk.  They're all old pros.
The bed's all made up if you want to stay.
Now listen...
Oh no!
You'd look naked without one.
Promise?
They're punks.  Nazis.  Their brains are wired wrong.  They hurt surfing because they give nothing back, and they have no respect for the sea. They just want to get radical.  It's mindless aggression.  They'll never get it, the spiritual side of it.
A flaw I'm working on.
News, last night... those guys, the Ex-Presidents... they robbed my bank yesterday.  And I was just there the day before, cashing a check.  See... look.  Assured Trust... same place.
Sure, it's a blast, but listen, I sorta screwed up my knee yesterday--
So, who... uh, who packed my chute?
Sorry, can't do it, brah.  He's on the road.  And where they're going there's no phones.  Damn, I hate this Johnny, I really do.  I hate violence.  See, that's why I need Rosie.  I could never make this thing work, myself.  No way I could hold a knife to Tyler's throat, man! She was my woman, once.  We shared time in this world.  But Rosie, he's kind of a... mechanism.  Once you set him in motion, he won't stop. That's his gift, a kind of... blankness.  Noon comes, straight up, he'll gut her like a pig and try not to get any on his shoes.  Nothing I can do, unless I get there.
Around somewhere.  Listen, I'm in kind of a hurry, Johnny U.  What can I do for you?
SHIT!!
Zero distortion, sir.
Not so far.
Caught my first tube this morning.
Take your hand off my shoulder right now.
The shit they pull, huh?
Never go for the vault.  They never get greedy.
Well, what're your ideas on these guys?
The lab made three possible matches, this was one of 'em.
Thanks, buddy.
Remember, all bank robbers are losers, but not all losers are bank robbers.
He's pushing it through first thing. You better get some sleep tonight, it could be an interesting morning.
Cole and Munoz are going in the back door.  Babbit is backing me.  So I want you at the side window by the hedge.  You're strictly backup, got it?
Angelo, we gotta talk.
This Zen master surfer.
Look, we handle it ourselves, for right now, okay?  We cover the bank, whatever.  You and me.  That way if nothing happens, or more accurately, when nothing happens... I don't get my tits any further into the wringer than they already are.
Angelo, it's eleven thirty.
They took a left at the next light!
Well, I'm just gonna go back out there till I catch on to it or break my neck.
Sure.
He rents it for the summer.  Bodhi always gets some slick place and throws it open to every surf burnout around.  Most a these guys can't keep a job.  When the swell comes, they're gone, they have to ride.
People are expendable to Bodhi.
We went out for about five minutes... which is four minutes longer than most of them.  But you can't hold it against him, he's... different.
What are you talking about?
Johnny... what's going on?  I don't get it... did I do something?
Carefully, tough guy.  Very carefully.
What about the rest of Hopper's men?
The wound all fused, cauterized... what the hell did this?
Now what, Dutch. You going to send your mystery guest an invitation?
Right behind you.
I saw it.
I'll take him.
The best friend I ever had.
What's that, General?
He knows our defenses.
Twenty-five percent.
I see.  Well.  Maybe that means you'd have lunch with me sometime then.
What?
Okay, what <u>ho</u>tel?
Day jobs, yeah.  I've tried them.  Turn right.
Why?
Can I have some chips?
I dunno... you have that sharp, useless look.
Oooh, thank god.
Just a romantic, that's you.
Yeah.  Too good.  I forgot where I was.
Mmm, I could tell.
C'mon, I might buy a company some day.
Look butthead, I'll treat you so nice you'll never want to let me go, okay?
It's very tasteful.  I think you'll especially like the zipper in the crotch.  I'm -- joking.
No, I don't "got it".  Even the farmboys back in Georgia come to the door when they're taking you on a date.
I thought I told you not to answer the phone.
I had a little problem in one store.  I wasn't dressed right. I don't know what to say.  I don't belong there.  Maybe I'll just go back to Bridget.  She was cool.
Thank you.  I would.  Nice.
Easier than learning how to be poor.  My father's family was wealthy. When I was young there were cars and houses, private schools, nannies.  But then my father divorced my mother to marry another woman.  And he took his money with him.
Not much to tell.  I went to public school.  Went to university on scholarship.  Went to work for an investment firm. In eight years I owned it.  My father was chairman of the board of the third company I ever went after.  I swallowed that company and shit out the pieces. One of the pieces was him.
I really doubt anyone here frequents Hollywood Boulevard.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Your goddamned friend, he thinks the only reason I'm with you is for the money.
Where are you taking me!?
When I was a little girl, my mother locked me in the attic when I was bad, which was pretty often. I'd stare out the window up there and make believe I was a princess trapped in the tower by the wicked queen.  Then suddenly a knight on a white horse with his bright colors flying would ride up. Rescue me from the tower, and then we'd ride off... but never, ever in all the times I had that dream did the knight say, "Come on baby, I'll put you up in a great condo."
What do you mean?
It was good.
Stay with me tonight.  Not because you're being paid to. Stay with me because you want to.
My what?
Eight o'clock.  Kross is bringing his son.  Very bright kid, watch yourself with him.  Who's this girl you're taking?
Vivian's in sales.
Industrial espionage is not ridiculous.  Edward, how do you know she hasn't attached herself to you so she can bring Kross back information?
I suppose you'd use them as collateral on new loans, wouldn't you?
Kit!  Where've you been?
I'm sorry, Viv'.  Carlos has been on my back.  Did you get the money up front like I taught ya'?
Carlos.  I still owe him two hundred bucks...
Do I!?  Momma!
What?
But what if they serve soup?
Me?
Mr. Harris doesn't check out until tomorrow.
It's very expensive.
I think it's great.
So it's to be torture.
I swear it will be done.
I am no one to be trifled with, that is all you ever need know.
And what am I?
You mocked me once, never do it again -- I died that day!
Well ... you were dead.
I will never doubt again.
But how is that possible, since he's been marauding twenty years and you only left me five years ago?
Now, was that so terrible? ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           64.
It never happened.
It never happened. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          117.
Then you're not married -- if you didn't say it, you didn't do it  -- wouldn't you agree, Your Highness?
Well, I haven't fought just one person for so long. I've been specializing in groups. Battling gangs for local charities, that kind of thing.
Who's Guilder?
Well, I'm carrying three people. And he's got only himself.
Don't say that, Vizzini. Please.
It's you.
That leaves twenty for me. At my best, I could never defeat that many.  I need Vizzini to plan. I have no gift for strategy. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           82.
-- what? --
-- where?
The body?
I have a little.
Oh. Well, thank you very much. It's very nice of you. Your vote of confidence is overwhelming. All right.  The Princess Bride, by S. Morgenstern. Chapter One. Buttercup was raised on a small farm in the country of Florin.
What is it? What's the matter? ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           56.
Oh. You're sick, I'll humor you.  So now, where were we here? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Ah. Oh. Okay. Westley and Buttercup raced along the ravine floor.
I don't understand.
No, it's kissing again. You don't want to hear it.
My spy network has heard no such news.
Many of the thieves will resist. My regular enforcers will be inadequate.
It won't be easy, Sire.
The Thieves' Forest is emptied. Thirty men guard the castle gate.
I tell you once again -- surrender!
No.  To the pain.
I wasn't finished -- the next thing you lose will be your left eye, followed by your right --
Wrong! Your ears you keep, and I'll tell you why --
I'll beat you both apart. I'll take you both together.
And our assets?
There we cannot help you.
True, but that's hardly common knowledge, is it?  Thank you. Now, there may be problems once we're inside.
Not yet.
I thought he was with you.
I WANT MY FATHER BACK, YOU SON- OFA-BITCH!
Don't rush me, sonny. You rush a miracle man, you get rotten miracles. You got money?
Your first story was better.  Where's that bellows?  He probably owes you money, huh? Well, I'll ask him.
Look who knows so much. Well, it just so happens that your friend here is only mostly dead. There's a big difference between mostly dead and all dead. Please open his mouth.
Okay. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           97.
That does put a damper on our relationship.
That's very comforting. But I'm afraid you'll just have to wait.
You are ready, then?
You seem a decent fellow. I hate to die.
I don't swim. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           15.
There will be no arrangement --  -- and you're killing her!
I'm afraid so -- I can't compete with you physically. And you're no match for my brains.
I smell nothing.
Hmm.
What?
"Keep a shining in...
Do the books!  Do the books!
Koff, koff ... ahem, ahem ... harrumph ...
Sir, may I speak to you for a minute?
In looking at your books, I've discovered that ...
It's nothing ... nothing.
All right.  I'll do it.  I'll do it.
Exactly.  And how long did it run?
No, Bloom, you don't understand. This is fate, this is destiny. There's no avoiding it.
Don't touch me!  Don't touch me!
I'm hysterical.  I'm having hysterics.  I'm hysterical.  I can't stop.  When I get like this, I can't stop.  I'm hysterical.
I already have.  Come on.
Mrs. Virginia Resnick.  She also owns 50% of the profits.
They'll say, "Oooh, wah, wah, wah, ooh, ooh."
I'll show you.  Ulla, go to work.
Why?  Take it when you can get it! Flaunt it, baby, flaunt it!
I'm turning myself in.  It's the only way.  I'm going to cooperate with the authorities.  They'll reduce my sentence and then there's time off for good behavior.  And maybe I'll get a job in the prison library.  So long.
What???
Liebkind, no!
What is it?
Ahhhhhh.  Leo, Leo, Leo.
Mr. Liebkind, wait ...
Mr. Liebkind, relax, relax, we're not from the government.  We came here to talk to you about your play.
With whom?
Really, I never dreamed ...
Yes.  We would!
All right, but remember, if you damage the Fuhrer's reputation, I kill you.
Never mind.  Listen.  Every night people are laughing at your beloved Fuhrer.  Why?
No.  No Motel.  Get car.  Get car.
Very nice girl.
Good.  That's enough.  We'll do the rest on Thursday.  That's a good girl.  It's always such fun to see you.
Oooh.  I love it.  Hold me, touch me.
And we'll finish playing the Contessa and Rudolfo.
And after that we'll play the Abduction and cruel rape of Lucretia ... And I'll play Lucretia.
Wagner...
Bismark...
Hindenburg...
Heil you know who!
I mean in show business.
Heil, baby!  I just finished the morning propaganda broadcasts.
I'm looking for a missing person.  My name's Arbogast, private investigator...  Trying to trace a young girl who's been missing almost a week. From Phoenix.  It's a private matter... family wants to forgive her...  She isn't in trouble.
Committing myself to what? You sure talk like a Policeman.
She might have used an alias. Mary Crane's the real name, but she might've registered...
No one met her?
You didn't spend the whole night with her did you?
And when she left, she never came back.
Someone is sitting in that window.
Or if she had you say... gallantly protecting her... you wouldn't be fooled... you'd know she was just using you. Wouldn't you?
Just for a moment. She might have picked up a hint you'd miss.
Wouldn't have been able to tail you if you did.
Not even a hunch. Just hope.
It looks fine. How much will it be, with my car...?
I think I have the necessary papers. Is there a Ladies Room...
I'd really rather not. Please.  Can't we just settle this and...
You got aspirins? I have something... not aspirins, but  my mother's doctor gave these to me the day of my wedding.  Teddy was furious when he found out I'd taken tranquilizers!
Buzz me the minute she comes in.
Her sister's going to do that.  She's as worried as we are.
How'd you and this detective come to trace her to Fairvale?
And the police haven't been able to...
Like what?
I think something's wrong, too, Miss. But not the same thing. I think your private detective is what's wrong.  I think he got himself a hot lead as to where your sister was going... probably from Norman Bates...  and called you to keep you still while he took off after her and the money.
Norman Bates' mother has been dead and buried in Greenlawn Cemetery for the last ten years!
May I talk to you?
I hate tears. 
Not that kind...  You men and your egos.
No.
She'll need both of us.
Where's the old highway?
Sam! Why call when we can go?
Why can't I go out there with you?
This is Lila Crane, from Phoenix. She's been here for a few days, looking for her sister. There's a private detective helping... and, well, we got a call tonight, from this detective, saying he'd traced Mary...
We were going to get married. Are going to get married!
Watch your tenses.
I'm going with you. But we'd better decide what we're going to say and do when we walk in...
It didn't get washed down. It's figuring... the kind you tear up and get rid of.  Some figure has been added to or subtracted from... forty thousand.
When you're married you can do a lot of things deliberately.
Can you?
We can see each other, we can even have dinner... but respectably, in my house with my mother's picture on the mantel and my sister helping me broil a big steak for three!
Sam! No!
Sam, let's go get married.
Mother...  ...what is the phrase... "she isn't herself today"... I think that's it.
It's more than a hobby... sometimes... a hobby is supposed to pass the time, not fill it.
Where are you going? I don't mean to pry...
What are you running away from?
I was born in mine. I don't mind it anymore.
It's too late for me. And besides... who'd look after her? She'd be alone up there, the fire would go out... damp and cold, like a grave. When you love someone, you don't do that to them, even if you hate them. Oh, I don't hate her.  I hate... what she's become. I hate... the illness.
Yes, and just one time can be enough.  Thank you.
I'm very tired. And I'll have a long drive tomorrow. All the way back to Phoenix.
I'd like to, but...
Maybe you saw Mary!
You must remember that bad business out there. About ten years ago...
Arbogast.
It ain't only local history, Sam, it's the only murder-and-suicide case in Fairvale ledgers! Mrs. Bates poisoned this guy she was... involved with, when she found out he was married, then took a helping of the same stuff herself.  Strychnine. Ugly way to die.
Uh, uh! My boss is paying for this trip... ninety percent business... and he wants practically notarized receipts. I better sign in and get a receipt.
Yes, matter of fact.  The wife's taking a nap and... I can never keep quiet enough for her... so I thought I'd look you up and... talk.
Fine.
I didn't think so.
Leave me alone!
Go on, go tell her she'll not be appeasing her ugly appetite with my food... or my son! Or do I have to tell her, cause you don't have the guts? Huh, boy? You have the guts, boy?
This detective was out there and Norman told him about the girl and the detective thanked him and went away.
Did I?
I understand my husband is-- your assistant. May I see him please?
You say a fortune. He never spoke to me of any rich relatives.
Maybe you're right.
Oh, no. It's my own idea. I'm in the business. In the fur business.
Oh, Maxwell? He's left.
I'm losing my blood!
A voice ...
Yes.
But ... the dogs...
No?
Another fragment of the diary is shown [having to do with vampires].
It's Igor at the Wax Museum! You'll find your judge embalmed in wax! He's a statue of Voltaire, with all the other corpses! The whole place is a morgue -- do you hear? -- a morgue! 
I don't think you could have a real affair. You couldn't care for anyone.
No? Give me a chance, baby. Money is music in my ears, and when his old man kicks off there'll be a million dollar tune.
Delighted, I'm sure. 
I'd call it stupid at any time.
So that's the way it is?
I'd love to, at any time.
They are.  My boy, I think you are right. Everyone is tired out today and now that we have seen my doors open in a new country, I am beginning to realize that I am a little tired myself. You can call that fellow in from the front. I think we'll close for the night.
It is no trouble at all, my child. This is the strange, vicarious pleasure that remains for me -- to see others enjoy the beauty I used to create.  My footing is not too secure.
We have found immortality, you and I. You must not be afraid.
I'm not kidding. Joan Gale's body is packed in the box in the basement, and I saw the most horrible thing down there.
Yeah.  Have a pleasant vacation?
That you're a sure bet to place in the bread line. There's no room on this rag for the purely ornamental. You're easy on the eyes and pretty conceited about it.
That is none of our business.  But you bring me something for the next edition if it's only a recipe for spaghetti! 
Well, I won't work on it from that angle.
And they never proved anything against him.
Well, that's got nothing to do with this case. Can I handle this my way?
So you can give me an argument and tell me I'm wrong. Don't be sil, Kid.
Well, no one would ever suspect it. You don't sound right.
We'll grant that.
That dear, innocent Judge Ramsey that you were so sure got bumped off for knowing too much has been located in South America.
What do you mean -- haywire? You start out after murderers and come back with three-for-a-dime bootleggers. You start to solve murder mysteries and break up crap games. You're grand! I'm for you! Stupendous!
I'm going to get even with you, you dirty stiff! I'll do it!
Where were you going when you got in that cab?
Don't remember what day that was, do you?
Yes, she committed suicide yesterday. That's not news. I heard about it last year.
It's all yours.
Ain't that something. The mad monk of Manhattan. Here goes nothing.  Listen to the animal cracker roar like a lion.
My lawyers will be on the job in a little while, and I warn you people anything you print about me you've got to prove. Dad won't stand for--
They didn't give me a chance. We had a couple of drinks and she was all right then. She seemed happy.
She laughed and told me that we were being silly, that we didn't care for each other any more but we needn't hate each other ...  ... She said she wanted to be friends.
No, really -- I'm crazy about you.
You don't believe me. You think I'm just talking. Will you marry me?
Don't ask any questions. Come on!
Even those delicate veins, the texture of this flesh -- I have never seen anything more exquisite.
She will undoubtedly keep her promise. If you'll grant me the privilege, I'd like to submit this work to the Royal Academy when I get back.
Something important has got to come of it! Do you know that the rent on this place isn't paid?
No -- I'm lying to amuse myself!  Now look here, I've an idea that will get us out of all this. We haven't twopence between us, but we've got these. 
You're insane.
I wonder if I could have her pose for me.
They didn't have a leg to stand on. There's no case against me. It's a clumsy thing to have happen, but nothing to worry about.
Dad...
Yes....
That's the physicist's playground.
God.  I dunno.  The eternal nothingness. Mia.
Then you get it.  You'll understand.
So I can move on.  You too.
Where is she?
Sex isn't ugly, sex is one of the most beautiful things in life, the creative power of the universe is behind it.
This isn't punishment, I don't believe in punishment. It's for your health. Obviously you're sick if you can act like that.
Your Daddy is a wonderful man, I'll say that. He's the best and most kind-hearted man in the world.
What'd you do, Rose?
But, Rose, how could such a thing as that happen?
Buddy, quit that, you're just a child, you're not supposed to be interested in such things.
Buddy, you don't realize it but what you're doing isn't nice.
First I couldn't feel it, but now I feel it easily, it's like a little acorn.
That was very interesting. Thank you, Rose.
It was softer'n I thought, that was my main impression. You know, if you hit a girl there it would hurt her a lot.
I'm curious to see what it's like. I'm very curious, Rose.
Can't I touch it a little, Rose -- not a lot, just a little?
But Rose...
No. No, I'm all right.  Oh, God, what have I done? I have robbed a cradle and fallen into hell!  I must be crazy, a child like you. Oh, God, oh, Lord. This is awful, this is terrible, I gotta get outta here!
Oh, Buddy, you do love me! I knew you did, knew it all the time...
Rose, if you don't keep your boyfriends away from the house, Daddy is going to fire you.
They're dumb things. I got tired of them.
All right, what do you know?
Well, a little.
Yeah, he's still up there.
You mean confirmed, Mother. I didn't confirm it before. I would have had to confirm it previously, in order for it to be reconfirmed.
In the kitchen drinking all the ice water in Glenville. She walked out here, she didn't go by the hotel.
Okay.
Let me look.  Aww-rr...
Then why does she act so dumb?
Um-hmm, and I suppose that incensed you?
No, son, she is dead.
I am afraid so, son. About a week ago. Her husband phoned me, she had asked him to call me if anything happened.
She was fifty-six, son. Of course she didn't look it, nowhere near it. The cancer came back, I'm afraid I fibbed about that. But it was very quick, son. She was in the hospital only two weeks, and the last week she didn't know anything.
First, about the girl's history. Evidently she's been very promiscuous since early childhood, she has no control over her sexual impulses. Furthermore, she is permanently barren, she can't have children.
I have of course observed the girl in treating her.
I think we both know her.
Honey, she's perfect. She works all the time and she's wonderful with the children. And they love her, even Brother likes her though he won't admit it. I think she's just perfect.
And she's such a good-hearted thing, there isn't an ounce of harm or malice in her.
There are no flies on Rose, I don't know what you're talking about.
I'm not in the fourth dimension --  -- you are in the fourth dimension, when you allow skepticism and doubt to take control. As Blake said, if God had doubt the sun would go out.
She will succeed.
Yes, of course.
I will not sit here and listen to you be brutal to this poor girl.
You certainly are! She has an awful toothache, look at her jaw, it's all swollen.
Just a moment! You are not going to fire this girl for an innocent thing like having boy friends, not while there is breath in my body!
It isn't her fault if she's popular... what?
Well, that's very reasonable. Howe I hate to bring it up, but she's got an awful toothache, we've got to carry her to the dentist.
But morals come from the heart, not from rigid rules and empty laws. And in her heart Rose has never hurt anyone and she never would. Therefore, she's not immoral. Not really.
Honey, please...
Just a minute, Rose, you don't understand. This isn't a dirt farm like the one you were born on, it's nice. A neighbor of Cousin Hop's, I talked to him on the phone, a fine man... it's not a farm, damn it, it's a beautiful dairy establishment! Stop crying, Rose! Do you hear me? Stop crying, it's ideal!
I don't give a hoot in hell's hollow what it means to her! She can't stay in this house forever! I fired her, damn it!
Poor thing, don't cry, Rose. I know you feel awful, but don't cry, honey, nobody's perfect. Who's the father, dear?
Well, I know, more so. That's why I was thinking... maybe she'd be better off.
Fine.
I... I'll get the grits.
There are more on the other side.
Yes, sir. I had to go to the bathroom.
Oh, I'll just mosey around here and there.
Yes, Mr. Hillyer, it was. I... I heard strange voices in the night.
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
That's all you've got to say, you've got a bad cold?
I have to go back to the hotel. I'm on duty at the desk and who knows a quest might arrive. I will see you at suppertime, Rose.
I will see you at suppertime, Rose.
Well, Mr. Hillyer, Billy's very poor, he don't have no money and there wasn't no place else to go.
Well. What kinda job is it?
No, you're not.
Page proof of a book I'm working on.
Dave, you are as full of shit as a Christmas turkey and you know it. Now if you want to start a fight on this plane and get yourself in jail, go right ahead. But I am telling you, you are full of shit right up to your eyeballs.
Dave Schapiro is no horse doctor and Rose has been a good wife to him for a long time. To call her a nymphomaniac is the most stupid thing I ever heard in my life.
Yeah, I remember it.
Dave, I haven't seen Rose for years.
Daddy wouldn't hear that. Now the redhaired boy you see sitting there, of course you have met him, he is my oldest son and my most brilliant child. All children have great creative powers, but I don't want to rattle on about my children, they say I brag too much about them, especially about Brother. Am I boring you, Rose?
I don't know. I think he's cryin'!
She hid it from us, Doctor. She's afraid of the hospital.
But the wisdom tooth will have to be pulled?
You can stop it right now.
More history, Rose.
I like to work. I don't mind work. It's the least I can do after all you and Mr. Hillyer have done for me.  You're so sweet. There never was nobody like you.
No, ma'am, I'm just fine.
Mrs. Hillyer, I don't know who he is, I really don't.
Be quiet, Rose.
Rose, sit down in that chair and be quiet! We're trying to help you, you silly creature, sit in that chair!
I'm not hungry. I can't eat nothin', I haven't been able to eat since I got fired. I think maybe I'm sick.
I know it's embarrassing... but who were you exposed to, dear? ROSE Well, now, Mrs. Hillyer, I... ah-h, that's kinda hard to say.
You're not gonna see him again.
Put up your kickstand, freak.  Start talking, or we're out the door.
I figure, for this information, the usual payment... times ten.
Cuff'em.  Let's see what these two love birds say once they're sitting in separate cages.
Hey, listen... I'll give you something else, Kittle.  Anything. Remember... remember that corpse washed up on Huntington Beach?  It was never identified...
Read my lips: Zimmermann or nothing.
I'm telling you, you're barking up the wrong tree.
Again.
We catch 'em, I wanna be first to hurt 'em.  Promise me I get to go first.
Hands off the suit, monkey-boy. Close your eyes if you're scared.
Stop blaming yourself.
Welcome to Beverly Hills. Wife-swapping Capital of the World.
What?
Entertainers don't count.
You'll cry like a great big, blubbering baby.
We have to find Kittle.
If we don't catch a break soon, we're gonna be left standing with our dicks in our hands.
I'm waiting till the time's right.
Nope.
Where have you been?
You going rogue on me?
Just wanted to make you aware... before today's over, we'll be standing on top of your mountain of horse and pissing down on you.
I insist.  What will it be?  Boston Tea Party Clam Chowder, or maybe the Chicken Red, White and Cordon Bleu? No...  There's a special on the menu, today only...  ... <U>roasted</U> <U>pig</U>.
Wave that flag, hero.  Keep dreaming those dreams.
Whoops... don't mind me.  Go ahead and finish up.
Going into Zimmermann's pipeline.
First of all, the Constitution wasn't writtem till 1787...
You think this is so easy?
All for one...
Archibald Dobbs; Certified Public Accountant.  But, that's all we got.
Your wish is my command.
Seatbelts fastened, please.
So there's nobody around to get killed in the explosion.
Know what I love about dynamite?
Well, that's what I heard, and that's what I choose to believe.
You won't get another chance at this, Admiral.
You father was seduced by the dark side of the Force. He ceased to be Anakin Skywalker and became Darth Vader. When that happened, the good man who was your father was destroyed. So what I have told you was true... from a certain point of view.
Vader humbled you when first you met him, Luke... but that experience was part of your training. It taught you, among other things, the value of patience. Had you not been so impatient to defeat Vader then, you could have finished your training here with Yoda. You would have been prepared.
She hasn't been trained in the ways of the Jedi the way you have, Luke... but the Force is strong with her, as it is with all of your family. There is no avoiding the battle. You must face and destroy Vader!
Fine. Together again, huh?
All set.
Come on, Artoo.  We'll need your scanners.
Han, don't. It'll be all right.
That's all any of us can see.
All right. I understand. Fine. When he comes back, I won't get in the way.
No, wait! I thought you were blind!
Figured if I left you frozen like that you'd just give me bad luck the rest of my life, so I might as well get you unfrozen sooner or later.
Come on! Come on!
The Emperor does not share your optimistic appraisal of the situation.
Now...come on, Han, old buddy. Don't let me down.
Quiet.
Just a little bit. She died when I was very young.
But, why must you confront him?
Strong am I with the Force... but not that strong! Twilight is upon me and soon night must fall. That is the way of things... the way of the Force.
Your father he is.
I am See-Threepio, human-cy...
Oh. Well, yes.
I'm afraid so, Brad.  But wasn't it nice?
I know, but it wasn't all bad was it? I think you found it quite pleasurable.  Oh so soft.  So sensual.
Rocky!
Janet.
Dammit, Janet.
Oh dear!  But then where did the motorcyclists come from?
Just a moment, Janet.  They may have a telephone.
It's just a..a party Janet.
We can't go anywhere until I get to a phone.
Let's wait awhile Janet.  We don't want to interfere with their celebrations.
I'm here, there's nothing to worry about.
So baby don't cry like there's no tomorrow After the night there's a brand new day. And there'll be no pain And no more sorrow. So wash your face And phone my place It'll be O.K.
Yes.
Dr Scott I'm sorry about your nephew.
Nothing.  Why, do you think I should?
Like this - like how?  It's your fault. You're to blame.  I was saving myself.
From Transexual Transylvania.
Sha la la la That ain't no crime.
You're too kind.
Oh.
...I'm sorry.
...I don't know.
By accident?
It doesn't bother me either.
I don't think you're a bum.
'Cause you can't sing or dance?
...No thanks.
I sold them to you.
Yes, I do.
...I've never been in a man's apartment before.
They either say, 'Kill the nigger' or 'Hope you die, Honky.' -- What ya got in the bag?
-- The legs.
Ya right --  Mebbe we best just hold hands -- the shirt made me feel guilty, y'know.
Yeah... Threw my whole day off.
Apollo?
Oh, Rocky -- you worked so hard.
Christ.
That so.
It's not your house --
I want 'im outta here --  Don't think I'm good enough to work for Gazzo?  That's what I think of bums like you an' Gazzo!  You're goin' up an' don't care enough to throw Paulie some crumbs!  I give ya meat, an' I give ya my sister, too!
Get away from me -- I could never even get married 'cause you couldn't live by yaself -- ya'd die by yaself! So instead I put you two together -- Did ya think of puttin' in a good word for me? -- You owe me!
You're hurtin', man!
...Stop jivin'!
Very high an' very fast.
Any quick advice for young boxing hopefuls?
Of wa?
Wait here, gotta smooth this guy out.
...Yeah, give 'er the Blades.
It ain't your fault -- I originally done it in the Baby Crenshaw fight.  That's me fightin' Big Baby Crenshaw -- Big Baby was the size of an airplane an' I broke my hands on his head -- I lost, but it's a nice picture, don't ya think?
Charge it.
Am I seeing right? Creed is approaching the ring in a boat. Is he supposed to be George Washington? Obviously so.
Not only has he refused to fall, but he has beaten the Champion's body without mercy and the bout has become a vicious slugfest.
Not yellow, cautious.  See, it's very easy for a fighter to accidentally hurt --
Mr. Gazzo wants the two hundred now!
That's it.
You have my food in ya hand.
I figure if I break the thumb this guy gets thrown outta his job and can't pay nothin' no more.
Hey -- if a good man can make a better life, let him make it.
Black market?
No -- Just me.
Stuff it, man!
Maybe I like garbage.
C'mon, Rocky. I'm twelve.
Ya hope I don't keep acting like a whore or I'll turn into one, right?
'Night, Marie.
...Tomato?
...No.
Probably lookin' for sparrin' partners.
Yeah.
I done it all. I've done an' seen everything'. Believe what I'm tellin' ya -- Ya shoulda seen the night in Brooklyn, I smacked 'Ginny' Russo outta the ring, September 14, 1923 -- same night Firpo knocked Dempsey outta the ring. But who got the Press? He did. He had a manager -- September 14, 1923.
Ya got heart.
Thanks, Mick -- I'm gonna try.
Fine... That guy's great.
Would you keep goin'?
It ain't your locker no more.
'Bout what?
What?
...Adrian ain't sharp.
I don't see no crowd around you, neither.
Gazzo's gotta come to you -- Hey, Paulie, it's a bad job -- Do what you do now.
Maybe ya better forget it.
...No.
Sure I like her.
What can I do about it?
You mean the rabbit?  They got him cold.
I'm not worried about you.  I'm worried about the safe.
Oh, yeah?  Well, you're not handcuffed to him.  Anybody in the back room?
Maybe Baby Herman was right.  Somebody wants Acme's property.  Cack the old man, pin it on Roger, and destroy the will.
Then why'd they bother to crack the safe?  You can drop a Mosler 90 from Mount Baldy and it won't open.
<u>That</u> was the rabbit's wife.
Sounds like singin'.
Ask her...
It wasn't Toontown they wanted.  It was my idea of how to put the land to better use.
No...
Not much.  It's hard to talk.
Oh, please don't make fun of me, Mr, Valiant.  You don't know how hard it is being a woman looking the way I do.
That's not Roger.  It's one of Doom's men.  He killed R.K. Maroon.
We're even.  By the way, I did find your husband.
Marvin told me.  Doom was after his land.  Ne was afraid.  That's why he brought me his will.
That's what you woke me up for?
Just haven't been this close to Toontown for awhile.
Only there's no business like it, no business I know.
Sure, Valiant, sure...
No, I don't.
Yeah, that's better.
My philosophy is if you don't have a sense of humor, you're better off dead.
Why, you crazy Toon... I've been out there riskin' my neck for you.   I come back here and you're singin' and dancin'.
But, Eddie, you know what happens when...
If I'm so smart, how come I'm runnin' from the law with a Toon?
My brother.  Get inside.
We can't do anything till it's dark.
A Toon?  Noooo.
How much is a shave and a haircut, Roger?
Yeah?
Yeah?
Good idea.
And I'm glad you got your sense of humor back.  Think you'll keep it?
If you do, sir, I am for you.  I serve as good a man as you.
Leave Me!
Then I'll leave thee.
Nay, he will answer the letter's master, how he dares, being dared.
The what?
It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?
No, cuz, I rather weep.
At thy good heart's oppression.
Soft! I will go along; An if you leave me so, you do me wrong.
I fear, too early: for my mind misgives Some consequence yet hanging in the stars Shall bitterly begin his fearful date With this night's revels and expire the term Of a despised life closed within my breast By some vile forfeit of untimely death. But He, that hath the steerage of my course, Direct my sail! On, lusty gentlemen.
He shall be endured
If in thy wisdom thou canst give no help Do thou but call my resolution wise, And with this I'll help it presently!
Benedicite! What early tounge so sweet saludeth me?
The last is true; the sweeter rest was mine.
O, let us hence; I stand on sudden haste.
Affliction is enamoured of thy parts, and thou art wedded to calamity. Hence from Verona art thou banished. Be patient, for the world is broad and wide.
Welcome.
Talk not to me, for Ill not speak a word. Do as thou wilt for I have done with thee.
Then move not, while my prayer's effect I take. Thus from my lips, by yours, my sin is purged.
Neither, fair maid, if either thee dislike.
Lady, by yonder blessed moon I swear That tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops--
Well what shall I swear by?
The exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine.
Let me be taken, let me be put to death. I have more care to stay then will to go. Come death, Welcome, Juliet wills it so. How is't my soul? Let us talk it is not day.
Thou wast the prettiest babe that e'er I nursed.
Go, girl, seek happy nights to happy days.
I dream'd a dream to-night.
Well, what was yours?
In bed asleep, while they do dream things true.
Nay, I am the very pink of courtesy.
Farewell, ancient lady; farewell,
I thought all for the best.
I am for you.
Sir. Ah, sir. Death the end of all
Leaving...
Finding this package is a thing easier said than done.  We don't even know what it is.  What did we steal?
When this whole thing started you made it clear: you're running the show.  And I don't believe you'd be running this show if you didn't know what was going on.
So where do you go from here?
I'm up for that...
The deal?  The deal is we leave for Nice at first light.
Which leads us to...
Budweiser?  You talk to me of beer and you've the unbridled gall to mention Budweiser in the same sentence?  That's not beer!  Christ, it's not even a poor excuse for rabbit piss.
It means I was worried that all the time you spent away from the fold might have affected you.  You've been living the life of the hired gun -- the well paid hired gun, I might note.  There's no glory to it, but there are those that like it.
That's him.
You lose them!
Shut up!!!  Shut up and drive!  I'm your superior officer and you will do as I goddamn well say, is that understood?!?
Duty calls?
Exactly.  Gregor, he was the Russian's man.  It was my people came up with the idea for this run, but the Russians who had the capital to finance it.  Gregor, he was their insurance, and I was ours. Everybody else was supposed to be neutral.  Gregor must've got to Swede...
Oh please..you're on some sort of holy mission?
Alright?  It's bloody fucking freezing in here!
Come off it, Sam -- if we weren't friends already we wouldn't be here now, would we?
Good, because it cost enough.  There's cheaper phones by far than that one, man: you better fucking use it.
Don't do it, Sam!
He's a cop, Vincent, he's French and he's a cop and you better shoot him in the fucking head right now!
There's been a slight problem.
You'll die if you leave here.
I swear, it has to come here!  It has to...
It is, I'm telling you it is!!
But you hate each other!
I got this gig through a contractor. And he most definitely didn't know who was doing the hiring, only that they were paying a lot of money...
Now that is an interesting proposition.
I just wanted to make sure you knew who you were dealing with.
Hello, my friend.  He doesn't look French to me, Vincent.
Of course.  Don't you?
But first you have something to take care of?
Perhaps forged is a better word.  Like steel.  Like a sword.  You're a modern Samurai.  I've spent my life around extraordinary men -- men like Vincent. But I've never seen anyone like you.  I'm afraid Vincent will die if he goes with you.
Not for long.
Eat shit and die slowly...
I blast the lead car into oblivion...
That's what I thought.
I do.
I needed to see if you were a cop.  I'm a popular man with the police, Sam, and whenever they try to catch me they always do it with an inside guy -- some man on some job who seems more trustworthy than all the others put together.  And that's the guy you have to watch out for.  I hate cops...
I saw you look off when Francois nodded his head.  I figured he wasn't pointing out a particularly rare shrub, and the rest was easy.
I haven't.  Not like that.  How do you get used to it?
No hospitals.  I'll fix this myself if I have to.
If Tony says this is it, then it's it.
Dark ops?
Not very zen of you, huh?  Not so much the modern Samurai after all.
I would have tried not to.  But yes, if it would have kept him from shooting you, I would have.
Why are you driving?  You're not French, you don't live here, you don't know these roads.  Why are you driving?
I think not.
Yeah.  We need out fucking heads examined.
Closest and oldest.
Do you have a good answer?
You don't owe me a goddamned thing, Vincent, and you know it.  You stepped in front of a bullet for me.  I owe you a heavy debt.
Gone.  Destroyed.
Gonna be tough.
Seamus Reilly.
You should have kill him when you had the chance.  But no...
A friend.  I was telling him about how you always have the latest tapes.
You said you might know where we can get a copy of this tape?
The Russian would be easier.
I get the picture.
I gotta try and overcharge him, he has to moan about the price, we settle somewhere in the middle.
Hey Dwayne why don't you introduce him to your funeral parlor cousin?
I want to get some hounds down here.
Dwayne listen to me -
I hear you.
Cash and what?
I probably would have.  I guess the clues damn near before everyone.
What do you mean what are we going to do?
Robbed a bank, c'mon!  Don't you think we would have heard if one, two --  shit I don't know how many were at large!  Don't you think there would be a bulletin?  This is a big ass drug deal!
Why?
He saw everything!
He'll tell them everything to save his ass. That's how they all work it!
What are you thinking?
That's not what I mean.
Oh, right, with a little help from his pals Booth and Earl.  I'm sure that's gonna fly real far when they hear that tape...
He'll tell them everything to save his ass. That's how they all work it!
What are you thinking?
All we have to do is get our hands on the original tape.  We'll set him up somehow.
Yeah, I mean you're coming unglued, Jesse.
No.
I don't think he's going to be doing any bargaining with us, the stupid son-of-a-bitch!  Besides, I'm not giving him a third of anything, not after everything we had to do.
I don't know!  Shit, give me a break!
There it is...now what about the others?
He killed her...
It's NOT too late!
What's your offer, Jesse?
All right, Jesse, we'll play it your way, under one condition.
We're going to wait.  All of us, until everything dies down.
Hello.
Maybe.  That's where it was during Denning's last report.
It's odd.  I don't know how Denning had the time, or the ability to buy something local, based on his situation.
Yeah but I need to take out four hundred dollars and the ATM will only give me three.
He's irresponsible.
Oh.  You coming by tonight?
Booth.  Don't.  It's nothing. It's not worth it.  Remember what happened the last time?
He doesn't slobber, he just snores. And I told you we haven't...done anything in over a year.
It'd have to be Switzerland to make sure Dwayne never finds us.
A week ago, at most.
Yeah.
First you question my integrity, then you call me stupid...  ...that hurts, son.
We had hounds down at the scene, the footprint trail was a bust. And there were no other tire tracks in the vicinity.
This just might be our ticket!
That's news to me.  So it's over at Jesse's office?
Excellent. I'll go down with you.
Don't you think I would have told you that!
Hell no. besides I'm just a radio call away if something happens. I feel I should keep abreast of what happens, seeing it's my jurisdiction and all.
Is this marked money, or what?
So there was money there!  Who the hell's money is it?!
What the hell is that, some kind of porno store or something?
We are having a sale on some items over here --
Hmmm...
No I don't.  You sure you havent seen her?
Oh yeah.  Between here and Vegas we get a lot of customers.  All types.  Even had an officer, just like you.
He probably figured she was on her way out anyhow, no drugs in her system, no foul play.
Dammit youre persistent.  I dont want to listen to this anymore.  No more bets with you.
Yeah whaddya want?.
Well, we got the DEA coming down here again, I don't know, sounds to me like they got some more questions they want to ask us.
Well I'm here now.
No.  Something wrong with you Dwayne?
I was in the neighborhood.
Well, same ol' same ol'.
Nope. If you're a criminal you don't carry ID, and if you do you're a damn fool.
At least around here it does.
That doesn't tell us much. Did you run a check on the gas like I told you?
So...what's the good news?
What do you think?  Heart attack?
How much is that?
I'm up a hundred and fifty-grand. That's a Ferrari.  Do they sell those here in the gift shop?  Somebody cash me out!
I know Teddy Wu is cranking out a pretty good double sawbuck -- but you knew that too, didn't you?
How do we know you're not lying?  Let me see your badge.
In 1959, the United States was very friendly with the Shah of Iran.  We wanted his oil, so for the Shah's birthday, the government gave him a gift -- a U.S. Treasury Intaglio press.  The only one to ever leave the country. Five years ago Ricky Tan bought that press on the black market.
I said get on your feet!
Lee, you okay?
Never leave home without it.  Lee, this one's on me.  You save your money.
No.  It's my first time.
I knew you were lying.
Damn it, why are you ruining my night? I'm just starting to have fun.  Well fine then, go ahead, pull your badge and do your thing.
You mean Tito.  We had  Toto for dinner last night.
Carter...you ready to have some fun!?
She said I could pick any girl I want.
Who?
Don't be talking about my mama.  Or my ass!
IT IS CRAZY!
Not bad.  Now every crime, somewhere, has a rich white man taking his cut. Every single one.  Now in our case, we know the rich white man is Steven Reign.
Yeah, what about when Godzilla was coming?  You people were screaming your asses off.
How do you know?
You pull a muscle or something?
We are not partners.  Between your daddy, my daddy, and the beating I just took, as far as I can tell all partners get you is dead.
I don't believe in reincarnation.  So I won't see you in the next world.
I believe in heaven.  You people believe in heaven?
There was no sex.  She was very traditional.  We were waiting until we were married.
Once in a while, steamed dumplings.  But only when she was drunk.
That was the name of Ricky Tan's boat.
Wait here.  I'll handle this.
Yes.
I guess so.  Thank you, Carter.
It's okay, I got lots more.
Some Kung-Pao?
Hey, you, Secret Service Man, what are you --
Why don't you go get them?
How do I know I can trust you?
No.  But I'll help you.
I'm fine.
It's my responsibility.
The bomb was meant as a demonstration of our sincerity.  If you want the Ambassador's daughter back alive, listen and do not talk.
In used currency.  Nothing bigger than a fifty.
So was I.
I didn't say I didn't.  You assumed I didn't.
What?
Witnesses.
Mr. Carter, I appreciate your desire to show me a good time, but that is not the reason I am here.
You don't know what a shortcut is?
Don't go there...
Hey, everybody fits in here. Look at L.A., man.  Nobody's from here.  My momma's from Detroit, my dad's from Atlanta, they met in Texas, got married in Vegas and I was born in Alabama.  So where the hell am I from? Kenya?
That is a problem. There is no description of Juntao. No known photograph.
Juntao's standing orders were to kill everyone. There were never witnesses.
Yes, I think so.
Yee-aww.
Good God, ya'll!
I got to stop that dancing in the street till all hours.
Nobody in America eats fish in the AM. We're talking strictly an after twelve noon food type.
Going into the restaurant.
This concrete?  This is still America.
Oh yes.
What?
Hey, don't worry.  Nothing's gonna happen to it.
FBI calls up my ass, says they need help in Tokyo.  Like I'm supposed to drop everything.
They put you in charge?
OK. Well...make us proud.  And be careful.
No way in the way!  I'm talkin' back up, Johnson. I'm in charge! And I need you, baby.
Yes I do. That's all I got. Guts and you, Johnson. There's no one else I can trust.
That's it! You can attack me, but when you attack my car, I cannot forgive! You in the back, girl!
It's okay. For restaurants.
Don't worry about the kidnapping, Carter, the F.B.I. will handle that. Your assignment is Lee.
Bottom line: I don't want some Chung King Cop getting his head blown off and turning this operation into a international incident.
Don't play bullshit games with me.
Do it!
How did I do this?! Maybe you didn't notice but I'm in jail!
I'm waitin' here for a name.
I understand, sir. But you are an honored guest of the United States...
Carter, can I have a moment?
I was trying to find the right time.
Soon Young, don't worry.  You will have many friends very soon.  You will see.  America is a very friendly place.
Eight is good... "V" could be Victory.
I'm sorry, Ike.  This is permanent.
Since when does Ellie need moral supp--
What are you trying to say to me, Fish?
Then come for dinner.
Order out like a Philistine, when you got the Galloping Gourmet here?...
Good fact.  Well, you let me know.
Not yet.  I had a phlemless morning.  I hear he's a pretty good ballplayer.
-- The luau for Maggie.
Oh, yeah.  Scared the hell out of Skipper.
Gotta tell you this about my daughter. My daughter makes real good time, even in a long dress and heels.  Maggie may not be Hale's longest running joke, but she certainly is the fastest.
Originality is my speciality.
Yes.
Despite what you think, I don't do it on purpose.  And I have no intention of doing it again.
We think so.
Seven-fifty.
You don't know.
Maybe you should ask her some time. Ever thought of that?
Of course.
It was in the attic.  It was jus sitting there gathering dust.
Of what?
Or maybe you just wanted to wear the headdress.
With the priest, you liked them scrambled.  With the Dead Head, fried. With the bug guy, poached.  Now it's egg whites only, thank you very much.
I kissed him back.
I don't know.  I, uh -- I frankly don't even want to talk about it.
Me?
Well, you do have the dress.
I wanted to talk to you about why I run or ride away from things.
I didn't.  And you being the one at the end of the aisle didn't just fix that.
I was, because if you said "yes" right away, I wouldn't get to say this next part.  And I've been practicing it.  Ready?
"I guarantee that we'll have tough times.  I guarantee  that at some point one or both oof us will want to get out. But I also guarantee that if I don't ask you to be mine, I'll regret it for the rest of my life. Because I know in my heart -- you're the only one for me".
I borrowed it from this guy I know. So?
Yes, I've seen it.  And I have to say it's the rudest and most offensive... joke anybody's ever played on me!
She's the boss.
Where?
Why?
No, I don't think you're like, "I'm charming and mysterious in a way that even I don't understand and something about me is crying out for protection from a big man like you".  Very hard to compete with.  Especially to us married women who have lost our mystery.
It's only funny at Camp Birchwood at three in the morning at a tick hunt. It's not anymore.
Thanks.  Will you fix my hair?
See, this is a mature relationship. She's really found it.
Not eight...
No, I'm just going to head home.
Good boy, Port Hole.
Thank you, Dad.
"And her ritual feast continues as she prepares to make a sacrifice out of the seventh fiance.  So all bets are on and we hope that this boomerang bride isn't honeymooning with Las Vegas odds makers because many predict that this girl is out of there before the race... before the rice hits the ground"  Holy moly.
No.
Yeah.
What am I going to do with a microwave?
Houseboats don't go anywhere.
It's on the lake right in the middle of Seattle.  It rains nine months of the year in Seattle.
My head swells up like a watermelon and I drop dead.
Nope.
Don't be silly.  I'll just be ten minutes behind you.
Not for the kind of place I want to do.  I won't be in Chicago that long.
About what?
Nothing's with me.
I know that.  You think I don't know that? "I know that's a dumb way to begin, but it's the only way I can think of to convey what happened to me the other night when I heard the two of you on the radio.  On the other hand, maybe I'm just losing my mind."
I should say something in this about magic.
I know.
That's not what I mean.  I'm going back over there tomorrow and talk to him.  I am.
You know that dream where you're walking down the street naked and everyone is looking at you?
That was nothing compared to this humiliation, nothing.
He said hello.
It's a sign I've watched this movie too many times.  I'm so stupid.  From the minute I listen to that stupid program on the radio, I've been a complete jerk.
No, I'm not. 
So you want a financial, is he a deadbeat, we can do a D&B --
Hi, Jonah.  Sam.  And who is this?
What?
Walter and I are engaged!
Granny's dress.  Oh, Mom.
What?
Mom!
Hello.
Thanks, but I'll pass.  It's kind of a big night.  I don't like to leave Jonah alone.
I'm not selling anything.  Your son called and asked for advice on how to find you a new wife.
Dr. Marcia Fieldstone of Network America.
I think it's hard for him to talk to you about all this. Maybe we could talk and it would make him feel a little better.
It's not for me.  It's for my dad.  I think he needs a new wife.
He doesn't have one now. That's the problem.
Okay, but if I get yelled at, I'm never gonna listen to this show again.
How about rapacious and love- starved?
This is going to be tougher than I thought.
I have forty-two.  So that would definitely cover taxicabs, I think.
Stressed.
-- a slice of pizza --
What do you think?
It's nice to meet you, Jessica.
I know.
What was?
Is that what she used to sing?
Jonah, I'm leaving --
She doesn't want us to go to Baltimore.  She wants to meet us in New York City on Valentine's Day.  On top of the Empire State Building.
Okay.
Thanks for dinner.  I never saw anybody cook potatoes that way.
I thought I saw a black widow spider.
It might be in the kitchen.
Hi.  He should book now because we can get an excursion fare. Jessica's parents are travel agents and --
You must be Jonah.
So whatdya say? I'll get the check, and I'll call you in eight months.
I know her pretty well.  Maybe I could call her --
He's good at it.
Naturally. You think I parked here for a cup of coffee?
That's none of their affair.
No. My name is Quintero. Mister Quintero.
There's nothing stopping you.
Whose side are you on anyway?
You want 'em all arrested?
I say we gotta take action. Now.
It's the paymaster from Moscow -- with our gold.
The woman question?
So? What does he want to do about 'em?
What do you mean -- sex equality?
So much the better.
An American.
Sure. Where they're negotiating. In the company office. We'll go up there and picket the place.
No. No. I can't. If Ramn ever found me on a picket line ...
Good. Come in, we'll work it out. Sit down, sit down.
With Ramn it's ... pride. I spoke out of the bitterness in me. And he was hurt.
What?
I did forget. Lus told me.
I'd lie on my cot in the cell and I couldn't sleep with the bugs and the stink and the heat. And I'd say to myself, think of something nice. Something beautiful. And then I'd think of you. And my heart would pound against the cot for love of you.
What makes you so sure?
No.
All right, but later. I've got a meeting now.
Yes. To plan for the picket line tomorrow.
Sun up.
Why not? I'm not needed here.
Aah! They've got other mines. You don't see the larger picture.  They've got millions. Millions. They can outlast us, and they know it.
Like what?
Charley Vidal says!  Don't throw Charley Vidal up to me!
Shut up, you're talking crazy.
Me, I'm a camp follower -- following this organizer from one mining camp to another -- Montana, Colorado, Idaho. But did he ever think to organize the women? No. Wives don't count in the Anglo locals either.
Exactly. And equality's the one thing the bosses can't afford. The biggest club they have over the Anglo locals is, "Well -- at least you get more than the Mexicans."
You mean Delaware?
New York? You're not the Company President by any chance?
It's Mama's Saint's Day.
You think I was going to work you over? I wouldn't dirty my hands with you ...
Nothing, I'm trying to remember...
Now that's down-right insulting.
Colette ...
Don't tell me, down deep he's really not a bad person and you don't want to see him get hurt.
Then why don't you leave?  Just give me one good reason.
How?
Never heard of him.
You really need to lighten up.
Yes. Why do you find that so hard to believe?
You don't like the tune, find another station.
No. But I'm the only one with my sad story.  And that's how it's gonna stay.
It's me.
What about a battered woman's shelter? You can move you kid in with you.
Find a new job.
You always been this stubborn?
Ass first into the world.
Look, maybe you oughta' leave.
I don't want to leave you.
What?
I found forgiveness in my heart for the people who killed my daughter. I gave my grief to Jesus Christ.
Your hatred makes them stronger and you weaker.
I know a guy.
Well, Jimmy the Finn, let's go score some gack.
Oh ... that.  Ah, he was just juiced. He wouldn't have did nothin'
Can your man handle that?
10%.  That's ...
The Del Ammo Mall mostly.
You're my best friend, man. I'd do anything for you.
I'm not a tweaker.  I don't use drugs. I never had.
Are you kidding me? A bunch of amped -out tweakers? It was easy.
Because I don't want to see you end up like Kujo and those other losers.  I thought that maybe if you knew that I didn't use, you might see it in yourself to go clear.
Um, I think the Warren Commission has been closed for a while.
I deal in U.S. pounds, friend. None of that faggot metric crap for me.
Big Bill
Okay! Okay!
Don't do that. Please.  Or I'll kill you.  Please, Danny.
You go, boy.
Don't be. I'm worried about the kid.
I can't help it, Tanner, you hit like a fucking girl.
We got the 411 on your good old boy.
Jesus.
It speaks!
What's he holding?
Yeah.  What about him?
What?!
Who the hell is Jimmy?
And he probably only told two people and they probably only told four people and on and one. You know better than to tell a secret to a tweaker, Flynne.  Might just as well broadcast it on the evening news.
Oh they're all that and the proverbial bag of chips.
They have. But they never found a lab.
Thank you.  Thank you very much.
Again, I thank you.
It's that disgusting hot dog you had for lunch.
Fourty-four, twenty one dead.
Where are your men now?
There's a Private James Ryan who parachuted in with the Hundred-and- First near Ramelle.  I want you to take a squad up there.  If he's alive, bring him back to the beach for debarkation.  Take whoever you need, you've got your pick of the company.
Figured.
No kidding.
What about the Captain?  Where's he from?
Forty-two-hundred, I figure.
Wade, Sarge, Corporal Insect, all of us, hell, I'll bet even the Captain has a mother.
Reiben, are you makin' fun 'a the way I talk?
I think I'm we got that eighty-eight.
Nope, he ain't Wade.
What deal?
Jackson, how many times I got to tell you, you're from Tennessee.
Sir, I ain't feeling so chipper on account of Wade.
Good, now get your goddamned gear.
To each, his own.
White-walls?
Senator's son?
On the other side of the street, crouches in a doorway with Jackson. Upham is a bit in shock, less from the nearness of the bullets than from what Miller just did for him.
Yes.  Do you know Sibelius' Fourth Symphony, The Normandy?
A machine gun.
Those are Tigers, they have six-inch armor, they don't even notice grenades.
Sure, you got one?
Rolls his eyes, takes a breath. Scrambles into the gap.  The other five right behind.
Okay, Wade.  Translators?
What about Talbot?
Since when have things been normal?
They're fine.  As long as they can gripe, they'll be alright.
Nope.
Three for three.
Let's just find someplace.
Yeah.
It could be worse.  You know the first thing they teach you at O.C.S.? Lie to your men.
I know.
Sure, meet me at the top, we'll start the paperwork.
Don't worry, we're the only Rangers this side of the continent, we've got to be first into Caen.
Please, sir, you can't take me to Ramelle, I gotta go to Caen, sir, please, I told you, they make Caen lingerie there, it's beautiful, it's the best there is, it's...oh, please, sir...
No, I'm not, Kaback is, honest.  Or what about Faulkner?  Or that little guy with the glasses?
But, sir...
Well, I, for one, like cheese.
Stands on the edge of the woods, almost in a trance.
Reiben, there's a fairly good chance you're not going to die at all.
Has anyone ever told you, you're officer material?
Here they come.
Struggling with a pair of Germans.
And Sarge?
What about you, Captain?
Since I was nine years old.  They got a lot of explosives around mines. Me and my little brother could get into any warehouse you ever saw. Damn, we had fun!
It's easy, it runs in my family, take my grandfather, for example...
Who knows?  It worked.
Twenty-four-five.
We believe that your father operates in a large pool of cash that comes from phoney billings, phoney patients.  We've been investigating him for five years.  We believe that when they die, he takes their money.
Don't let your father's business infect your life.
Taking care of people isn't a growth enterprise, Mr Sims.  I hope you write that down in your report, I'd like your bosses to read it.
Good for her.
Oh yeah, let me give you another card.
I hope you understand.
He's a mess!
Forget it, forget it, it's mine, it's mine!
See you tomorrow.
Lloyd, send her flowers, write her a letter.  Something.
If she wants me, she can come to me.
I dream about it.
One hundred thousand dollar fine and three months?
I'm going to take out Diane Court again.
'Cause I'm a guy, I have pride.
Okay.
Well, it's almost over.  We've gone to school together for three years, and we've been through a lot.  But with that training out of High School gone, what's going to happen to us?  We all know what the answers are.  We want to be happy, go to college, own a car, maybe raise a family.  But what if that doesn't happen?  I have, I have to be honest though, I have all the hope and ambition in the world.  But when I think about the future, the truth is, I am really...scared.
You're going to take a big step, a big leap, and before you do, I just want one thing from you, miss.  You stand up straight and admit you're special.
We'll worry about that later.  Now come on, tell me that you're special.
Dad.
And then you got up and you told them to turn the plane around.
Dad, I'm sorry.
I was irresponsible, I should have called.
Diane, you owe it to yourself to get on that plane with no attachments, no strings, because after you get over there, things are going to change.  People change.
Well then don't pick it up. You know what's best.
Just finishing up in here.
You know, I don't even know if you've got a young man in your life?
Look at those eyes.
Thank you very much.
Oh, thanks, but I'm busy.
Y'know, you're not in England yet, you know that of course, and by the way, I want to just tell you that I lived in England for a few months,
Eight.
Would you hold this for me?
No.
Yeah.
Mine say stuff like "Lloyd, see you around maybe"
Well, my parents split up when I was thirteen, and... god, I actually had to... I went into court and I had to choose between the two of them.  So I chose my dad.  It just felt safer that way, you know?
Twisted?
Job?  Being a great date.
Sixteen weeks is a long time.
Yeah?
I had a checklist in mind.  I thought that if babies were on the plane, the plane couldn't crash.  But all the babies were crying, and I thought they knew something I didn't.
Come on.
Really?  Um... I... well... you're really turning me around here,
Your letter came yesterday.
Uh-huh.  It was wonderful.
I know.  Lloyd, let's not start putting things on this level.
You need to study?
No, no.
Lloyd, we shared the most intimate thing two people can share.
No I didn't.
No.
I'm sorry.
I love you.  Please, I love you.
Man, you never had a chance with a girl like that.
Hook up the jab, hook up the jab.
Uh... okay... um...
No.
Hello Lloyd.
Are you going to England with her Lloyd?
She's very successful.
I know this part, keep reading.
It does, it does if it's the version signed 'I still can't help loving you'.  Read that.
Thanks a lot Lloyd.
Yeah, alright.
I got a question.  If you guys know so much about women, how come you're here at like the Gas 'n' sip on a Saturday night completely alone, drinking beers, no women anywhere?
Klaus Tauber.
My plant manager is somewhere on this train. If it leaves with him on it, it'll disrupt production and the Armaments Board will want to know why.
I feel like an old-fashioned couple. It feels good.
Good.
You're kidding.
They're taking mine.  When I said they didn't have a future I didn't mean tomorrow.  Auschwitz.
Look it up.
Takes diamonds to stay on this list.
There's nothing in the stores.
Nice things cost money.
I don't know, ten or twelve.  That's a good color.  Dark blues, grays.
She's good.
The contracts?  That's the easy part. Finding the money to buy the company, that's hard.
The Jewish worker's salary, you pay it directly to the SS, not to the worker. He gets nothing.
And killing.
I think it's too late.
No?
No, no, what, what is it?
You did so much.
37 usages of Himbry  located in the registar's office. 9 Tatum's, 47 Riley's. And that's just on campus. It's hopeless.
On national television.
I won't.
I'm losing you.
Why aren't you there?
What if I said you?
Did it?
Please, Cotton, dont do this.
Its over, Cotton.
What are you doing here? I thought you had retired from field reporting?
Why don't you ask them?
Youre all in this together?
Don't ask what you can do. No coddling. Life rolls on status quo.
I'll get my jacket.
Let us decide that.
No. This is a set up.
What guy?
I got it..
I find his work overwrought.
I read her postings on the horror movie chat boards and fell hopelessly. Hook, line...
Hope youre ready, Sid. We got one last surprise for you.
And we didnt want to do that, Sid. We wanted to give you your moneys worth.
And an explanation is, of course, out of the question.
How do you know my dim-witted inexperience isn't merely a subtle form of manipulation used to lower people's expectations thereby enhancing my ability to effectively maneuver within any given situation?
Dewey, you and I would never make it.
..and as lonely as I am...
C'mon. Let's go.
No, wait here.
They don't know. It was carefully planned. Earlier in the day the victims received anonymous passes to the movie.
Don't worry...
Whatever.
What if your life depended on it?
You're pretty when you're angry.
You are writing another book, aren't you? That's why you're here. The story's not over.
Watch your back.
Sig Ep's gotta band, tonight.
What?
Don't do this.
Nah...I think it'll die off. It's opening weekend. Let's see how it goes.
Please, I have the perfect excuse.
Gotta.
The crowd is really with the movie. Some even talk to the screen. "You dumb bitch. Get out of the house." etc.
Gee, let me think. "Do you want to..." Is that the best you can do? Some tired hand me down rehash? Hey, pal, no one's gonna write a book about you. No movie rights. Nothing. I've been through this before and much better I might add.
I get scared really easy, okay.
I guess Gale's going to be pissed she missed her exclusive.
And that CICI chick wasn't that bad either but I'm really concerned about my safety now.
Oh I wouldn't miss it for the world. I bet you did such a great job.
Heh heh I bet they are babe. I bet they are. Look, my battery's dying . . .
Hello.
Thanks.
Good bye Ben.
Very good. You follow directions well. Now for the final part of the game. Put down the bat and approach the sign, slowly.
Well if you won't work for me, will you work for the president?
Shit. Sarah Darling.  I interviewed her too. God, it's happening again isn't it Detective?
Deal, but I'm still Detective Kincaid,ok?
He killed Milton! The killer's  inside there! Oh God!  DEWEY! Dewey's in there too! He needs medical help! He's hurt!
I'm a homicide detective, remember?  When you see what I see day in and day out, the violence that people do to each other, you get haunted. I think you know about that.
I know what it's like to see ghosts that don't Go away.  To be watching a scary movie in your head, whether you want to or not,  watching it alone.
What Rielly?
Again, I am the author of the definitive book on the Woodsboro murders.!  What about you?
You said you'd never leave Woodsboro, 'The only place that's real!'  But now you're here. Not with me.  Dewey, I took care of you.  I waited until you were well.  I couldn't stay there, I mean, it's like dog years, one year in Woodsboro is like seven everywhere else.
Dewey, you're not just here because of that second rate K-Mart, straight-to-video version of me, are you?
All of what Dewey?  You do know something, don't you?
Someone stole Sid's file?
Right. Sorry.  Do you think he did it? 
And who is that?
Jennifer?! Wait, where are you going off to?
What?
Sid, this is detective Kincaid.
Just Jennifer.  And you.
Do you want us to come with you?
No point, I'm just gonna give Detective Kincaid a call.
Roman, from your enthusiasm it certainly seems that way.  Honestly though,  tell us, what's	your favorite scary movie?
Wait a second, whoa! Calm down! Number one there were five different versions of the script given out. Ben Damon was given a fake script because he was only being offered the role. It only had fragments of real scenes from the actual script. And what, I die in STAB 3?
I don't know. Screw them. Look, what's important is that we stick together. No matter what. If anyone is next it's you or me Jen.
I am Gale Weathers!
Gale Weathers would find a way. 
Milton's not a killer. He's a pervert. He probably went out to buy more KY JELLY for his jack -off parties he has with his two best friends.
Tom Prinze, tanked as usual. That's a shocker.
Heh, well, that's TV journalism for ya. Stage the news to boost ratings.
Hi, Gale. I'm glad you're all right.
All the nightmares. All the hell I went through was because of you, you spineless bastard!
Sarah, it's Roman, I'm sorry I'm running late, I'm still on the 405, I'm about 10 minutes away.
And still the film is Number One at the box office this weekend. Beat out American Pasty and Arlington Street.
Damn. He called my roommate and told her he had some important things he wanted to go over with me in his office tonight.
You sick fuck I'm tracing this call as we speak! The police are gonna nail your ass!
Yes.
I don't want them, I want you!  It's simple. You show yourself, they survive, you run, they die!
It's good to see you again Sidney. I was growing real impatient. Go ahead. Explore. I'll catch up with you later.
No one's saying you did.
I was just asking. Why are you always at me?
Oh...
You know it.
Yes, sir.
You sleep in THAT?
I'll only stay a sec.
Now that it's out of your system.
What's that?
Hey, hey, it's just me.
Understand what? That I got a girlfriend who would rather accuse me of being a psychopathic killer than touch me.
It's been a year since she died.
You lost your mom...
Sure it does. It's like Jodie Foster in SILENCE OF THE LAMBS when she kept having flashbacks of her dead father.
Why? WHY? Did you hear that, Stu? I think she wants a motive. Hmmm... I don't really believe in motives, Sid. I mean, did Norman Bates have a motive?
We did your mom a favor, Sid. The woman was a slut bag whore who flashed her shit all over town like she was Sharon Stone or something.
Who is this?
I'm sorry. I guess I dialed the wrong number.
I want to talk to you for a second.
You're making popcorn?
What's your favorite scary movie?
Is that the one where the guy had knives for fingers?
Don't hang up on me.
To talk.
They'd never make it in time.
TO SEE WHAT YOUR INSIDES LOOK LIKE.
No...
Come on. It'll be fun.
I can't think.
We're tracking the cellular phone bill.
Am I keeping you? I'm sorry.
You never know when or where a story will break.
Then what are you doing here?
Yes, you doofus.
She's with me. I just wanted to check on things.
He's not registered. Could he have gone to another hotel?
Somebody called me, Dewey. I'm not making it up.
And my Dad? Any word on him?
Afraid not.
How is everything?
Have you contacted the bureau?
She'll be with her friends over at Stu Maker's tonight.
The phone's dead.
Jesus! The camera-hurry!
When did that ever stop you? You can't sit on this. This is huge.
Just stay back.
I owe you shit.
Have you talked to Cotton?
If you hang up, you'll die just like your mother.
Oooooh... before or after he sliced and diced.
Working, thank you.
You got it.
Yeah, I'm off early -- curfew you know.  Now that's poor taste.
I had 'em hid in the foreign section.
I'll be right back.
Don't listen to him. It's him. He's the one.
Hey, Stu? Didn't you use to date Casey?
Are you kidding? This is like Christmas.
You guys can go up to my parents room? To talk and... whatever.
No way.
Later.
Created by that little tabloid twit Gale Weathers.
Come on, let's rock.
Where you guys been? We had to start without you.
There's nothing that says I have to work with him.  If Somerset wants out, "goodbye."  Give it to me.
Ease back, Mills.
So what?  This victim...
Hey, so gluttony is one of the seven deadly sins.  But, this was a fat guy.  The killer may have felt this was the just best way to torture him. And, writing on the walls happens all the time.  It's like the fashionable thing to do.
We figure you need all the tools you can get to fix up that piece of shit you call a house.
Who tied her down?  You or him?
Turn around.  Hands on your head!
Hello.
It's not too far away now.
NO!
Well, I'll be standing beside you the whole time, so you be sure to let me know when this whole, complete reality thing is done.  Wouldn't want to miss it.
And, why is that?
Okay... sure...  It's just that, with my old partner, you know...
Detective Mills here.  Honey... I asked you not to call me here. I'll call you back...  What?  Why?
Tonight.
Yeah.  Parts of them.  Anyway, in Purgatory, Dante and his buddy are climbing up that big mountain... seeing all these other guys who sinned...
Just wait!
It doesn't fit.  He doesn't want us to help him stop.
Oh, that's all.
Bullshit.
Yes.  They were there... so, it must be.
No.
Yes we do.  Here...
What does all that matter anyway?  It's not our job to figure him out, is it?  All we have to do is catching him.
Let's go.
Him?
What?  Assessing fines?
It's not what you think it is.
Saint Thomas Aquinas.  He wrote about the seven deadly sins.
I'm fine.
What the fuck is wrong with you?
These murders are his masterwork.  His sermon to all of us.  To all us sinners.
If we get him, I'll be happy enough.
No I'm not!  I'm talking about common, everyday life here.  If you let yourself worry about one thing, you'll worry about the next, and the next, and it never ends. In this place, ignorance isn't just bliss, it's a matter of survival.
That part of me is dead.
One of two things will happen.  We're either going to get John Doe, or he'll finish his series of seven, and this case will go on for years.
You and I are, probably for the first time ever, in total agreement.  He wouldn't just stop.
I can tell you this.  I recognize his lawyer.  His name's Mark Swarr.
Kiss me on the lips.
Don't do this... please...
I... I don't understand.
What?  Oh, yes.  I mean, thank you.  Please, sit down.
Too long.  What do you think so far?
Talk to him about it.  He'll understand if you tell him how you feel.
I want to have children.  It's just...
They gave up...went back to the cotton rows...So'd the Jamisons... Without Martha, I don't know...She wouldn't let a man quit.
It's not a sword, ma...It's a sabre!  Did you kill many damYankees with this sabre, Uncle Ethan?
Naw...a human man rides a horse till it dies...then he goes on afoot...A Comanche comes along...gets that horse up...and rides it twenty more miles...Then he eats it.
That'll be the day!...Let's ride.
Huh...? No...no water.
She sure is!...An' don't think your comin' back is goin' to change it!
AND other things...Mebbe you thought you was gettin' away with being comical about that Indian wife you took...I bet she wasn't the first squaw you...
I'm askin' as a Ranger of the sovereign state of Texas.
I thought we were trying to get the girls back -- <U>alive</U>...We jump those Comanches, they'll kill 'em...You know that!
Just keep goin'...
Comanches don't use their fists, reverend...Let 'em alone...
This an invite to a necktie party, Reverend?
Go ahead, son...But at the first alarm, we're comin' in -- and we ain't goin' to have time to pick and choose our targets when we do...
Oh...Now what's this your pa wants to know?
Grab hold!...
You lie! All white men lie...and kill...
These are my people...  Unnt-meah! Go! Go! <U>Please</U>!
Ain't been too good...No sir, not too good...Gettin' old, Ethan...
Scar's band was headin' north...to winter in at Fort Wingate...eatin' agency beef. That's what this buck said...Maybe he lied.
In that case you won't find her -- and I won't get my thousand dollars.
Ain't yours yet.
You've done a lot of growin'...
Stop callin' me 'uncle'...I ain't your uncle.
Easy!  It's forty miles, sonny...Horses can do with some grain and a little rest.
Good night...
YOUR cattle?...<U>DEBBIE'S</U> cattle!
Look!  Scar?...  Do you know where he went? And if he has a girl with him...a <U>white</U> girl -- nai-bist pabo taibo...
Peaceful tribes depend on the buffalo, too....
What'd the soldiers have to kill her for!..
I ain't sure...Where's that doll?
You breeds are all alike -- two drinks an'...
You don't remember it, but I remember. That was your mother's scalp!
You ever see it before...like mebbe on a dress Debbie wore?
Ain't worth the mendin'...
Shush!...Time for bed anyway...  Likely these'll need some takin' in...Oh, Martie, you're that gaunted! ...Ma's havin' a turkey for dinner tomorrow and...
One letter in five years...I read it till the paper dried up and the writing faded out...
It isn't fair...
We got two around that age...
You'll have to wait until we reach the agency...Fall in behind the column...
Come on, say it.  You know...
"With you, my life began and with you shall it end..."
Oh God, Tommi...
They say it's fantastic.  At least that's what I read in a men's magazine.  So who are the two lucky ones?
Oh, that was upstairs.  A real antiquity!  I think it's great.
Making our very own solstice fire.
We just have to make a new beginning.
What?
Not a book fair.  I was signing autographs in a department store.
So do I, believe me.
You know, it's not always easy for me, either.  But at least I try not to give in to each and every neurosis.
Come on, at least try one.  It took me two hours to make these.
It's simply too dangerous here! But no, you always have to have it your way.
...So he's dictating you a new bestseller?  Whatever that is, it's not our son.
Village gossip.  You're a real attraction here.
Not so bad, if I could get some peace and quiet around here.
Romeo and Juliet--just a suggestion.
Right you are, governor!
Then tomorrow you will have the pages.
No Juliet?!
Romeo
She had a cottage. One day, she was three months gone with child, so
yet cannot love nor write it.
Yes, I saw it.
Cut his nose off.
Partners!
A share of the profits.
What have I done, Mr. Fennyman?
The Apothecary? Will, what is the story? Where is the shipwreck? How does the comedy end?
Nobody knew!
I am so sorry, Mr. Henslowe. I wanted to be an actor.  I am sorry, Will.
Every word.
Rosaline? You mean Ethel.
Tomorrow
What? Who?
By God, Will, if you do not, who does? Let us have pirates, clowns, and a happy ending, or we will send you back to Stratford to your wife!
Well, there's a pirate  In truth, I have not written a word.
A different one you haven't written?
It would be better that you return tomorrow, my lord.
I am not so well-born.
All the men at court are without poetry. If they look at me they see my father's fortune. I will have poetry in my life. And adventure. And love. Love above all.
No . . . not the artful postures of love, but love that over- throws life. Unbiddable, ungovernable, like a riot in the heart, and nothing to be done, come ruin or rapture. Love like there has never been in a play.  I will have love or I will end my days as a . . .
Oh, but they can!
Why, Lord Wessex! Lost your wife so soon?
Lord Wessex, as I foretold, has lost his wife in the play- house--go make your farewell and send her out. It's time to settle accounts.  How much was the wager?
No, no, a touch of cold only. We suspect he is lying but WILL has turned away.
Is she obedient?
But the plague
The same, alas.
Oh--I am him too!
Oh, not for the world!
Can you love a player?
It is strange to me, too.
I must. Look-- how pale the window.
Oh--no, no!
Yes, this is not life, Will. This is a stolen season.
But I will go to Wessex as a widow from these vows, as solemn as they are unsanctified.
I am done with theatre. The playhouse is for dreamers. Look where the dream has brought us.
Orsinogood name
But why me?
The Queen has consented?
I will do my duty, my lord.
It is not my riding day, my lord.
Thomas Kent. I would like to do a speech by a writer who commands the heart of every player.
If you love her, you must do what she asks.
Does she say so?
Yes, my aunt. But perhaps she wept a little. Tell me how you love her, Will.
Deeper. Softer. None of your twittering larks! I would banish nightingales from her garden before they interrupt her song.
Yes, by God! Love knows nothing of rank or riverbank! It will spark between a queen and the poor vagabond who plays the king, and their love should be minded by each, for love denied blights the soul we owe to God! So tell my lady, William Shakespeare waits for her in the garden!
Are you bringing your laundry woman?
A theatre poet?
Or maybe just phone out for a pizza?
Just serve.
Will you shut up and play.
Discussion group, Alex, discussion.
Why, thank you, David.
Think about it.
Come on, David.
Juliet?
All right, then, go ahead, telephone. Telephone the police. Try again. No one's going to stand in your way. Go ahead. Tell them there's a suitcase of money and you don't want it.
Dig the pit, I don't know.
We all are, David, we're all going to do it. Each of us, you, me and Juliet, will do his or her bit. Is that fair enough?
Is this necessary?
I want to talk now.
You think so?
No, it doesn't. I tried to let it worry me but it won't. I've worked on that paper for three years. There is a pensioner's terror ordeal on page six every day. Every day. Maybe when I'm a pensioner it'll worry me.
I fitted a lock up there. On the inside.
Secure it? What do you mean -- you're gong to take it to a bank? You're not going to take it to a bank? You're not going to take it to a bank Or what, you want to bury it? Is that it?
We just wanted to speak to you.
I beg your pardon?
Yeah, I was phoning your mother.
Not at all.
Where do you think you'll go?
I don't know anything about it.
Cover it?
But there's no --
That's because he is. Does that upset you?
What?
I mean, what are you actually doing here? What is the hidden agenda?
She hated you --
He seemed like a nice guy, Alex.
What? Oh, yeah, sure, if you want. I tell you, every letter this guy writes to you is the same: they all begin like pure love and descend into open pornography. I dream of your thighs, the soft touch of your white skin leading me in desire, while I, aroused and inflamed --'
No, Alex, we don't really love you.
So I gathered.
So what's wrong with that?
Alex, how shouldI know? I'm just a girl.
Yes.
Yes.
Old newspaper proverb says dead human being is living story. Be rational, please, and failing that be quiet.
And now you tell me.
Who was it?
Are you all right?
Because that's no good. Remember, we did what we did, we took the money. It was a material calculation. But what's the use if it's underground, or in some funny bank in some funny place? If you can't spend it, if you can't have it, what use is it? None. It's nothing, all for nothing, if you do that. I didn't get into this for nothing, so that I could have nothing --
He can't stay up there.
Yeah, he's got to go to work, hasn't he? You think he'll come down for that?
David?
No.
Well, I'm not expecting anyone either.
You're frightened.
The perfect couple, I should say.
Let him go. Let him take it all.
I see.
You mean I can have the room?
And the other three people on the flat, did they hear anything?
Who said there were four?
No, three. Who said there were four?
Keep it going, Alex. You're unstoppable now.
Yes.
No.
With a face like this?
That's right. You're going to Rio. Rio de Janeiro. On your own. Come on, you should know. You bought the fucking ticket.
Right here?
Eh --
I'm not sure --
I'm boring?
Oh, I see, I thought you meant --
That's what I thought.
You must be Juliet.
Would you like to see the rest?
A certain weakness.
You know about it?
And that's not the same thing?
And you said you supposed so, but I wasn't offering it for debate.
Yeah, baby. Things are great. Listen, there's Devra, whatta you want?
Who?
It's just -- fabulous.  Think you could do anything for me?
No.
My keys.
Listen, baby, don't leave, really.
It turned out to be cancer.
So what are you doing going over there? You're not her doctor.
-- What?
I don't want to place you in any position --
I'm coming, baby --  How's Otis doing, anyway?
What kind of treatment?
I hope she's all right.
And I certainly wouldn't tell Lester.
Hello, George.
Right now, I just don't care.
She's a friend of Jill's.
... what?...
No, baby. Now look, that girl that called -- I have to talk to her, she'll do something.
Yeah.
... yeah.
You don't have to make conversation with me, I'm not my mother... do you have a thing about older women... that's sort of faggoty isn't it?
She is.
Great.
Look, Mr. Roundy, why don't you make out a financial statement? It'll save us both some time. Miss Michaels here can show you... have it notarized and we'll see where we go from there. Miss Michaels, would you get me a couple of forms?
Oh fuck, Norman!
Look, Norman, I'm not the shampoo girl.
Jackie, would you argue with your doctor.
Do you? You still see him?
Yeah?
What are you talking about?
That son of a bitch, everything he says is a phony piece of shit, what does he think, I'm some cigar butt he's got between his teeth --
You were great.
No you didn't.
You were great.
We're friends.
No --
It's too late...
What's that supposed to mean?
Don't go, Jackie...
Don't leave me...
-- please, please forgive me...
Hey, stop by the shop.
What're you talking about?
What?
Nobody's gonna get you but me!
I am?
Yeah, baby.
We live together now.
-- Sure.
Great.
Hello.
How did it go at the bank?
Could I?
Just a second, I'll be right with you...
I'll call you.
Neither do I, baby.
Where's your car?
I don't want to fight either. Look... uh -- I love you.
What is.
I'm very tired, George.
Let go of me.
Oh, Christ.
-- tell me something -- did you talk about me?
Yeah, I know. Did you?
Did you?
Yeah, little election party I'm giving at the Bistro. It's a pain in the ass but -- I have to do it. We'll have a little time to talk there.
I know what you mean.
That's okay, that's okay, just shut the door.
It's nerve wracking sometimes... women can get you very upset.
I don't know what to...
Yeah.  How long have you been here?
Look, Lester... are you unhappy with me about something?
But...
Oh Jesus Christ.
What, do you think I planned it?
Oh, fuck, Lester, how should I know?
What about her?
Yes I do.
No.
I'll call you back.
Yeah.
I'll call you back.
So I can't talk to some broken down actor, what do you think, I'm going to tell him I'm screwing Lester Karpf!
That's not very logical, Lester.
Oh, I'm sorry.
They're Yorkies and they don't shed.
Jesus, she's my best friend.
Yes, Jackie Shawn, my wi -- Felicia.
Who is that?
I know, I'm sorry.
Well, it's George.
But you have problems?
Jackie --
Quite a while... an hour, an hour and a half -- sometimes forty-five minutes -- that's quite a while, isn't It?
-- When you say forty-five minutes or an hour, do you mean continuous time? Just continually, without stopping?
-- I was in the kitchen doing the dishes and George was out in Long Beach doing a show...
I see. You mean he just sort of fucks you.
I'm telling you he won't know the difference.
Please don't misunderstand... I'd really like to go.
What was the Donner party?
What do you mean?
Yes, Dad.
Chocolate it shall be.  Come on son.
Tony.
Do they know he tell you things?
Now think real hard, Doc.  Think.
Is there something bad here?
You're scared of Room 237, ain'tcha?
Danny, come on over here.
All right.
Okay...oh!
No.
Come on, Doc.  He only went to bed a few hours ago.  Can't you wait till later?
Danny!
Why not?
Thank you.
Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah, he seems absolutely fine now, but you should have seen him.
Mrs. Torrance, most of the time these episodes with kids are never explained.  They are brought on by emotional factors, and they rarely occur again.
Did Tony's first appearance happen to coincide with your arrival here?
Fine.
Yes, sir.
That's right, sir.
Your son has a very great talent. I don't think you are aware how great it is, but he is attempting to use that very talent against your will.
Will you indeed, Mr. Torrance.
Thank you very much.  I'll do that.
Good evening Mr. Torrance.
What time is it?
Yeah... that's all it is.
Yes.
Yes.
Which room was it?
Good.
I think he did it to himself.
Wendy!
Darling, light of my life, I'm not going to hurt you.  You didn't let me finish my sentence.  I said 'I'm not going to hurt you... I'm just going to bash your brains in!'  I'm going to bash them right the fuck in.
Give me the bat.
Go away.
Yes?
Nice to meet you, Mr. Ullman.
Oh, no problem at all.  I made the trip in three and a half hours.
Well, my predecessor in this job
shut in together over long periods of time.
Oh!
Oh, I'll say.
Thank you, Susie.
Fine.
I don't accept the idea that he knows who his letter writer is, Jane. Because I don't accept the idea that there was a big bad wolf who saw Marty in his wheelchair.
Come on, Jane- it was Brady's idea. I couldn't stop him.
A new pair of panty hose. Is it enough?
Jane-
Okay, okay. Dwight Evans.
Yeah.
What if it's some kind of monster?
But you are, you know- you are my dear boy.
It really goes fast. Thanks, Uncle Al.
I don't get you.
Sure.
What the hell does that matter?
Marty, Marty, you should hear yourself!
You're not going to let it go, are you?
But Uncle Al! You said-
-and Babcock, I remember. Now go on!
Yeah, you learned a whole lot, I can tell.
What about crack?  You a user?
LET THY SOUL BE HEALED
And you listen to that?
Mary Robert, don't panic.  Remember what we talked about?  Experience?
You said that?  And what did he say? Did he say you could leave her?  Did he say we'd be happy?
Yes?
And to say you're sorry.  About this afternoon.  And the things you said. Forgotten.  Completely.  Do you understand?  Forgotten.
Good evening, Vincent.
Oh my! 
Sure is!  Come on in, and sing a spell.
Chops?
The Dixie Cups?  Oh my.  I was just a girl.  Of course.  SPRING IS HERE THE SUN WILL SHINE
And we know that, even though most people would call you a leech and a parasite, the lowest slug of humanity! We know that deep down inside, you're probably even worse.  And so you truly need our prayers.
Enough jabber.
Um, I don't really know this one...
Free-lance?  Oh really?  You think I don't see?  You think I took vows yesterday?  I know what you're up to. You and Reverend Mother.
I hear you.  How many days a week do you rehearse?
Well... see, at my old convent, I wasn't always... real popular.  I was sort of selfish and... not real helpful.  Okay, I'll say it -- I wasn't much of a nun. But now, thanks to all of you... maybe I'm shaping up.
You re okay -- for a civilian.
Five a.m.?
I... I...
What?
It's part of St. Katherine's new community outreach program.  How old are you?  You shouldn't be smoking.  Have you ever seen a diseased lung?  Hand 'em over.
Experience!  Right?
Good point.  Especially that dude you were with.  I'd like to see him down front.
Mary Clarence!
Oh no.  We'll always be together.
I was expelled!  When I was fifteen?
What?
What? 
A what?
My what?
Our lives are simple.  We have little need for material possessions.
And whom would you call?
I'm sure.  If I were you, I would use this time, to think about my life.  And its direction.  Or lack thereof.
From all I've heard, just about everything.  Your singing career seems all but nonexistent, and your married lover wants you dead. 
Girls, this is Sister Mary Clarence. She'll be minding you until Sister Mary Patrick's return.  Mary Clarence, please assign a biblical passage.  Do not attempt discussion.  Am I understood?
Mary Clarence!
I am?
And I am refusing.  As of tomorrow, Mary Lazarus will resume her leadership of the choir.
Indeed.  After how long?  A few weeks? I have been here thirty years.  And yet, it would seem, I know nothing.
You have evidenced great maturity, Mary Robert.  We shall have a serious discussion.
At least he's not a cop.  At least he can afford a decent gift.
It's a convent.  All you have to do is shut up, behave yourself, and get along.
But Vince has contacts all over the place!  This is San Francisco!  They'll be looking for me!
Keeping our witnesses alive.  We hide them, but there's a leak in the department, and they end up dead.
But it's a nightmare!  Mother Superior is out to get me!  She hates my guts! She keeps thinking up new kinds of torture!
You blew it -- big time.  She doesn't want you back.
She's counting on it.  She's concerned for your safety, but she wants me to try and find another convent that will take you. Or a carnival.
You're supposed to be hiding out!
Jesus, look at you   You're glowing.
No -- worried about you.  Personally.
You re sort of... radiant.   your eyes are shining.  You're rea1ly different...
You're gonna be singing for St. Peter if you don't get your ass out of here!
Hail, Mary.
Really.
They open a window.
You found him -- but we're not open yet.
Not... totally.
That's what I figured, too.
Maybe we can get some of the local kids to sing with us.
We'll pray -- and she'll be there.
She wasn't a nun?
And you'll face that danger head-on.  As if I could stop you.  And you have my complete support in this matter. Anything you can do to revitalize this neighborhood would be a blessing.
She did.  Bring her back.  Now.  For a talk.
Many have.
Must have been the Redman.  A Lenape Indian lives in the Western Woods.
How did you hear this?
Well, unless your name is Baltus, you should not worry over mine.
I do not care.  You are welcome to use my work area, but I beg you... return her to her resting place.
What of it?
All I know is three are slain, their heads found severed from their bodies...
I cannot proceed without examining the previous victims.
Then, you should have left two days ago, because I have men willing to help me today.
They need guidance.
Damn you, sir!  God damn you to hell!
Van Ripper and his wife agreed to take him.  They have children and a good home and good land.
No, you listen!  You may think we are a pack of superstitious dullards...
Up.
The Western Woods.
Yes... I suppose it is.  Keep it.
I have others.  All I need is this.
"Let loose his silent shrieking." Who knows, till we work at it?  I admit not being anxious to find out.  "He who holds the Horseman's desire will guide his reaping hand." Whatever the Horseman's desire is, other than extinguishing lives.
True enough.
Man or woman?
There are none for Magistrate Philipse either.  "Paasch, James" "Pieter, Thomas" "Pos, William."
Something I really wish I had not seen. Never mind it.  Did you find the victims' loan agreements?
I... I am looking for Baltus Van Tassel.
Extra ordinary, yes.  But first, you tell me about the Headless Horseman.
Are you so superstitious?
Don't you see why?  Look closely a moment.  Put your intellect aside.  Can't you see what is inexplicable?
That would be a pity.  Those words might show you something you've never seen before.
No stone may be left unturned.  It may appear harsh...
You are not regarding it in full. The Widow Windsor had been run through by a sword.  I followed the bloodless wound, a wound whose path I could not comprehend till I had seen the Horseman with my own eyes.
I have no solution for its meaning yet, but I could not just ignore it.
What troubles you?
What?
She died.  Her lungs were diseased... two years ago.  What is this about?
What did you say?
I'm drawing bad blood from the wound.
The loans give the land to your father. It does not matter survivors are still on their farms.  They could be thrown off... tomorrow... a year from now.
I do not know.  Away.
No.  Get to the crest of the roof and be ready to jump.
No.  She has gone out.
Let her go!
Close your mouth!  Keep silent.
No one will believe your lies, whore.
May I see my mother?
Wait up, I'll leave with you and lock up.
Now it's minimal wage and there ain't nothin' but a army cot and a toilet back there.
I've tinkered around on 'em a little bit.
You got any money?
See there. Thinks of the simplest thing first.
Scooter, let's me and you go over to Dairy Queen and pick up a few things for lunchtime.
No, don't guess I do.  Scooter, good to meet you.  This is him, the one I talked to you about on the phone. Now like I said, I'll understand if you get nervous about it. I'm not gonna lie to you now, he did get in that trouble but then he was real young.
Give me the big'uns.
I'll help you tote 'em if I don't give out first.
I figured that. Well you better be careful with that cripple in the back. You'll throw him out. Looks like you got a wagonful.
You sure are hung up on people bein' sweet.  Speakin' of which, where's your girlfriend? I thought he was comin' by here for something.
Karl, you better clap your hands or he'll just keep on.
But honey, I'll be good. I promise. I love you sweetie. I'm just tryin' to help these two be part of things.
Don't tell me what to do.
Don't tell me what to do.
Naw, hell, let them stay here with me and do men things. There might be some kind of ball game on we can watch. You go on.
That ain't none of your damn bidness. Besides that's the way friends do one another. Fuck it, I'm gonna go call 'em. Honey, find my guitar, I think it's out there in the garage with that loony tune.
Karl can stay if he wants to. Mama said --
I thought I told you to keep out!
Childers.
Different ones. One's the Bible. One of 'ems a book on Christmas. One of 'ems how to be a carpenter.
I killed some folks quite awhile back. They said I wadn't right in the head and they put me in there in the nervous hospital instead of puttin' me in jail.
I never was much count at it. I never did get picked out fer it.
Yeah it is. Your name's Frank.
You told me to come by.
All right then.
You don't need to know all of that. You're just a boy. You need to think about good thoughts while you're still a boy. They'll be plenty of time for the other.
Why did he do that, reckon.
Yeah, I did.
Two people.
I thought they was.
You ort not to talk that way. You're just a boy.
That's than un on Christmas I was tellin' you about.
All right then.
I bet he will. I got a little money if he don't. I'll get 'em for ye.
That's real good. You ort not to if ye ain't married to somebody. Bible tells you that much. Hit tells some things that don't seem right too, I reckon. I guess a feller ort to foller it close as he can, though.  You don't touch yourself, do you?
You ort not to pull on yourself that away.
He ain't no count.
Yes sir. Right then it was.
You don't want to give away all your books.
You know I would. Whatever you want.
Okay.
Hey, sweetheart. What you up to?
Frank told me about your situation. And Frank loves company. You know, especially after his daddy passed and all. There ain't no sense in you stayin' in that old greasy shop.  He's mentally retarded, poor thing.
Mama?
He's lyin' Mama. He ain't gonna do better.
I ain't got no boy.
I told you, I ain't got no boy, now get on out from here and let me be.
Yes, I guess you are.
You better go get 'em.
Yes sir.
I told 'em about it. They know I'm well. That Mizz Wheatley made me some biscuits.
Tolerable, I reckon.
I didn't aim to.
No ma'am.
Thank ye.  I'm just getting around to tellin' you, but I fixed your warshin' machine.
How long have you been standing here?
I mean tomorrow or the next day.
Not funny, ha, ha, funny queer.
I ain't a-stayin'. I need to ast you fer a favor.
Vaughan, don't get pushy.
I hope the best for you, Miss Dwiggins, with your school and your paper and all.
Wonderful. When your next book is published, maybe you could come into the store and do a signing. I'm sure we could get a lot of people to show up.
Perhaps I should rephrase the question. What I mean to say is, are you married or seriously involved with a significant other?
I wouldn't actually call it a party. It's more along the lines of a dinner in celebration of my birthday.  The guest list is quite restricted. So far, there's Mr. Benjamin and myself. If you accept, that would make three of us.
Three's a crowd. Yes, I'm aware of that. But I have to keep an eye on Mr. Benjamin wherever he goes. To make sure he doesn't get himself into trouble.
Better make it charge. 
I confess.
It looks worse than it is. I'm okay.
For me?  I'll have the same thing. 
What's that, Sol?
The Queen of England?
No problem. It's not as though I'm rushing off to the opera or anything.
It's mine all right. I've owned that little sucker for a long time.
Well, let's not exaggerate. I take pictures. You line up what you want in the viewfinder and click the shutter. No need to mess around with all that artisto crap.
I mean, you're going too fast. You're hardly even looking at the pictures.
They're all the same, but each one is different from every other one. You've got your bright mornings and your dark mornings. You've got your summer light and your autumn light. You've got your weekdays and your weekends. You've got your people in overcoats and galoshes, and you've got your people in shorts and T-shirts. Sometimes the same people, sometimes different ones. And sometimes the different ones become the same, and the same ones disappear. The earth revolves around the sun, and every day the light from the sun hits the earth at a different angle.
It's Ellen. Look at her. Look at my sweet darling.
Help? Hmm. It's possible. What did you have in mind?
Hey, kid. You interested in a job? I just got word from your employment agency that you're looking for a position in retail sales.
Fuck you, kid.
Cops? You mean they nabbed those cruds?
Nothing much. He said his socks and underpants were dirty, and would we mind driving up with his things.  Fucking kids, huh? They take you for granted every time.
It's Tommy's. The sucker owed me a favor.
Hi, Auggie.
Yeah, I know, but I'm trying to cut down.  Somebody's worried about my health.
Christmas stories? Sure, I know a ton of 'em.
You got it.
Okay.  So this is the story of how it happened.  Okay.  It was the summer of 'seventy-six, back when I first started working for Vinnie. The summer of the bicentennial.  A kid came in one morning and started stealing things from the store. He's standing by the rack of paperbacks near the front window stuffing skin magazines under his shirt. It was crowded around the counter just then, so I didn't see him at first....
Anything for art, eh, Paul?
And now you've got your Christmas story, don't you?
Why would I lie to you, Auggie? You think it was easy to come here and walk into this place? Why would I do it if I didn't have to?
Then why do you think I married Frank? I was already pregnant, and I didn't have much time. Say what you like, but at least he gave my kid a name.
Who the hell knows?  He dropped out of sight fifteen years ago.
You what?
And what's that supposed to mean?
You told me you wanted to meet him. Well,here he is.
Yeah? And what else am I supposed to do? There's no baby anymore, and if she wants to throw away her life, that's her business.
Dream on, Auggie. She'll be lucky to make it to her nineteenth birthday.
Are you calling me a liar? I'm telling you I'm broke. I don't even have insurance on my goddamned car.
Why don't you open it and find out?
Anything, Auggie. Just name it.
No problem, Vinnie. Everything's under control.  I could run this store in my sleep.
I don't know.  Maybe because I love you so much, boss.
She made a play for me after I got back, but her glass eye kept interfering with my concentration. Every time we got into a clinch, I'd start thinking about that hole in her head, that empty socket with the glass eye in it. An eye that couldn't see, an eye that couldn't shed any tears. The minute I started thinking about it, Mr. Johnson would get all soft and small. And I can't see getting married if Mr. Johnson isn't going to be in tiptop shape.
Enjoy it while you can, Vin. Pretty soon, they're going to legislate us out of business anyway.
Come around to the cigar store tomorrow morning at ten o'clock and we'll talk about it, okay? We'll see what we can work out.
This way, gentlemen. Let's retire to my office, shall we?
Huh?
Thanks for the tip.
You mean Rashid?
He doesn't go to the Trinity School?
You mean she just ran off with him and left her little boy behind?
And he's never tried to get in touch with his son?
It's a free country, isn't it? As long as I'm not trespassing on your property. I can stay here till kingdom come.
I'm not going to rob you, mister.  Do I look like a thief?
It'll cost you five bucks.
Not a one.
What's your offer?
Are you making fun of me? I won't be mocked. Do you hear me? I won't let no punk kid stand there and mock me!
Louisa Vail. Remember her, Cyrus?
Help? What the fuck do I need your help for? I've got a man, don't I? That's more than you can say for yourself, Hawkeye.
Yeah, well, there ain't no baby in there now. You dig? There's nothing in there now.
I don't know, Tommy. You think anyone gives a rat's ass about Kuwait? I read something about the head sheik over there. He marries a different virgin every Friday and then divorces her on Monday. You think we want to have our kids dying for a guy like that?
Huh?
Tick-tock, tick-tock.
Yes it is. It's a law of the universe. If I let you walk away, the moon will spin out of orbit ... pestilence will reign over the city for a hundred years.
That's okay. I've already had lunch.
That's true. But I also owe you something, and I'm not sure that buying you a hamburger is going to do the job.  What is it? Family problems? Money problems?
In Manhattan?
In case you're wondering, I like women, not little boys. And I'm not offering you a long-term lease -- just a place to crash for a couple of nights.
But then you don't get to watch the ball games. You told me you were a Mets fan.
Eight-thirty?
I'm sorry. They just... they just slipped out of my hands.
Twenty dollars is a lot of money. Are you sure you can trust me with it? I mean, aren't you afraid I might steal it?
It just won't do, will it? I go two and a half years without being able to write a word, and then, when I finally get started on something, when it looks as though I might actually be coming to life again, you show up and start breaking everything in my house. It just won't do, will it?
It sounds like our time is up, doesn't it?
Are you going to be all right?
I don't know. For helping me out.
You don't really want to know.
Maybe. Or maybe it's the other people who don't belong.
Fair enough. We wouldn't want to get carried away, would we?  Now call your aunt Em and let her know you're alive.
Come on, just a little hint.
The inspiration.
Excuse me for asking, but you aren't married, are you?
Nice try. You had me going for a second, but no ... no writer would ever do a thing like that.  Would he?
That's it. In a nutshell.
It wasn't my fault.
Wow. They sure did a job on you.
Yes, please.
...<u>might</u> do the same.  I have to warn you 'bout that, chief.  I'm not screwed together like I used to be.
Didn't say I was buyin' did I? What you want down?  Just bein' curious, is all.
No, but as I say, the type is rare. Ten percent of Caucasian males.
That's obvious.
Carl held it <u>for</u> 'em.  Called it a lease.  They make payments every June and December...
Just showed up at my door, big as life and twice as mean.  Wanted to talk to my son.
Well.  Every time I see him in town or somewhere, he's starin' at me with these narrow eyes. Givin' me his mean face.
A thousand.
Unwritten rule of the sea.  We don't bother each other, stick to ourselves. Ask anybody.
It seems human.  To me.
I lie to my parents every day. And every night.
Look, I <u>want</u> to forget you, I do. I think if you hold me, just this once, I can walk away and never speak to you again.
I did.  But the jury won't s...
What else?  I had the boy teach me kendo.  Including...the importance of the bow.
These are fishermen, Alvin.  They don't talk at all to each other and less to me.  Specially gossip.
And the next one...?
You bet.  And if Miyamoto there had been in a hurry to cast off, he coulda left this line behind on Carl's boat.
Pretty darn clear.
All right.  What did your son <u>say</u> to that effect?
Objection!
Twelve.
Oh, yeh.  He said someday he would get his land back.
He said he didn't want that life no more.  He'd been saving to buy a farm.  He was sorry I got sick. But pretty excited to get back his father's place.
I slept til one-thirty, when my wife woke me up with the news.  We talked for a few hours.  I left at six and went straight to my boat.
Shorthard the radio transmis- sions, write 'em up, file 'em in a cabinet.  Nobody ever looks. Just take up space.
To my father.  Everything counts.
That's what Mr. Miyamoto reported, and he'd have no reason to lie. He couldn't know that it would help his case.
Still lashed to the mast.
The knife.  What knife?
The sheriff and the deputy and I inspected the deck closely.  We found a small fracture in the wood of the gunnel.  Just below the mast.
We have a warrant.  To search your boat.
I think you like learning.
You're wonderin'...how come I never ask.  If you did it.
I told your wife.  Trials aren't always so much about actual truth. As about what folks <u>believe</u> is true. That's sad.  And it's real.
Yessir, there'd been real heavy fog.
Didn't think about it at the time. So no, it didn't strike me odd.
No.
Apparently.
She's alright, Nels, thanks for asking.
Which you inferred was replaced by the D-6, which must have been a spare.
If the head was moving fast enough, but I don't see how it could be.
Yes, you can tell me about the minor cut you found on the deceased's right hand.  The report says 'recent origin'.  How recent?  As much as 24 hours before death?
<u>Yes</u>, I'm sure.
He had no reason to.
That's all he said.
Spirit?                          Oh!  You mean "AQ"..."aggressive qualities"?
I suppose you want a tip?
Bull fiddle.
Clarinet - drums - trumpet - trombone -
It's entirely mutual.
A what?
Manhattans?  This time of night?
Like I was telling you - Little Bonaparte is getting soft.  He doesn't have it here any more.  Used to be like a rock.  Too bad.  I think it's time for him to retire.
What are you worried about?  This job is going to last a long time.
Don't look now - but the whole town is under water!
Shut up, will you?  I wonder how much Sam the Bookie will give up for our overcoats?
With you.
Don't you remember?  He has this bad tooth - it got impacted - the whole jaw swole up -
- Type O.
Now you're talking!  We pick up a couple of second-hand wigs - a little padding here and there - call ourselves Josephine and Geraldine -
I'll think of something.  Don't crowd me.
We are going out of town.  But we're going to shave.
Must be the way their weight is distributed. Come on.
The name is Josephine.  And it was your idea in the first place.
I never did like the name Geraldine.
Tore off one of my chests.
You better come help me.
Down, Daphne!
Good night, Josephine.
It's not my fault.  I didn't invite them.
You wouldn't hit a girl, would you?
You promised - the minute we hit Florida, we were going to beat it.
All right, all right!  But how long can we keep this up?
Don't get burned, Daphne.
Yes - you have to be very careful about picking a roommate.
Of course, you're not.  I'm going.
He's going to be ashore with you.
Oh, no.  I'm not getting caught in a miniature sand trap with that guy.
I am.
Security.
But Joe - this may be my last chance to marry a millionaire!
Daphne got a proposal tonight.
Get it while you're young.  And you better fix your lips.  You want to look nice for Osgood, don't you?
Hello, Room 414?  This is the ship-to-shore operator - I have a call for Miss Sugar Cane.
No tricks, no mirrors, nothing up my sleeve.  It's on the level this time.
We'll walk.  And if we have to, we'll starve.
We're not on the pier yet -
I wanted to thank you for covering for me. You're a real pal.
If it hadn't been for you, they would have kicked me off the train.  I'd be out there in the middle of nowhere, sitting on my ukulele.
Maybe I'd better go before I catch something.
You got some?
Half-full.
Oh, Sugar.  You're going to spoil my surprise.
We'll rent some at the bathhouse. How about you, Josephine?
Oh yes, we do!
Believe it or not - Josephine predicted the whole thing.
I hope so.
This is our manager, Mr. Bienstock. I'm Sweet Sue.
Help yourself.
Well, pull in your reel, Mr. Fielding. You're barking up the wrong fish.
Sorry.  I'll be on the bandstand.
They got a Cuban band that's the berries. Why don't we go there - blindfold the orchestra - and tango till dawn?
You're a pretty hot little firecracker yourself.
Sorry.
Osgood - I can't get married in your mother's dress.  She and I - we' not built the same way.
We're just a couple of musicians - we come to pick up a car - Nellie Weinmeyer's car - there's a dance tonight -  Come on, Jerry.
Nellie baby, I'll make it up to you.
My car?  Why, you -
Nellie, get me long distance.  What is it?
You got to be under twenty-five -
No, just dumb.  If I had any brains, I wouldn't be on this crummy train with this crummy girls' band.
Have you ever been with a male band?
That's what I'm running away from. I worked with six different ones in the last two years.  Oh, brother!
You see, I have this thing about saxophone players.
Every time!
That's why I joined this band. Safety first.  Anything to get away from those bums.
You're entitled.
Yeah.  With money like Rockefeller, and shoulders like Johnny Weismuller -
Glasses?
Well, now that you've mentioned it -
I hope this time you wind up with the sweet end of the lollipop.
Good night, Sugar.
Forget it, Sugar, will you?  Forget about saxophone players.  You're going to meet a millionaire - a young one.
Just my feminine intuition.
She doesn't need one.  I don't have one either.
Why?
You're society girls?
Good school!  And your family doesn't object to your career?
I only come ashore twice a day - when the tide goes out.
If it's at all possible -
What?
Shell Oil, Junior.  He's got millions - he's got glasses - and he's got a yacht.
Maybe you'd better go after him - if you don't want to lose him.
Just regulation size.  We have three like this.
Mother keeps hers in Southampton - and Dad took his to Venezuela - the company is laying a new pipe line.
Of course.  On Thursdays, they always serve me in the small salon.
Caught him off Cape Hatteras.
Well, I don't know how to put it - but I have this thing about girls.
It's more like a mental block.  When I'm with girls, it does nothing to me.
Oh, no!
I must be - because your glasses are beginning to steam up.
Mineral baths - now really!
Oh, you know - Junior League - charity bazaars - I used to sell kisses for the Milk Fund.
I'm going to see him again tonight - and every night - I think he's going to propose to me - as soon as he gets up his nerve.
It's all rather complicated - what we call high finance - but it so happens that the president of the Venezuelan syndicate has a daughter, and -
Well, anchors aweigh, you have a bon voyage.  And if you need an orchestra to play at your wedding, we'll be through here in a couple of weeks.
He was the first nice guy I ever met in my life - and the only one who ever gave me anything.
I know.  Every time!
Me?  I'm just a customer here.
If you want to, you can call your lawyer.
I cut myself shaving.
What for?
What is it, Spats?  What do you want here?
Theres finally a reason for the whole world to revolve around you?
Except its Scotch.
Pub Golf?
What? Why? What do you mean?
Are you sure youre okay?
Or Kat....
Im not as square as my daughter thinks.
I figured you could pick up your car tomorrow.
Other than, hes shagging your exgirlfriend?
And you do now?
Relax. Take a breath and just say it. Its no big deal. I promise.
Well, it was a big deal. As late as...yesterday. Or this morning.  But not anymore.
Youre funny.
Mmm, nice dress? Or mmm--  Gorgeous, I was insane to let you go!
On the nose.  I tell you what, because youre so cute, Ill take care of our incidentals.
If it makes you feel any better, to get your number, I had to cough up two round-trip tickets to Amsterdam and a case of mini-Baileys.
I have a different story for every woman who asks. I look at her and figure out what she needs to hear to feel okay about being with me.
Admit it. You were disturbed, but ultimately moved.
Okay.
Oh, come on. Youre like the Yoda of escorts.
Ive got this bad taste in my mouth. What is it? I think its the words: morally repugnant.
Of course not. How...how could it be? Nothing happened.
Not dollars. Pounds.
Oh, cut the crap!
Sure, but its never easy. They say theyre okay with it, and they are...for a while. Then one day, theyre not.
Spontaneously combust?
Youre judging me?! Oh, thats a good one. Youre lying to me, youre lying to your family, and youre lying to yourself. But youre going to stand there and point a finger at me? The man you hired to pretend to be your boyfriend?
Go ahead, Kat. Hate me. You were running out of steam on the whole Jeffrey thing. Maybe now youll be able to hold onto this just long enough to ruin your next relationship.
You have more than one gynecologist?
Therapist.
Give it back? Are you nuts?
Its complicated, Dad.
Just drunk enough.
You don't live around here, do you?
Sometime, but not like this.
Me and Sounder went to this prison camp to see my Daddy and the police guard runs us away and I fell on some glass.
That's right--
What's his name?
He'll get his place too -- now off with your clothes and into bed.
You could? How?
My daddy likes to look into the dark, even when there ain't nothin to see -- it's what you hear he say.
NO! N-O, NO!
I did look, Charlie, but I--
Charlie, you have no legal right not to let this boy know where his father is! You hear that, you and this whole damn court house; what you are doing is wrong!
Here, put my jacket over you.
It was too dark, Daddy.
You oughta be tired, too, Sounder. That possum shore whipped the hell outta you tonight!
I wanna go -- the trip don't bother me none.
Hi, Daddy...
He'll show up one day.
I don't know, son -- they won't tell us things like that -- but I don't want y'all to come here no more.
What happened afta that?
We goin' huntin' again, Daddy !?
I cleaned and oiled all your stuff while you was gone...
Mornin', Daddy...
September 4 -- how far away is that?
Let me tell you somethin', boy! I don't care if both of my legs was cut off! I can do more work in that field, than you could in a hundred years!
Never heard of 'im. We gotta lotta men here...
I don't look like no possum!
That's right!
Yes mam...
David, come back here!
No mam -- I looked all over.
Listen, Mama...
Good night...
Yes, mam...
I guess they musta sent 'im to another camp.
Yes, ma'm...
If I tell you I didn't, David, that's what I mean.
I don't know a damn thing, now stop bothering me about it!
I'm used to it.
And if they saw me pitch the way I did today -- they'd hire me just to strike out Babe Ruth!
Any time it's Saturday and I don't hafta do any work, I'm doin' okay!
Because he cared so damn much about you and me, child.
I'll wait till after the children.
It's lunchtime, and I wanna have a talk with you, Nathan Lee. Come on, children...
Yeah, he'll crawl into my bed tonight, lie close to my body and keep me warm -- and rectify the evil in the men who live over us in this valley.
Uh, can I finish? Can I finish? ...The fact is that we Canadians are quite surprised by your outrage-
Can I finish? Hello? Can I finish? ...The United States has graphic images of violence on television all the time, what is that one show? COPS? And car crashes caught on tape? We can't believe that a movie with some foul language and fart jokes would piss you off so much.
Can I finish? Please? Can I finish? ... ... Uh... Okay, I'm finished.
Pillow.
That's right, Mr. Garrison. The environment is what surrounds us. It is what we live and breathe.
Fragile?
I said -
We're going... Let's run through the plan!!
Yeah... That was my bad, sorry.
You bet your fucking ass it was!
Yeah,  <b>Shut your fucking face, Unclefucka!!</b>
Oh.
You can't do this!! Have you ever HAD Cheesy Poofs? They're a taste sensation with a delightful cheddar crunch.
What?
No you guys... Something happened... You guys wanna hear something creepy?  I don't think Kenny is dead.
YOU DO?!
WAGAGAHGHGH!! YOU GUYS!!! SERIOUSLY!!!
No you can't Kenny!
Okay.    Not.
I bet him he couldn't set himself on fire and now he's all pissed off!!  AGH! I can't say pissed off?!  AGH!!
Mkay, you see, children. This is exactly what I'm talking about. We have to change the way you think.
God Damn it your mom is a bitch, Kyle.
The rest of you are graduated. You can go home today.
Oh that's easy, you just gotta find the clitoris.
No, what does that mean, find the clitoris?
Doky maping she deeder!!!
Mph rm. Rmph rm rmph rm.
Oh, you want out of hell, huh?
Aw, ma!!
We already know what you did. We saw it on television.
Uhh... I'm here for La Resistance.
Yeah, I guess.
For pooping, silly.
Kyle, check it out.
Where do they come up with this stuff?!
Aw, God Damn it, he's singing that fucking song again.
She's not my girlfriend, dude!
How do we do that?
Dude!  It's the V-chip!  It shocks him ever time he cusses!
Wait! Before we put a message out, do a search on the word 'clitoris'.
No, dude, all you have to do is hit the keys really fast and say a bunch of stupid shit and it works.
Yeah, so what do we say?
Yeah, but you know, I learned something today.  I learned that getting all worked up over fuck and shit and cockmaster is just stupid... You all focused so hard on erasing profanity that you forgot the most important thing... To love each other.
Wake up, people!  We all have to do things that aren't pretty sometimes! It's the not pretty things that make life worth fighting the not pretty things for! Why do you think children have to be born in hospitals?
Huh?
Yes?
Oh.
No, it was worse than that...
What is Terrance and Phillip?
<b>SHUT YOUR FUCKING FACE!! UNCLEFUCKA!!! YOU'RE the one that fucked your Uncle, UNCLEFUCKA!!! You don't eat, or sleep or mow the lawn You just fuck your Uncle all day long!</b>
Hello, Brooke Shields!
Cheers, Terrance!
Canada is saving us!!
Okay, kid, I have a deal for you! If you want out of hell, all you have to do is collect 10 proofs of purchases from 'Snacky Smores.'  They're rich, chocolatey and really hit the spot. Bring me ten proofs of purchases and we'll grant you ANY WISH YOU WANT.
Can we talk about this later?  Everyone is watching!
Listen guy, you're embarassing me in front of my friends!  You know how I get mad when I get embarassed.
That's nice, Stan.
God damn it, why does she keep saying that?
Bedrock!  I cannot dig any further in zis direction!
Dude, you didn't say anything about watches.
Anna...
Anna Koros. She sensually extends her hand, Warren shakes it -
Well I guess we're neighbors for this trip.
It certainly is.
I'm sure I will.
You didn't do anything to the monitors, did you Mac?
They are awaiting further information.
Well it's a good thing that I did.
Why yes Ryan, I am, and thanks for asking.  You don't have to talk to the intercom, I can hear you fine.
You better start making sense!
Sure you do.  Sending Mac out on a little recon work.  How pathetic.  Problem is it seems Mac blew a few fuses.  Or maybe he's just a little drunk. Were you partying with a robot Taylor?
Good help is hard to find...
Not me.  I'm in for the long haul. In nine months I'll have enough to take a few years off.
I don't have a problem with it. Besides, you get to meet a lot of interesting people.
Suppose you didn't have to hold your breath?
Yeah, let's hope he can find a way through.
Even if we do, it might be too late.
Why?  Where are you going?
I'm going to try and buy you some time.  I can get to the bridge from here.
I can't!
Try not to think about it.
I don't know.  Wave to them!
Is there anything I can help you with?
There's no time to explain.  Get everyone together!  We found a way to the pods!
He's up on the bridge!  He's going to be OK.  Now who's missing?
Look you were the one who wanted to do something different, something to tell all your friends.  Any chump can go to Nassau.
Talk to him...Jesus...
Well what would you know about it? You don't have anything to lose.
Certainly.  Anything I can do to be of service.
I would recommend a maintenance crew in this sector.
My father used to say to me "Never..." no, hmmm. "Always..." No, no...  Ah! Love and hate are blood relations.
Can I get you something for the road?
Look Sid, a Buzz Burger. The Faz's favorite lunch. Sid reaches for the plate. Buzz walks over to the booth  and pulls his burger away from Sid.
I should've pegged you guys for bowling dicks from day one.
So Buzz, let's skedaddle. Mr. Kastle is waiting. As Buzz gets up, Theo rises and steps between his father and the two sleazeballs.
gambling. And it was a safe place for kids, a place where the whole community could meet for some wholesome, clean fun.
Kastle's daughter's been lookin' for you.
Nectar of the bowling gods, Faz.
I've never had orange whips, I'm from Akron.
Grace Skinner.
Maybe I could bowl in Japan.
I don't need the stinking pro-tour.
Bowling died for me years ago. Besides, I'm a living dead legend. I'm a hero.
I never saw you.
Millie, please.  I don't have a son. I think you better leave now young man. Buzz gestures towards the front door.
You see what you did?  Take your ball and get out.
Cool!
It feels good to let it out, doesn't it? Sheila leans over and whispers furiously to her father.
Who's there?
Who's there?
Blueface! Blueface is my favorite.
If Junior thinks you're doing the bouncy- bouncy with his sister, he's gonna tap dance on your spleen. 
That's right, didn't you have a slight control problem in a recent tournament,champ?  Now go take out your "big four", darling.  Come on, we're making her nervous.
He's earned an early retirement.  But enough about losers; Buzz Fazeli is history. Lets talk about your future.  I wanna show you something.
He stuck it in the ball return machine when he was a kid. Crushed all the nerve endings. Junior starts stroking the ketchup bottle with his dead hand.
That's why Mom ran away, because you had to control everything!
Hello, Violet. How's my favorite 'bowlerina' doing?
No, no, that's too far. Try a more gentle stroke. It's all in the stroke. Go ahead, now, honey - stroke. As the camera comes around the side of the whale, we see an elderly man in a fire hydrant red sports coat and white slacks hunched over a diminutive fiftyish woman.  His back is to the camera and he is wearing a baseball cap with a plastic halo attached to it.
I'm sorry about Zeus, Millie.
I couldn't kill Buzz. I need his help. Theo helps Millie load suitcases into the trunk of her car.
How do you want it?  The eggs.
I'm not here to - I can't...
He follows me, he tries to have sex with me, and then they send him to the nut-hut for a while and then he gets out and then he follows me, he tries to have sex with me, they send him to the nut-hut for a while...
No, not at all.
So, what about you?
Plan B is your dad.
He said he'd sponsor me.
Sheila, please.
Really? I kinda like it.
I bet you get to meet a lot of eligible bowlers.
More than you could afford.
If you want a professional man, you have to be willing to pay for him.
...lane six. Yes.
Why should I help that old fuck.
Way too late. Buzz Fazeli is history.  Too late for what?
He's my father.
You don't have to do this. We could just cut out of here, go to Akron,  or anywhere else.
I told him you were my boyfriend.
I did your dirty work for you Sheila, now fuck off. Theo drives away leaving Sheila standing alone. She watches his car recede with a thoughtful expression, then turns on her heel.
When I'm with you Sheila, I don't even think about bowling. Theo takes Sheila in his arms and kisses her passionately. She stops him and looks around nervously.
What about plan C?
Your word is so good, you're never gonna give it to anyone.
I'm not dumping you, I'm suspending you.
The body was identified along proper Bowling Congress guidelines for processing a bowling related fatality.
Please, Dr. Levine.
It's burning...
Yeasts?  Thank you, Beth, but I don't think we're gonna open it up and find a loaf of bread.
Edmunds, do you have a 20 on Norman?
Two and a half days?
You're a fucking biochemist, aren't you?  Can't you tell us something.
What if it attacks?
Do it, Norman, it's the only choice we have.  This thing is gonna crush us.
Now!
Nothing else.
Press?  No, I haven't.
It doesn't make any sense.
What's wrong with oxygen?
I don't know.  But it's something alien.
What do you mean, he's missing?
I think I do.
The message doesn't show a lack of intelligence.  It's smart.  It's approaching us in a simple way.  Like you would a dog.  Holding out your hand, letting it sniff, get used to you.
I think we should be careful. Consider his emotional response.
... it raises a very serious question: <u>What happens if Jerry</u> <u>gets mad</u>?
Yes, I do.  Whatever's out there, I think is his response to us refusing to talk to him earlier.
Jerry?
Send them, damn it!  I know, but I'm not gonna be held responsible --
If the subs aren't here yet, sir --
Chipped?  The door?  How can it be chipped?
Yes, Harry.
Let's say whoever made this thing is a thousand years ahead of us, just like we are to, say, medieval Europe.  Suppose you went back to medieval Europe with a TV set.  There wouldn't be any place to plug it in.
We're all very proud of you, Harry, but what the hell is it?
How do you mean, strange?
Duly noted, Ted.  Edmunds, try using suction.
Radiation shield, you think?
What would we be working on in the future that would make us want to come back?
Captain, I personally feel we should ask much more substantive questions --
Too big?
What sub?
C'mon, Beth -- that report's like the blind leading the blind.
Underwater?
The timing has never seemed quite right.
No.  Go ahead.  Really.  Ladies first.
Good theory, Ted.
Disrupt our brain waves, interfere with our ability to think.
The library.
Normally, I'd say no.  Everything's quiet now -- no ships, no divers, no electricity.  Makes sense.  But what's curious is -- these aren't normal jellyfish.
Beth --
Beth.
C'mon, Beth.  Don't make this personal.  He told me himself they were taking us back.
Where did you get this?
It's done, alright?  It's over!  And there's not a damn thing we can do about it now, okay?
What?
It's also our only way out of here! It holds three people.  And there's only three of us left now.
In case you die, too?
I can't see anything.  How does it look?  Still clear?
What are you doing in the ship?  Beth?
The refridgerator.
But how?
Why would Harry go back to using a code?
Something for burns.
Tarazine?
How do you spell it?
Beth --
You want to kill him?
You think I'd really drink that?
You tell me.
You think I manifested the snakes?
C'mon -- what?
Am I?  Or am I making so much sense that you're going insane?
You don't remember you did.  But I'm sure you remember running like some fucking hero to get Harry, don't you?  You remember that.
Is it?
Promise what, Norman?  Tell me!
It's not safe for you to be either.
C'mon --
Yes.  And I think we already know it will.
It's an American spacecraft.
Cannibalism, to be extreme.  And now we're talking about a new life form. Their values and ethics may be incomprehensible.
That's a hell of a mistake to make, Beth.
Yeah, I don't know how you could make that confusion.
Like what?  I'm not --
I'm not being defensive.
No, why don't --
Wait a second, I --
Whatever I can do to help.
Good point.  I don't know what you're talking about, but good point.
Meaning we're never gonna get the chance to tell anyone.
You mean, you think I'm cracking?
What noise?
Her suit's gone.
Stop what?  What are you -- ?
You got her?
I'm trying.  There.
Nine hundred feet to surface.
We all kill ourselves?  Bad joke.  Sorry, Beth.
You mean forget?
But it's impossible.
Gimme a minute here... I think I've got it.
Please.  It must have flown here --
Does this mean what I think it means?
What was that, sir?
No, they didn't say --
He's a pussy.
You're a 53 year old shrink, what are you gonna do?
Sure, why not.  Give him the trophy. That pretentious son of a bitch.  You heard him, Norman.  All that "someone went to a lot of trouble, try again" bullshit.  And "impotent".  Where does he get off saying I'm impotent?  He's a fucking self-righteous, little prick.
I'm not sure.
Four.  Four years --
I'm Ben Kenobi.  Luke Starkiller here is leading our expedition.
You might get your stuff together. We'll be coming up on Organa Major soon.
Their bases are very well hidden. All the power of the Empire can't find them... Do you know where they are?
This isn't a game, you know.
There is a greater risk in staying here, you know.  If you don't find the princess, then the whole trip was for nothing... wasn't it?
I know that.
You could put it that way.
I know your intentions.  I probably know much more about you than you realize.  In many ways you're a lot like your father.  He was an indulgent man, but a clever warrior.  Now what brings you out here?
But you must!  I can't do it alone. I'm not at all like my father.  I'd never make it.
My father used to talk about the Force of Others.  But he never told me what it was...
Could I learn to feel it?
But you're still a powerful Jedi. You don't need my help.
Five, maybe.  Let me handle it.
Keep away, I'm fine, I'm fine.
You look great!  The uniform and everything!
Yes, sir.  I was considered one of the best bush pilots on Sullust. I've also had six hours on the T-2.
Yes, your highness. I'll let you open it then.  It won't be too long before they figure out what happened to us.  This has turned into a brilliant escape!
I have little time for your mercenary concerns, but I am grateful for the service you have given to our cause.  What is your price?
It's automatic.
You're good with 'remotes,' but how are you against something living?
They must be shielded somehow.  I'm sure the base is there.
But you promised!  I've saved enough money and now you have the extra help ... you promised!
Can you stand?  We've got to get out of here before those Tuskens come back.
No, you're not.  What kind of talk is that...
Sir, I have a couple of extra circuits.  Perhaps they might bring something.
I read you sir.
Are you there, sir?  We're going...
Oh, yeah ? I don't see anyone else here with the chops to lead.
We're the old men, Ace.
Got it. Fleet tactical wants to know where they can deploy the skimmers.
Sir... I guess I do, sir.
Sorry, son. I can't do it. You signed the 1240/A. It would be illegal.
What's the hurry ?
You got it bad.
Bugs laid a trap, didn't they ?
Everyone is going to the dance. Aren't you ?
I'm the guy who's gonna teach you to fly this crate.
You weren't thinking...you were dreaming !
So who's got time to get married ?
Excuse me...!
A funeral.
Excuse me...!
Don't be so sure. I like you even if you are dumb with numbers.
It's not you, Johnny. Your parents are rich they don't need to be citizens, and that stuff means a lot to my dad. He's a veteran.
Sometimes I do what I want, eh ?
I can't help it.
Who cares ! The Federation'll give me everything I need for the next two years, right ?
I try just to be happy I'm still alive.
That was just a mix up.
I like it. It's kinda...you.
Thank you, ma'am.
Actually, Diz, I promised Carmen...
Sure.
You are. I joined up to get out on my own. And you had to tag along.
You take the stroll down Washout Lane, you're only proving one thing, Johnny.
I'm gonna need a squad leader.
What ?
All bands.
No, you're gonna be alright, Diz !
Who gave you this idea ? It's that teacher. What's his name ? You know the one I mean.
Teenagers !
I won't quit !
My job is to protect the lives of my soldiers so they can kill bugs, Major, and if you're walking me into a trap-
Are you kidding ? They always get killed. You want the job ?
He was a teacher , kind of a know it all... Always had this little smile.
Courage, I guess.
You heard me. Wanna make something out of it, private ?
Been better, buddy.
Landing zone is extremely hostile. Come down on this transmission !
Uh, I don't know.
Figuring things out for yourself is the only freedom anyone really has. Use that freedom. Make your own choice, Rico.
Yes, sir...
Yes, sir !
V'ger travels to the third planet to find the Creator.
The Creator has not answered.
The information will not be disclosed.
<U>Answer</U>!
That is logical. You may procede.
Spock...!  Get a fix on his position!
Mr. Scott... on my next signal.
-- You, personally, are assuming command?
Permission to speak freely, sir?
Mr Decker....
How do you define <U>unwarranted</U>, <U>mister</U>?!
Forcefields, full remaining strength...! Total reserve!
It's a programmed <U>mechanism</U>, Mr. Spock...
It seems we <U>all</U> imagine God in our own image.
You got the Enterprise, it's what <U>you</U> wanted. This is what I want.  But, Jim...  ... <U>I'm</U> the right choice for this mission.
Decker....!
I would never take advantage of a sexually immature species.  You can assure him that's true, can't you?
Wormhole distortion has over- loaded main power systems...!
No more than I expected  Not as difficult as this. I'm sorry...
Welcome aboard, Lieutenant.
My oath of celibacy is on record Captain. May I assume my duties?
Impact in fifteen seconds...
Aye, sir.
That was the order, Mr. Sulu: Clear the bridge.
Intruder scans emanate from the exact cloud center. Energy of a type entirely un- known to me.
Instruments fluctuating, Captain. Patterns unrecognizable.
Transmit image of the Alien to Starfleet; advise we are attempting further communication.
Delay that order, Scotty...! Disengage all main drive systems!
I am seeking answers, Captain.
A life form of its own; a conscious, living entity.
The point... 
... and then to reassemble itself <U>combined</U> with the Creator. The most certain way of obtaining all the Creator's answers.
To you, sir?
Aye, we understand that sir! We're doing our best.
We're ready, sir.
Sure plan to.
Local Drama Group.  Northern Books.  No, it hasn't come in yet.  As soon as it does.  Yup, you too Marge.
Everybody makes their own fun.  F'you don't make it yourself, it ain't fun, it's entertainment.
I need a typewritter.
Why don't you buy it, only forty bucks.
First organized fire department was on the border of Dalmatia and Sardinia in the year 642.
Yes...
Goodbye.
Everyday things...yes.
I live there.
Mmm.
Yes...
Well, first, you got to change the title...
Wait wait wait wait wait he gets a second chance, do you see?  And <u>you</u> get a second chance!
He doesn't go back to the <u>mill</u>, he gets a second chance to go back to the <u>firehouse</u>...
...oh...oh.  Well.  That's very important.
I thought you had Play Practice.
They're all preparing for the auditions - your movie.
What?
"Room Service!"
You have to sign for it.
I don't drink.
You going to ask me in?
The other side.
You believe that?
I hurt you?
No.  You, I told them, you can't betray with the picture what you're saying with the words.  And, I don't know, the movies, I don't know.  They should be socially uplifting, why does she have to show her br...what is this...?
Oh yeah.
Yes...
...well, we do that <u>anyway</u>...
...the better to eat me with, your dear?
Maybe they'll be <u>other</u> movies.
...I'm sure that people are upset...
What I am <u>saying</u>, is, we have to Look Out For Our Own...Now:  they want to close down Main Street...
Where have you been...
Wai...It's so serious you couldn't call to tell me you'd be...what...?  What did you say...?
Who is this person that you've found?
No.  Don't tell me that.
Why, you <u>whore</u>!
We'll work it out...
Hi.
It's what you give to your secretary instead of a raise.
They know what her tits look like.
Whatever it is.  GO <u>do</u> it.  How you doing on the permit?
You told me that about the <u>last</u> town.
What, what, what, what do they got that can pass for the Old Mill...
...you got to get me that street for nothing...
Waterford, Vermont.  Where is it?  <u>That's</u> where it is...
That Could Be.
I <u>know</u> my lines...
No, I was, I was, I was just <u>learning</u> on, it's a...
Bourbon and Milk.
...not if you've got something to hold on to.
I swear that that woman in my room...
Page...<u>three</u>.  Now:  "It's a nice evening."  I'm not gonna say that... "It's a nice..."
He's saying, what are you saying, Bobby?
Tell it with <u>pictures</u>.
You can go...
I just don't know what <u>order</u> they come in...
Of course he...
It's night.
I wasn't in the car.
He's on the Island, he'll be back on...
I really think that <u>business</u>...matters should be discussed between you t...
Cool it, Babe, you started this...
I, actually yes.
Why?
Yes, but, Joe, <u>Joe's</u> been, well, he's just been having a few, uh, "Thoughts," about...
I can't do it, Walt.
Everybody, they, they, they treat me like a...
...they treat me like a <u>child</u>.  I, I...to bare my <u>body</u>.
We, we have to give it.
I...
...she has a <u>home</u>...
I'm sorry Walt -- it's gone beyond that.
Marty...
Bob Barrenger...Bob...Bob Barrenger's in this movie?
I can't tell.
Who got their heads cut?
Nope.  I'm just supposed to hold people's hands, while they die.  What'd you say your problem was...
Mornin, Chessy...how's the back...?
I want you to hear this, pal...  Forget the overages, <u>forget</u> Ten Thousand Dollars for three days to two weeks.  You know what it would cost for them to <u>build</u> this set?  Two Million Dollars!  Now:
I want to talk to him.  Would you ex...
I'd prefer it if you didn't speak to me.
Eight hundred thousand dollars in cash.
How about that.
Sure.
Wait a sec, Marty.  Call us back.  Two minutes.
"Suspicions of arson, these fires, believed set by a disturbed Teenager, were, in fact, the inspiration for the formation of..."
Get Mitch Cohn on the phone in New York, tell him she's breaking her contract and we're very up...
I can't find the writer.
I was in New Hampshire.  I was at the Old Location.
You built an Old Mill in New Hampshire...
Well, you know, you know, that's a lie, I, I...
I know you do.
Where have you been...?
So be it.
I really don't think you should be talking this way to a lady.
I...
I can write it.  I can't type it.
I...?  I saw it.  I was there.
...the house, the 1835.  The original <u>kitchen</u>, of course, burned in 1960, as part of a spate of fires...
My undies, cause, you can't get this picture off on time I'm gonna' wet myself.
55 days and I take home the camera. I got an idea for a <u>product</u> placement...
Like dykes and dogs.
<u>Pay</u> her.
No no no no no no no no no find me the money...
She wants eight hundred thousand dollars to show her tits.
"Bazoomer <u>dot</u> com."
Is that one hell of a kid?
Would you, tell the guy, get the A.D., someone, somewhere where we can <u>get</u> <u>away</u>, something, I want, you know, last day before the shooting, get away, forget it, have some local food.  You want...

Only second chance we git, z'ta make the same mistake twice...
Wally, I got to takes out that window from the dog.  I can't shoot through...
I'll ride ahead.  Nelson, protect the Queen...
During sex.
But you only wore mascara when you and Daddy went on romantic dates...
Or blush.  You look pale.
Like how?
Like a big sister.
You lied.  If you lied <u>then</u>, maybe you're lying <u>now</u>.  I can <u>never</u> belive you <u>again</u>!
Great.
...they all yell 'There goes the Virgin Queen' or the 'Ice Princess', or some <u>really</u> clever cut like that. Like it hurts my feelings.
Oh, yeh.
Maybe twenty.
You cannot <u>believe</u> what he said, it was the worst <u>instant</u> of my total life on <u>Earth</u>!!
Thank God for that!
See, I...
That's so weak.
You think this is funny?
Suits me <u>fine</u>!
IT'S NOT YOUR <u>FAULT</u>!!
Not use my words, please!
Uh.  He thinks his nose is too big.  But it's not.
He'll be impressed.  The clincher is, you <u>walk</u> away, then <u>whip</u> around...
But Rache...
There's worse things.
No.
Hello?...Duncan...The Ad Agency's already there?...I'm out the door...  Ben!  Knock it off!  It's gonna go beautifully...  Damn it Ben --
Annabelle let's get something clear.
Aren't you going to drink your cocoa? It's the good kind.
People like Rachel who only think about themselves often do make a lot of money.
Yes...if you like big hair...
Yes.
Nope.  I got my warm t-shirt.
You have the WORST flu since...
I'm still sick, but I'm better.
That's Rache's song!
Rache can do that part.
Rache says it's from you.
So where are you?
I once threw an entire bowl of jello on my stepmother's head --
Every day.  More and more.
Sooner than later.  You really need to.
No, no, no, this is a job that's hard to <u>keep</u>, <u>not</u> a job that's hard to <u>lose</u>, can't be both.
Except for last Thursday when Rachel forgot to pick them up --
I'm worried.
Luke, I need to switch next Friday for Thursday, so why don't you take the weekend...  ...that way you'll be there, and I'll pick up Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
I'm not gonna wait around to see the next one.  I'm not gonna watch my kids fall through the cracks of this arrangement.  I'm seeing a lawyer.
<u>Slugs</u>.  Have faster learning curves. <u>Trees</u>, even.
No.  You think this is going to help the kids then you do it.  You're on your own.
Stop.  You're making me insecure.
Yeh, better I should forcefeed him burnt lamb and...couscous, was it she made him?  Boy, kids go wild for that.
We're going to win this.
What is this?  The Betty Ford Center?
Maybe you could back off just a little bit --
No.  I thought it might be uncomfortable for her --
You listen carefully because I am only going to say this once.  That woman has nothing more to do with my children.
I'm sorry.  Look, I'm not real comfortable being here, but...
Why not just bring the whole toilet?
Hey.  At least it's not an editing machine.
Let's...hold up for a bit.  It may not happen.  Our secret, okay?
See, I know that.
Ironic, huh?
You're a cross-dresser.
Right.  Which is the whole <u>point</u> of this 'going out' thing, so one of them can dump the other one, and they can imitate the whole passionate adult soap opera tragedy, without ever having to actually date.
Beats me.  Ask your mom.
It's a mess, right now.  That's my project when I get back.
It's promising, this one.  We're upbeat.
Is that what he told you?
Are we.
Don't be too sure.
Right down to the ground.  Let's get to it.
Aw.
And she'll fight back again.  God help me, what have I done.
Neutral ground.  What's up?
Don't flatter yourself.  I always liked that line.
No, there isn't.
Is scary.  But you want it.  Gimme some truth here.
You're the hip and fresh.
I have their past.
Just sit me up.  Nice and tall. Bring Benjamin first.
Yeh, it's cheaper.
For what?
Can't handle them myself is what you mean.  Can't.
No you don't.  And I'm not gonna screw with my kids heads right now --
I think so...What do you think?
I know that.
Hold your applause.  We're not having fun, here.
You took a fishing trip with the boys. Liked it so much, you took another.
Let me put it this way.  Hell, no.
By way of saying you were unhappy.
Excuse me.  'Things are so confusing for me, Jack.  Our life feels too comfortable, too safe, too predict- able.  It's a partnership, it's juggling schedules.  When I think of playing that out, every day, for the rest of my life...'
No, here's ugly.  'I love <u>you</u>, babe. It's just our <u>life</u> together I'm not so sure about...'
That's not us.
I'm gonna get me a drink.
What?
Conan O'Brien? Whoa! What are you doing here?
Great to be here.
Be your sidekick, you know, and maybe eventually become a TV talk- show host.
No.
No, Mikey.
Mi Jesusmi jesus
Poison gas.
Jesus was not bad.
It is when you love someone, and they don't love you. And then you do something about it.
You're showing how superior you are to your subject. TOBY No, but I like my subject. I like these people.
Yes, I knowBut still, it should be somewhat entertaining.
No, no, no. No exploitation. This is seriousBut don't you find it a little funny too, at the same time?
Look, we're not suckers. Everyone else is out there doing the same thing.
How was the class?
Fine.
Huh?
You know he hated my story also.
'Cause Scooby does have a quality that I've been looking for, a quality that is emblematic of American today. It's part disillusionment, part hope...
I'm going in there.
Thanks.
Sure, Dad.
Uh huh.
Good.  'Cause I...um...I really agreed with everything you had to say last week about how bad my story was...
No.
Thanks.
Again!!
'OK.' So you just don't care.  Let me ask you, not as your guidance counselor, but...as a friend: what do you want to do with your life? I mean, what kind of long-term goals can you possibly have?
C'mon. Talk to me. Tell me what you're thinking.
Ah-hah. And how is it you hope to achieve this goal?
Oh, fine. How are you?
Great!
Yeah, well, then it got me writing, so that was a good thing.
I worked over at a homeless shelter for a while, drove a cab to pay the rent, but, I mean, that was like - I mean, I have some dignity.
Oh, I don't remember that...
Well, but it was so long ago. We were so different back then...
Hunh.
Yeah...um...so anyway, tell me. What about you? I'd heard through the grapevine you were producing movies.
Oh. Tired of 'life in the fast lane'?
Yeah.
Thanks.
Uh, yeah, we're getting there.
I dunno. I'd like to be good at something. It doesn't have to be TV. I mean, it could be movies...Anything. I'd be willing to direct.
I now understand the expression "you get what you pay for!" A bunch of chumps!
Well get someone down there!
I'm not arguing.  I'm just telling you what the deal is--Congresswoman.
Yeah?...
What happened?
What are you talking about?
Even better.
Are you going to kill us?
We've prohibited the networks from broadcasting the transmissions.
I'm sure you'll figure it out.
What the hell is it, anyhow?
I know what I'm here for-you don't need to remind me.
You're fucking crazy Richter--you know that?
Gotcha.  We've been filling barrels all day--we've got  hell of a stockpile.
I say we head out.
Are you hungry?  We can discuss some final arrangements over some slop in the galley.
Dissent?
How much of this shit do they have, White!!
All right, Mister Ambassador!  But you must treat General "Buck" Schmuck with the respect due him.
It is very convenient to place all the blame on a dead man.
See!  See, I told you.
Didn't they tell you?
Sure...sure, Colonel.  Now look, I'm picking up the phone...nice and slow.  Right?...Hello? ...Hello?  Hello?...Hello?...Gee, it must be edad. Probably the lines were hit during the fighting.
Well, I'm General Ripper's Executive officer. He'll want to talk to me.
What did you say, sir?
Well, that's the funny part of it, too, sir.  It doesn't show a damned thing.
To be perfectly honest, Mister President, we really aren't sure.
That's a very wise deduction, General.
Well...I suppose penetrate the base by force.
That certainly would be a problem, sir.
No, sir.
Yes, sir.  What's up, General Ripper?
But...what kind of a shooting war?  Have they hit any of our cities yet?
Yes, sir.
I understand, sir.  Nothing comes or goes without your personal say-so.
Thank you, sir.
Well, sir, I was thinking, if an enemy attack is in progress, how come the radio's still playing music?  It's supposed to go off, and all we should hear are Civil Defense broadcasts.
Well, I was thinking, maybe an enemy attack is not in progress?
Ask away, Major.
If we haven't taken any further action, they certainly will.  Doyyourhappen to remember the statistics on our casualties in the event of a full-scale enemy attack?
You're being dense, Major.  I certainly don't
Not yet, Major.  Not yet.
But war doesn't make sense precisely because the weapons can kill an entire country -- right?
I was just going to say, as long as the weapons exist, sooner or later something's going to happen -- and that'll be it for both countries.
Gee, sir, that last remark doesn't exactly make all the sense in the world.
No, sir.  I'm sure we wouldn't.
Yes, sir.  Why don't you stop the fighting, sir?
And I suppose there's some reason why you haven't recalled them?
Knock it off will you, General?  Crudley, find out what's holding up that call!
They're coming in now.
General Faceman, what was the name of the officer who called me from Burpelson?
Well, just common sense, sir.  Thirty from thirty-four equals four, or my name's not "Buck" Schmuck!
Well, sir, it looks like one aircraft, the "Leper Colony", failed to receive the recall.
Zlat, make sure the secret service boys care- fully search his seven body orifices.
No, they wouldn't send us in with bombs on an exercise.
Roger. One-three-eight.
The dirty, stinking, rotten, sons of B's!! They might have clobbered Marge and the
Main interference linked to electronic detector.  Fight interference on readi- ness state.
Zombies set to knock out local air defense four hundred miles from primary.
Speed?
Come on, Quentin, isn't that pretty selfish, putting yourself ahead of the mission?
Lieutenant Quiffer, we're all sorry you were hit, and we'll help you stick it together as soon as we get squared away.
I think they mean business.
Hey, Terry, I'm hit.
Ready, Major.
Damn you, Lieutenant Toejam!  Lothar!
Some kind of signaling.
Very interesting.
Forget it.
Skip it and jump, damn you!  This flak's so close, I can smell it.
Our targets are a missile complex and an airfield - not cities, right?
Well, if they hit us first, they've probably fired off their missiles and got their planes off the ground already.  We'll just be hitting empty real estate.
Hellnno, Major.  I was just trying to think the thing through.
Check, ten thousand air burst.
He's dead.
Quentin, how's your gear?
What do you mean?
What are you talking about?
Why should they call us back?
I don't get you, King.
Look, King, maybe you've lost too much blood, or something.
Well, I hate to say this, but I think the bomb bay doors are stuck.
Let me check.
No. Oh, maybe. Fuck.
Why is everything about you, Jeff?
Tim, he listens to you. Do you think it's a good idea? Seriously?
Hey, you said you did a video?
A cloud?
Oh.
What?
He's around and, you know, maybe he's coming by. Sooze told him to come by and hang out, whatever. It's no big deal. Me, him, and Sooze are gonna...
Yes!
Same, more of the same. Yep, just keep doing the same thing all the time, around and around the clock. With an occasional burger or slice of thrown in for our vitamins and energy. Then, instead of watching Gilligan, we'd watch Captain Kirk.
So, we're all old friends of Pony's. We go way back to our childhood.
So you can do an album cover?
No, no.
No.
Uh, Buff, I'm, I'm, gonna tell you something and, uh, you got, you got, you gotta promise not to tell anyone, alright?
Uh, last night...
No.
What, they're looking for her?
Buff...
She's dead.
No, no, no.
Alright. 'Bye, Buff.
I'm just gonna go. I figure the worst I can do is starve to death.
You're fascist, man. Neofascist.
So, how was the ride, kids?
Yeah.
Sure I am. It's fun.
Yup. Hey, um, so, um, listen, man, I got to go show the tape to Danny at the hotel, and if I get the gig, Erica is gonna teach me how to surf in L.A.
I will.
You owe me twenty cents. Come on, seven-twenty. Seven-twenty.
This is private property, my friend.
Yeah, we're just screwing around. Like Mohammed said. Can't take a joke, man? Hey, I hope you got a permit for that, mama!
Glad it's okay.
Oh, you were there?
"Closed, closed, closed." But with your music.
I could.
Yeah.
Oh, man. Wow. I was never into football, you know?
Hi.
He is?
What about me? I don't have a car.
Military marching bands.
You cut off your little finger?
It's a mistake to think that.
Oh, Erica, this is my friend Jeff.
Two-fifty? They go up?
He causes problems. He was here earlier.
Hey, he's a human being you can give him that much.
Because I'm alienated.
Okay, great. Well, now he's crying. Are you guys happy?
No, no. I'm not, I'm not talking about this. I did a bad thing, Jeff.
I hit her.
Wow. You did that for me?
Well, you know, all I can say is, you're a fucking fool.
Oh, shit.
Will you just put the gun down?
Hey, Ma, look at me! Top of the world, Ma!
Is that Bee-Bee?
Look, your trespassing.
I don't know.
Look, why do you care, huh?
I'm not doing it anywhere, Jeff. It's just part of my application to the School of Visual Arts in New York.
Mister Brooks has had shows in New York, Jeff. He's been reviewed in Art Forum. I think he knows.
Hey!
Oh, yeah, right. Yeah, right. Fuck you.
You know, all you know is what's good for you.
Typical male.
I would've stopped it.
Us.
Okay, look. My job is not who I am. I don't need that. Why? What's your goal? Status? Money? Getting your picture on the cover of some glossy magazine?
No, no.
Jeff likes to argue for the sake of arguing.
Yes, you do.
No. No, no, no.
But wait! Sooze, I don't wanna fight. I'm so sorry.
No, I mean it. No, look, when, when I got out of the car I walked all the way here.
No, maybe not though. That, that's what I'm trying to say.
What?
Wow, man. The corner. I mean, nothing's changed.
We sold, uh, over ninety thousand units and uh... and Danny says that we're gonna get a gold record. Yeah.
Hey, I though you guys were coming to the show, man?
Look, man, it... Shit. Why don't we get something to eat? I mean food?
Oh, no, no. Uh, uh, George, pull over.
Yeah, yeah. That's the fucking problem.
You know what? Go ahead and shoot me. Go ahead! Fucking shoot me! Come on! Come on, man! Come on!
Look at you!
Yeah.
I do. Jeff, don't you think Sooze should go to New York and, uh, you know.
I don't want you to do the cover, I, I need you to do the cover.
Yeah, we'd have to fly you out for meetings, you know.
I can't believe you're still here.
I don't know. I say what I mean.
Or the future, oh, no, no, I mean... I mean, we'll be working on that album cover, right?
Really? What else does your mother say?
Whatever.
Don't do that.
... my manager will slap an assault charge on your ass faster than you can say AA, okay?
Yeah.
Uh, eleven twenty-five.
Why don't you fucking relax? He's having verbal intercourse, Sooze.
You piece-a-shit bug zapper!
You have three heart attacks and a half dozen strokes and tell me how much you wanna run up and down the stairs.  Shit - I forgot to pick up the cigarettes.
I just pulled and it - it came off.
Look, it's really not my fault.
Oh for Chrissakes...  "White trash Betty."  I didn't realize the rules went into effect before we entered Safeway.
Everything's fine.  I'm just having a little trouble keeping my frown upside down.
Bye.
Huh-ha-wha?  Ahh!  I'm under the ice!  I'm uh -- oh...man...  That was a weird one.
"Positive" you're sure I'm not fat or "positive" I'm...
If you don't - can you still afford to go to Harvard?
So then this isn't crazy.  It's a sure bet.
Of course - of course!  Hands in...
Spit from your dad?
Jack...
But we agreed your job is running the baby machine...
I'll just ask the question myself... "Is Jack Bartlett interested in me?"
He is the Great One...
Oh - okay, we ain't done with this... Those babies are gonna get a good start in life - with a real crib - one that costs a shit-load!  We're gonna learn how to rob a bank from the only people who really know how to do it - criminals!  I'm gonna visit my mom!
Ooops, that's me -- gotta run!
Don't Martha-fucking-Stewart me!  If you don't like it - you try being a pregnant teen!
It wasn't like the prison we saw - all these women had to shave their heads because they got lice from the filthy lives they'd lived!  Oh G-d, I'm gonna be someone's bald bitch!
Kansas?
Oh yeah, you caught us...
Maybe we can make a deal.
Wait a minute.  You watched the Apple fucking-Dumpling Gang?!
Am I the only one who cares about this? At least I watched "Dog Day Afternoon!"
Bank branch!
My what?
Now how the hell can I help you?
Well, shit-fire, Kansas, that's the sweetest goddamn thing ever...
I'm terribly sorry, Mr. de Mille.
Let it ride for a while.
Where's the bar?
The greatest.  They call me the Elsa Maxwell of the assistant directors.  Hey, easy on the punch bowl.  Budget only calls for three drinks per extra. Fake the rest.
I mean, could you put me up for a couple of weeks?
Don't worry.  She's just a fan for my literary output.
What's wrong with it?
I'm sure you'll be glad to meet Mr. Gillis.  He wrote it.
I just think pictures should say a little something.
Dark Windows.  How did you like it?
Maybe that's why it's good. It's true, it's moving.  Now why don't you use that character...
You'll be waiting for me?
I haven't been keeping myself at all.  Not lately.
Is that so? What's the wonderful news?
You did?
I tell you this is half sold.
Sorry if I crossed you up.
See if they make sense.  To begin with, I think you should throw out all that psychological stuff -- exploring a killer's sick mind.
Now I see her teaching day classes while he teaches night school.  The first time they meet ...
I'll make it short.
I think so.  They're on location in Arizona, shooting a Western. I'm free every evening, every week- end.  If you want, we could work at your place.
Came  on back.  Let me show you where it fits in.
I gave her some advice on an idiotic script.
That's the trouble with you readers.  You know all the plots. Now suppose you proof-read page ten while the water boils.
What were you -- a child actress?
It must be my new shampoo.
Was I?  I'm sorry.
No, no! I haven't heard any of this.  I never got those telephone calls.  I've never been in this house ... Get your things together. Let's get out of here.
If you love me, Joe.
Hello, Mr. deMille.
You'd better.  I'm very angry.
You know, crazy things happen in this business.  I hope you haven't lost your sense of humor ...
It's a good script, isn't it?
I don't care about the money. I just want to work again.  You don't know what it means to know that you want me.
That's where the popcorn business comes in.  You buy yourself a bag and plug up your ears.
Yeah?
I think that's what it says on my driver's license.
It certainly could use a pair of shears and a blue pencil.
December twenty-first.
Thank you.
I wouldn't worry about money. I'll make it worth your while.
Unpack nothing.  I didn't say I was staying.
Honestly, it's a little old hat. They don't want that any more.
Can't you wait till I'm dummy?
I've lost my car.

Just follow me.
Why not? What I'm trying to say is that I'm all wrong for you. You want a Valentino -- somebody with polo ponies -- a big shot --
What kind of a silly thing was that to do?
Not until you promise to act like a sensible human being.
This is the right day.
DeMille is Leo.  I'm Scorpio. Mars has been transmitting Jupiter for weeks.  Today is the day of greatest conjuction. Now turn around.  Let me dry you.
Where are your...?
I don't think so.  It's your script.  It's your show. Good luck.
He was trying to spare your feelings. The studio wanted to rent your car.
Thanks.  How did you know I was going to stay, this afternoon?
Good.
I wouldn't look too closely at the postmarks.
It was I who asked to come back, humiliating as it may seem.  I could have gone on witn my career, only I found everything unendur- able arter she divorced me.  You see, I was her rirst husband.
What car?
Bases Loaded.  There's a 4O-page outline.
Frankly, no.
Goodbye, Mr. Sheldrake.
Greatest thing that could happen to you.  Now you'll have to sit behind that typewriter.  Now you'll have to write.
Did you hate him?  Had you ever thought of doing something like this before?
Now, now do you belive me? I told you deMille would jump at it.
All right.  Camera!  Action!
How can you create beauty...with a selfish heart? The spiky insect-creature flies closer and closer around the little girl's head, buzzing angrily. Her look of delight turns to fear. She tries to shoo the creature away. It flies off toward the thin membrane that encloses the city.
The danger. The one Nigel spoke of. It must be near .
Softball.
Sorry, mistress.
I'm taking you to the hospital.
Later.
Who didn't?
You love me?
Are you sure it's all right for us to be here?
I'll be safe with you. We can stay together the rest of our lives.
Just give me a chance to show how much I love you. Love changes everything. Love makes everything possib1e.
No.
Just like that?
I sort of like what you said.
And now...the guitars are out of tune, and the words don't make sense, and somebody unplugged the mike...
You'll be safe here. I'll come back as soon as I have the Power Source.
Hmmm?
I did.
And you think you're in love.
This "love" of yours will soon wear off. I gave you a temporary love potion.
I don't know. You seem afraid.
Theories?
-- Planet. I mean, you were there. Do you think it was natural, or like some people are claiming, supernatural?
Did anybody notice you?
Lucy! Be serious. We could be executed for  treason!
Why haven't you been able to contact him? He should have returned from the neutron galaxy ages ago. He may be dead. ZOR-EL But what can you, a mere girl-
As brave as my father. As wise.
It's something they have on Earth. You know, where your cousin went.
Oh wow, I should've known. Me and my big mouth. Listen, you can borrow any of my clothes you want. Any time.
I dunno, but he's gonna get creamed.
Somebody's gotta do something!!
Mr. Danvers called. I'll get a new one with the insurance money. B.F.D.
Oh, yes. Knocking. The pre-entry signal. I forgot.
A cheap trick.
Not yet.
Criminals.
Told you. Wouldn't listen to me. Knew it would make you sad.
Of course, my dear. What can I do?
If there's a way in, there must be a way out.
No, it's no good---you can't practice--- you only get one go. A thing like that. No. Sure you don't want a sip of this? It's delicious, I think.
You could do anything. You could sculpt mountain ranges...draw with rainbows! You'd have superpowers.
Don't stop. Keep moving.
First the supplier couldn't find the invoice. Then the order came up short. Then I missed the four o'clock plane from Cleveland and had to rent a car, and then I got a darn flat tire on the highway! Can you beat it? Boy, your boss must've been furious when I didn't show up by the end of the day today, huh?
What? What did you tell me?
Hey! Y'know what they used to call me in high school?
Nope.  Never. 
Uh, no, I didn't know that, Brad.
Clark.
You always did.  Can I give you a hand with that?
I didn't --
You thought that?
Hey, he'll be all right. Believe me Lana, I know. I was a late bloomer myself.
I'm talking about salt.  Oh, go ahead, pour it on, relax. That's what picnics are for.
I meant all the choices here. All this --  -- cole slaw, guacamole --  This is some picnic!
Call me.
What!
We get together sometimes.
Say!
Exactly what I was about to ask about me.
I wouldn't know Mr. Kent. Most of the people I went to high school with are still in high school.
What's that?
At one o'clock in the morning?
Gus Gorman.
Yeah.
Thirty-five.
First paycheck?
What'm I gonna do with half a cent? Buy me a thoroughbred cockroach?  Everybody loses them fractions?
So where is all them half-centses?
Yeah? What do you do with 'em?
Or socks.
Plants. Plants always make an office cozier.
Decaffeinated too?
Destroy the entire Colombian coffee crop down to the last bean.
God, that's what I keep you for.
KRYPTONITE!
Don't be getting' racist with me, man.
You designed it?
What will it do?
What will it get me?
Ain't nobody gonna mess with my machine! I'll...I'll... what will I do?  I'll build in a counter-punch! Anything attacks it gets counter- attacked! And wiped out!
Join the party, genius! Come on up!
I was afraid you'd say that.  Hey, is there a bus station around here?
Sister! I'm his sister!
Oh Bubba, think of the possibilities.
A story like this cries out for great human interest pictures.  The big dance! The Homecoming Game! Mr. Kent posing next to his old locker!
We've already met.
No, I don't think I would. So... then what can I do for you?
And he use to be such a sweetie pie! What's wrong with him the last two weeks?
Turn on the light.
In other words, push this red button.
But how? Where's it getting the power from ???!
You've got to pick three more numbers.
Somehow your twisted little mind should be able to figure out how to tap into the main computer at the Aerospace Center and reach Vulcan.
A normal person.
We can get to work on that oil!
Not quite. What is that in the lower right hand corner?
She'll be fine.
Then maybe you should get your glasses checked.
Of course not. Not when you've got so much going for you.
Really?
That's because you can hardly see through those things.
Lois, you're amazing.
Don't fake me out, Clark.  Or whoever you are.
Listen, I've got to give you credit. Your disguise is nearly perfect. I mean, if you fooled me, and I am nobody's fool --
Oh come on, that's ridic -
I guess it would be all right if -  Lois, now that you know me, I think you ought to know it all.
Do you . . . ah . . . want to step outside?
I don't want a bodyguard. I want the man I fell in love with.
I'm sorry.
Does she know about it? She's in it!
I wouldn't know. I've never had one.
I'll be alright.
Wrong.
What'd he say before? He saw a girl?
Give it another ten minutes. If we don't --  Hell, I'll tell him.  Pete? If we haven't got anything new in the next ten minutes just go with the wire service copy under the 40 pt. banner and run the picture for three columns.  Kent,	I need a background story for the page 3 sidebar. Give me every thing you know about this terrorist group.
Superman's got something up his sleeve, that's for sure. We just haven't figured it out. Isn't that right, Miss Lane?
Yes, but it's not all I feel.
Now This I want to hear.
I want my Liberace record back tonight.
I mean they can't even trace that guy on that radar they got, every time they try he just flies off.
North.
That little black box, Mr. Luthor, I mean -- what's it for?
Me? I'm loaded with good! I mean I've never even used it.
Wait a minute, wait a minute, let's talk a deal, Superman. We can take a lunch on this --
Um. . . .we have made this guarantee.
Brave young heroes. Be nice to them, my dear. Blow them a kiss.
Yes?
And I'm usually in bed by ten-thirty.
Gosh, I'm sorry, we better get in line.
What about here?
Yes, I know. I'm sure it will be a great story.
Come early. The view is so romantic from my balcony.
Clark. . . !
No mind, it's only antique Irish linen.
I'm sorry to see you go.
Clark, it's Lois. This is the fourth message. I've left. . . Where are you ?
You haven't been at work . . . you didn't call the office . . .  you didn't even call me. How could you not call back?
And this so-called . . . Nuclear Man. . . of yours can defeat Superman?
Daddy . . . ?
. . . And  very nave!
An angle?
Who?
Why, Lois, I didn't know . . . Who is he?
Something . . . wonderful.
But why the hair?
Let's try to keep your I.Q. a family secret, Leonard. Before we launch him against Superman, we have to test him ... see how well he does with mayhem and destruction. Kind of a coming out party under the glare of media covering the Metro Club gala. And once he proves himself, then . . .
Get the box, nephew.
Didn't you see it? He lifted me up and crashed me down.
Good. Let's hope he stays that way.
Never. But we have to hide out for a  while. Lay low. Say. . . a couple of years. By then I'll have a new plan.
I made you, and I can destroy you.
Destiny.
Know something? You're a workaholic. A good guy 24 hours a day. Stop and smell the roses sometime. Take up a hobby. Get a pet . . . a kitten or a puppy. . .
You've broken all the laws of man, Luthor. And now you've broken the laws of nature! . . .  I assume you must have hidden a device in one of the missiles I hurled into the sun!
No, no, listen. I escaped with only one thing on my mind . . . the end of Superman.
We're running out of smoke.
And stop interrupting. his is the big scene.  Your finest hour! You rose to the challenge, baby! And you lost. That's the best part!
One of them should've been you.
Lois isn't here?
What's she doing in California?
Anyway, we Kent's don't like showoffs, ain't that so? A body's got to be humble even if he knows that he's better'n his neighbors.
I know son, I know...
Hey, you're getting a better class of people in your office these days, Boss.
Not really, no.
But otherwise it's swell.
Oh.
You were probably so scared you didn't look to see what the trick was.
I don't know, Lois, but I do know a fraud when I hear one. This thing goes against all natural laws.
You too.  I just...I can't get it on for good guys. Y'know?
Help! I mean  --  I can't stop saying it. Silly, isn't it  -  There's nothing to worry about. Help! See.
Screaming
My father always said to me, 'Son, don't invest your money in anything but land. Land! Stocks rise and fall, banks fall, people are no damn good, but they'll always need land and for that they'll pay through the nose. 'Remember that ,' my father said. 'Land."
Criers and complainers! That's what I get! Moaners and groaners! Me, Lex Luthor, who figured out how to live in luxury without ever paying one cent in taxes. Lex Luthor, who built this fantastic kingdom under the sea, so to speak, hidden and undetected by the fools who eke out their miserable lives on the streets above.
You'll be seeing stars in a minute, Miss Teschmacher. y'know?
Fifty degrees below and still falling.
I read the article.
But if I put my leg out like Claudette Clobert in  --
A night on the town instead of under it?
Yours not to reason why, Miss Teschmacher. Relax! Enjoy it!  Just look at that smog!
Lex is going bye-bye.
Of course I can. I love you.
You are one of Krypton's greatest scientists Jor-El -
'And the people on the street, the little man who runs the corner newsstand, the old lady sunning herself on the stoop the kids playing stick ball -- none of them will ever forget the night of senseless bloodletting that turned a friendly block part into a nightmare.' 
What's your name, boy?
He will be odd, different.
It does, huh?  Clark Kent, I'd like you to meet Lois Lane.
Let's just say I'm a friend.  And watch yourself from now on with those things, Okay?  I mean if the good lord wanted people to fly he would have given them wings.
I'd appreciate it if you didn't smoke.
Ask, You're the girl reporter.
Thirty-five.
Pink.
Well, I was born on a planet your scientists don't know too much about. It's in the Xeno Galaxy. Or it was. It was called Krypton. That's K-R-Y-P...
Not there!  A pine tree in Death Valley? Idiot! This is for the North Woods section!
I...uh...check.
Otis...
It's a Twinkie, boss.
And Zoe?  How's Zoe?
Are you still in touch?
Which one?
Which clinic?
Other clinics?  Oh sure.  Clinics, half-way houses, treatment centers, detox units...
She didn't.
It turns to steaming piss.
Alison.
Nicole, I'm just going to pack all this stuff and give it to the church for charity.  Don't feel bad. Unless you feel strange about wearing it.
And she really liked you.  She would've given you all this if she'd outgrown it, or...
Why not?
I'll help pay for Nicole, if that's what you're really talking about. I'll even give you the money I got for my kids.  That's what we used to do, remember? Help each other.  This was a community.
Billy, that's too early.
Something made this happen, Billy. Mr. Stephens is going to find out what it was.
Risa, I serviced that bus.  At the garage.  There's nothing wrong with it.
Why?
Yes.
For rabbits?
From what?
Berry-picking.
Did his parents attend to that?
Did they give him special care?
What other people?
Who's been talking to you about what I'm feeling?  Who should care about what I'm feeling?
Yes.  Abbot understands these things.
Oh, it's bizarre alright.  C'mon Bear.  Let's get you out of here.
How long has Dolores been driving that bus, Mr. Otto?  How many times has she steered clear of danger? What went wrong that morning?
Yes.  It's a present.
That's what he said.
Don't you usually like to sit at the back?  To wave at your Dad?
Well, if he knew magic - if he could get the kids into the mountain - why couldn't he use his pipe to make the people pay him for getting rid of the rats?
The people in the town?
Yes.  Dolores...and even your mom and dad.  But I'll make sure you go last.
So you can keep on getting well before you have to go and do this. It's not going to be easy, Nicole. Do you understand that?
Was the bus on time?
People who will help our cause.
Wanda and Hartley.  They lost Bear. He was their adopted son.  A beautiful boy.  Indian.
That's good.  Judges like adopted Indian boys.  Tell me more about the Ottos.
What do they do?
Sure, it you could find a towel in this bag.  I know my wife packed one in there...
Perfect.
Daddy?
No.  But this is.  They wouldn't take my blood.
Yes.
You don't believe me?  You don't fucking believe me?
I'm afraid this meat is overdone.
Who are you?
Mrs.  Otto,  there is no such thing as an accident.  The word doesn't mean anything to me.  As far as I'm concerned, somebody somewhere made a decision to cut a corner.  Some corrupt agency or corporation accounted the cost variance between a ten-cent bolt and a million dollar out-of-court settlement.  They decided to sacrifice a few lives for the difference.  That's what's done, Mrs. Otto.  I've seen it happen so many times before.
No.
Don't know.  Food banks, welfare, church charity.  They scrape by.
There was a brown dog that ran across the road up there, right by the dump, and Dolores slowed down not to hit him, and he ran into the woods.  And then Dolores drove on and turned onto the Marlowe road, as usual.  I remember that.  I'm remembering it pretty clearly.
Before the actual accident?
Yes, I understand.
Seventy-two miles an hour.
No.
You mean it?
Sure.  I'll fix it right away.
My lawyer?  Why do I need a lawyer?
What about insurance?  Doesn't insurance pay for these things?
No.
It's too late for that.  She can't drive the bus anymore.  The school board saw to that right off.
You don't know that.
Is "he" inside?
Just hopping tonight.  Leo Bartha been in?
We're on our way there now...
I doubt that it matters any more.
Call him up and ask - he might drop dead with shock.
Otis was outraged when I told him Van Cleve was going to fire you. Tell him not to pay any attention to anything you-know-who says about you-know-what.  Right, Otis?
No, I wouldn't...
Nuts!  I'm not here as an artist! I'm here as an average Joe, who happens to love your sister Susie!
No punch line.  Maybe I was just admiring your know-how---yours and Falco's.
Those "dears" sound like daggers. May I suggest that you stop DARING her to speak?
I'm trying to get Susie to stand up to you.  But your manner is so threatening that she's afraid to speak!
No, I don't care about you -- you're fantastic.  My whole interest, if it's not too late, is in Susie...and how to undo what you've done to her...
Why?  Because I don't like the way you toy with human lives? - Your contempt and malice?  Because I won't be the accomplice of your sick ego - and the way it's crippled Susie...?  You think of yourself - you and your column - you see yourself as a national glory...but to me, and thousands of others like me, you and your slimy scandal, your phony patriotics - to me, Mr. Hunsecker, you are a national disgrace!
Why?
I wouldn't have called the boy exactly balanced...
We're friends, Harvey - we go as far back as when you were a fresh kid Congressman, don't we?
Bonna sera, commendatore.  Come sta?
She mighta jumped.  Love suicide?  Check it for me, Phil...it's a real heart throb.
Are you finished?
What you promised - do it!  Don't finagle around.  It's later than you think.
When?
Don't go wild, Sidney.
J.J., I swear to you on my mother's life, I won't do it.  If you gave me your COLUMN I wouldn't do a thing like that...
I call him the boy with the ice cream face!
- He's got them on him.
Yeah...  And another thing - he's gonna say you 'resisted arrest'...  You know J.J....!
I've been up to here.  Listen, honey, tell me something.  You know Susan Hunsecker...?  Has she been in?  I mean lately, in the last coupla days...?
...cigarette girls... And naturally -
What sort of thing?
Nothing I didn't think of you before.
It won't leave much of a balance in the bank...  Mr. Robard?  Could you locate him?
Take a top coat.
Well, I'll tell you what - excuse me for breathing, will ya?  How do you like it?  He comes to my office and -
Don't you think it's about time you shut yours?  Who are you to tell a man like Frank D'Angelo to shut up?!
Why don't we hear what Susie has to say?
I wasn't looking for a brawl.  I came to bring him a present.  Wanna bite to eat?
Not to me.  Sometimes, the world feels like a cage.  Then someone comes along and opens the door...and it's never Monday night again...  I wish you and Steve could like each other.
Chickie, I'll have to laugh at that - an attractive girl like you...!
Why should he put on an act?  Your brother has told PRESIDENTS where to go and what to do!
I could almost forgive you if what you did to Steve came from jealousy and love...
Yeah.  A coincidence you should run into the very man you've been ducking all week!  This is my press agent, Joan.
Why did you call me?
I know.  You told me.  It's a neural-net processor.  It thinks and learns like we do. It's superconducting at room temperature. Other computer are pocket calculators by comparison.  But why is that so goddamn important, Miles? I really need to know, 'cause I feel like I'm going crazy here, sometimes.
Shut up!  SHUT UP!!  Motherfucker!  It's all your fault!  IT'S YOUR FAULT!!
In the bathroom.  Danny, can you get them for us?
You are targeted for termination.  The T-1000 will not stop until it complete its mission. Ever.
Of course.  I'm a terminator.
A hundred and twenty years on my existing power cell.
Yeah.  I guess so.  My mom says when I'm, like, 45, I think, I send him back through time to 1984.  But right now he hasn't even been born yet.  Man, is messes with your head.  Where's that other bolt?  Thanks.  Mom and him were only together for one night, but she still loves him, I guess.  I see her crying sometimes.  She denies it totally, of course.  Like she says she got something in her eye.
You mean people?  I don't know.  We just cry. You know.  When it hurts.
Uh-unh, no, it's different... It's when there's nothing wrong with you but you hurt anyway.  You get it?
No problemo.
I don't care!! There's gotta be another way. Haven't you learned anything?!  Haven't you figured out why you can't kill people?
Remember what I said, you can't...
Actually, no, she's a complete psycho.  That's why she's up at Pescedero.  She tries to blow up a computer factory, but she got shot and arrested.
No!  Don't kill him!
But it's the only proof we have to the future... about the war and all that.
Look, Mom, if I'm supposed to ever be this great leader, you should start listening to my leadership ideas once in a while.  'Cause if you won't, nobody else will.
I couldn't... oh, God.  You... came here... to stop me?
SHOOT!!!!
Oh.  Yeah.  They... make me take this stuff...
Don't quit, Sarah.  Our son need you.
I see.  Let's go back to what you were saying about these terminator machines.  Now you think they don't exist?
There's 215 bones in the human body, motherfucker. That's one.  Now don't move!
Doesn't want you thinking too much, huh?
Then what?
I don't know.
Respect your elders and your betters!
Eating is eating... and...
I'm Steve. What's your name?
Sounds a lot of run.  So they sent the big guns to check up on me. We recruiting children now?
You call me sir again and I'll make you listen to Beethoven.
was born here, in Leipzig. I escaped in '36. My parents, they sent me to my uncle in Philadelphia. They were to follow. But they delayed and...
Major, this is deeply offensive and repugnant!
Your manner.
With more what? More what?
What is it with you, David? Where are your feelings? Where's your hatred, your disgust? Where's your fucking outrage, David?
Not yet.
Furtwngler's in a different category.
There are good Party members who help, and there are dirty non-Party members who inform on you. Of course, they gave him privileges.
What museum?
My father was one of the officers in the plot against Hitler. They arrested the plotters and their families.
But... he only wrote nine, Major.
No. Ours was damaged.
Shut the door, Emmi. Sit down, Emmi. We're going to keep him waiting, too.
What's not right?
I received a telegram from Hermann Goering informing me that he had made me a Privy Councillor. I was not given the opportunity either to accept or refuse. After the dreadful events of November 1938, the violent attacks on the Jews, I stopped using the title.
I don't think Dr. Goebbels sent me a telegram. I was simply told. In a letter, I believe. I don't remember exactly.
That... that was a different matter, I... I was tricked.
Then why is it, please, that another conductor who was actually a member of the Party, who used to play the Horst Wessel before his concerts, has already been cleared and is working again while I have to wait and wait and wait?
I believe it was because of another letter I'd written to Goebbels lamenting the decline of musical standards due to racial policies.
During an enforced hour-long interval because of a power failure at a concert here in Berlin, Albert Speer, the Minister of Armaments, said to me, 'You look very tired Dr. Furtwngler, you should go abroad for a while.' I knew exactly what he meant.
I've had enough of this, I'm leaving.
I wasn't told. I just knew it.
I was warned.
Don't talk to me like I was a second violinist. Go back into the waiting room. Miss Straube will come and get you when I am ready to see you.
Gee, that's a thing of beauty, honest to God, a real thing of beauty. I'm going to try to remember that. Liberty, humanity and justice. Beautiful. But you used the word 'naive'. Are you now saying you think you were wrong? That art and politics can't be separated?
And when did you first learn that - when you sent the telegram? Was that the surrender signal, the waving of the white flag?
'Happy birthday, dear Adolf, love Wilhelm.' Or words to that effect. That sounds to me like you were dropping on your knees and saying, 'Okay, Adolf, you win. You're the number one man. Have a swell party.'
The birthday greetings you sent to your old pal, Adolf Hider.
You know something? You should've written our insurance policies for us because you got more exclusion clauses than Double Indemnity. What do you imagine people thought? The Berlin Philharmonic's taken over by Doctor Goebbels and his Propaganda Ministry but Wilhelm is a freelance, so art and politics are now entirely separate? Is that what you believed ordinary people thought?
Yes, von der Null.
How long's this going to go on, Wilhelm? I say von der Null, you say von der Null, I say von der Null, you say von der Null, we could go on all day. You know who von der Null is, don't you? Edwin von der Nuell, music critic.
And what did he say?
I'll tell you why. You remember we talked about you playing for Hitler's birthday?  And you told me that Goebbels got to your doctors first, that you were tricked?
But you see what I'm getting at? You get a gorgeous house, you're highly paid. What are you gonna do, stay or leave? One voice comes back at me: stay!
I don't understand what you mean.
Speaking to Party members I used their language, of course I did, everyone did.
That's what I asked.
You seem to understand the question, now how about answering it?
So. You wanted to see me.
One-zero-four-nine-three-three- one. Or d'you mind if I just call you 'one'?
Yeah?
He did?
His private life?
Yes, Dr. Furtwngler was absolutely clear about this: politics and art must be kept separate.
Like this bandleader.
Absolutely not.
Then how do you explain him being made a Prussian Privy Councillor?
Brave?  To celebrate Hitler's birthday with some heroic piece by Wagner but without the Nazi salute? Bravo.
Not really.  Do you think you can get here on time if I put you on the floor as a waitress?
It's not brain surgery, Chuck.
I thought you did.
That's none of your business.
What's it to ya?
One possible future.  Four your point of view.  I don't know the tech stuff.
White light.  Pain.  Like being ripped inside out... slowly.  Like being born, maybe.
It was an honor.  A chance to meet the legend.  Sarah Connor.  Who taught her son to fight...organize, prepare. From when he was a kid.  When you were in hiding, before the war.
Okay.  Talk some more.
About where you're from.
What's that?
Why?
Molecular-memory.
I'm wrong here.  I wasn't meant to see this...
Later.  I'm going out for materiel.  Keep this.
Nitroglycerin, basically. Bit more stable.  I learned howto make it when I was a kid.
I want it to be over for you.
No.  I'm not.
Someone?
Pain can be controlled. You disconnect it.
You're not supposed to.
SKYNET.  A computer defense system built for SAC-NORAD by Cyber Dynamics.  A modified Series 4800.
Okay.  Okay.  But this...  cyborg...if it's metal...
Most official records were lost in the war.  The computer knew almost nothing about Connor's mother.  Her name. Where she lived, just the city. No scanner pictures.  The Terminator was just being systematic.
I'm afraid that's not up to me.
Who is in authority here?
That can't be right.  That's the name of the one Valley Division mopped up this after- noon.
I know.
I just called.
I can hear it now, it's gonna be the goddamned 'Phone Book Killer'.
There is no Baer/Grant Publishing without Alan Baer.
"Whereas once I was blind, now I can see."  Night, Nick.  Best of luck.
Then, you kiss his ass.
What are you talking about?
I don't understand why they're getting you involved.
How do you know that's the way?
Never mind.
You pull me up.
Me?  You're the one who... !  Shit!
... two hundred dollars a toe.
That tall, bright building.  Near there.
Right.  Call me Christy.
Let me go get some clothes on. We'll talk, okay?  Be right back.
Get out of my car!
I don't know, nobody does.  I'm an employee.
What are you talking about... ?
Overseas operator?  Please dial Allgemeine Bank, Zurich.
I'm back from the dead.
Nicholas...
That's not true...
No...
Like... where are you from?
Underwear?
"Seymour Butts."  I never get tired of that one.
They'll be wanting it back.
Fun?
They're methodical.  They're nothing if they're not that.
You think I know?  I paid them <u>more</u> to make it stop.
It's a flat tire.  That's all.
No.  Do you?  Can't be too hard, can it?  I don't think we should be here out in the open like this.
Stop this.  It's not true...
Of course, Nick...
I hope.
I'll call.  I really will.
A game?
I'm tired of dealing with peons.  I need to get to whoever's in charge.
Shut up.  Cuff him to the rail.
I told you, they hired me over the phone.  I never met anyone.
Like, this way... sort of...
No, you didn't...
Have a nice day.
Okay.  I think he's into some sort of new personal improvement cult.
He came to my mind recently, that's all.
You're here for Conrad Van Orton? I'm the hotel manager...
It's a private matter, for you... I think you'll be more comfortable...
His behavior... ?
Look, where is he?!
Nothing.  Nothing at all.
That you've involved Conrad... is unforgivable.  I am now your enemy.
You know you can.
Attempted murder.
It's not Victorian, everyone thinks that the whole nineteenth century was Victorian.  This is gothic, this is English Craftsman, this is Romanesque.  This is... insane.  Who lives here?
Well, I... uh...
Is this true?  I've been hypnotized?
Yeah.
Sure.
There's a carriage house around back.
You could have.
Will the two of you shut up!  God damn it!  Maybe the tests were right, Marrow.  She's sensitive, she's vulnerable, but I don't think she's suicidal and I didn't have to test her.  Maybe she wasn't trying to kill herself. Maybe she was really scared. Maybe she really heard voices.
Mary, I'll meet you outside.
She needed a job, Malcolm.  And she's smart.  And she helps me.
This is the last chapter.  Please, please give me clearance.  It's for science.
I'm really... honored to be part of this study, Jim.
I don't know.
You'll never see it again.  Mr. Dudley's taking care of it.  I'm sorry, Nell.  Can I show you something you'd like to see?
There were no children.  Rene died, and <u>then</u> Hugh Crain built all of this, and then he died. His heart was broken.
It's okay... we're all here...
I'll take her with me to the University tomorrow.  I can't believe I read the test wrong.  I didn't see anything that looked like she was suicidal.
No.  If he's lost somewhere in the house... he'll have to stay lost until tomorrow, until the night is over.  What we have to do now is be together, with Nell.
I'm a scientist.  I just conducted an experiment.  Now I have to write it up.
Mrs. Dudley'll be waiting for you.
Who?
Fifteen dollars.
I don't know what you mean.
A blank canvas!  I could paint your portrait, directly on you. Or maybe not.  So, you?  Husbands? Boyfriends?  Girlfriends?  Where do you live?
I guess.  Oh, your hair!  It looks good.
Two sets.  I don't know.  Maybe they're not even his.
What's his first name?
Maybe you did it yourself.
I'm trying.  Have you ever kept something to yourself because you were afraid it'd ruin things.
Then let's go get you one.
I'm loyal to things that make me happy.
Like you.
We all did.
Okay.
What shit is this.  I just do it.  I don't prepare it.
What the papers used to call a "gangland slaying."
Why, because you're my security consultant?  This cocksucker nearly burnt my house down.
And where is this guest?  Don't they want to interview him.
We'll find him.
I wouldn't talk.
I saw your mother on the Strip last night.  She went up to three guys, said she'd like 'em to stick one in each, know what I mean?
England.  Only, we saw there was a show on, thought I might pick something up for a price, type of thing.
Just luck, this, really.  Never been to one of these before.
Terry Valentine.
I only asked.
Who'd Jenny get it off of -- this grass or whatever?
Well, there you are.  Jen must've liked him.
Hang about.  I thought you said he come into the restaurant where you worked with Jenny.
Extra muscle.  Bodyguards.
See what I mean?  Wearing bloomin' uniforms n' all.
Yeah, I suppose.  Call 'em that, yeah. Down the boozer Saturday night.  Meet some of the lads.
Probably.
Really.
No, but I know what he means.
I'd rather be with him than without him. I don't want to be found dead in L.A.
You look alike.
Wanted to talk to you, didn't I?
Sewing mailbags?  Me?  Never did an honest day's work in my life, dear. Wasn't about to start when I was in stir -- not with all that leisure time on my hands.
Hardly buried.  Earning interest, love. Earning interest in an offshore account. Tidy little premium per annum, that.
Sarcastic, moi?  Maybe I'll mellow when my ship comes in.  It's expected any day now.  I'm all packed and ready to go.
Three seasons.  They found that's the limit of human tolerance when it comes to following the adventures of a family of Mormons on the Chisum Trail.  I was wife number three -- the ingenue.
No, I had -- some other matters to attend to, you know.  Getting a car sorted ...
Well, I reckoned, Saturday night, if you were goin' out, you'd probably have to come home first.
Yeah, saw Eddie, yeah.  Me and him are muckers.
Well, I gathered something from the article what Eddie sent me.  Some sort of pop music producer, wasn't it.
My employer.
What do you think.
I'll bloody well ask him.
She told you all about my details but not about his.  Lovely.
I'll tell ya something:  it made me a model prisoner.  Put me right off any escape attempts.  Tunnel my way to freedom after that experience?  Not bloody likely.
Get seven years, did you?
Just now?  Overnight?
I've 'ardly ever left it.
What'd your father do?
Still, you could never ... do what she wanted.
Look, mush, you're the guv'nor here, I can see that, I'm on your manor now, right.  So there's no need to get out of your pram.  I'm Johnny-come-lately to all this.  Whatever the bollocks between you and this slag Valentine, it's got nothing to do with me.  I don't wanna know.
Good job your lot showed up when they did or it would've been <u>me</u> for the high jump.
As you prefer, squire.  As you prefer.
My client is an entrepreneur.  I am his lawyer, not his business manager.
Ian?
Yeah.  Cheers, mate.
Where else?
I got half.
Yeah.
Why don't they have TV shows about people whose daily lives you'd be interested in watching.  Y'know.  Like SKINNY LITTLE WEAKLING.  Or BIG FAT GUY.  SICK OLD MAN. FAMILY OF LOSERS.  Wouldn't that be good?
I don't know.
Avery said she was tight with his daughter.
Lemme break.
You bet.
Drugs?  Cash?  Both if we're lucky.
While they're all fucking each other over ... couple of parties like us could move right in.
Looking for a bloke named Valentine. Know him?
I have a message for him.  About Jennifer Wilson.
Listen, get the fuck out of here before you get hurt.  Who the fuck do you think you are, waltzing in here, asking questions?
What are you doing here?
Since when?
No trouble.
-- You know his name is Frank.
That's right, your life is Shit, and I'm to blame.  It's that simple.
<u>Why</u> then.  Why did you do it!
At night, there were lights--we both saw them. We never told anyone, outside of our official report.
The government knows. I cannot repeat it to you. But this thing goes deep, Ed. This was not your wife. I goes deep, and involves the government. There is a great deal of fear. You know how certain circles would find it--the knowledge--a threat. They try to limit it, and--
Sometimes knowledge is a curse, Ed. After this happened, things changed. Big Dave... he never touched me again.
Boy.
...Uh-huh.
Ah... it's nothing.
Uh-huh.
Did she make mistakes?
I don't understand, no mistakes, she's just a kid--I thought you taught the, uh, the--
Uh--
Huh.
Cash.
Sure.
Yeah.
That'll be fine.
Uh-huh.
How's business, Dave?
Awkward?! Ann'd throw me out on my keister! Hell, it's her family's store--*her* store. I serve at the indulgence of the goddamn ownership, Ed.
The sonofabitch. The blackmailer. It's, uh, it's no one you know. It's a businessman from Sacramento. A goddamn pansy, Ed. He tried to rope me into some crackpot scheme; I heard him out and then told him to go to hell. And the very next day, the very next day, Ed, I get blackmailed for the same amount.
I, uh...
Who?
Congratulations, Gina.
Don't tell 'em anything. We're getting you Freddy Riedenschneider.
No. Of course not. She didn't do it.
...OK.
Look, chum, this is a guy, from what I understand, told everybody he was a war hero, right? Island hopping, practically liberated the Pacific all by himself with a knife in one hand and a gun in the other and twenty yards of Jap guts between his teeth.
So... who... who actually--
So--
So, who should I--
Uh-huh. He's the, uh...
I'm OK, Walter, thanks.
Yeah.
Haven't I seen you up in ladies' wear?
Oh, no. That was written by Mr Ludwig van Beethoven.
Yeah.
Now, being a barber is a lot like being a barman or a soda-jerk; there's not much to it once you've learned the basic moves. For the kids there's the Butch, or the Heinie...
Huh?
Yeah--lucky for us, huh, pal?
Come on, Eddie, you're gonna scare the kid.
What the--
Huh? No.
Visiting ends at five. Too late today. You can see her tomorrow.
He said OK. Is that what he said?
Great.
I appreciate that.
You haven't got the authority.  Only Pendergast can pull the plug.
He'll be back.  Relax.  We're in good shape.  Your security is air tight. There've been no more incidents, nothing suspicious.  There's no reason to call off the opening now.
Get his gun and his walkie talkie, Jonathan.  Move.
We've been operating in the red for years.  That was the whole idea behind the Superstition Exhibit.  It was designed to pull people in. We've spent every penny we have on advance publicity, betting everything on the opening's success. If we postpone at the last minute... No.  I don't want to think about that.
To the left twice then five no... sorry... I think it's fifteen... it's been a while...
What doors?
It's a little late, you son of a bitch.  There's a friggin' monster loose in here!  Get the FBI, the fire department.  Find metal cutters, cut through.  And bring a cannon.  The damn thing is huge.
Where's the head?
Can't really focus on birds at the moment, Pendergast.  I'm tryin' to keep my breakfast down.
Apparently it's huge.
Pardon my French, but bull shit.
I don't know.  I thought Dr. Whittlesley died in South America.
I'd say we're in its home.
The thalamus and the hypothalamus, perhaps?
You're right.
Let's not jump to conclusions.  This egg could belong to any number of reptiles, Dr. Frock.
Several problems with that theory. For one thing, this egg is intact. For another, according to Pendergast, the crates were shipped here on a boat.  Everyone on board was killed like Beauregard.  If the thing hatched in mid-ocean, where did it go?
Margo, what you've just described is a killing machine.
Some kind of power failure.  Maybe it's the storm.  Do you have a flashlight?
Don't stop now.
It's one of the fire doors.  Good Lord, Margo.  We're trapped!
We can't.  We've managed to get inside the one place that's safe.  I think we should sit tight and wait for reinforcements.  If we go outside, we're risking more lives. You have to accept it, Margo, there's nothing we can do.  The building must be swarming with police by now.  It won't take long for them to get through the doors.
No, Dr. Frock.  You can't.
Look who's here, Margo.
I wouldn't be so sure.
Read it out loud.
They were sent to the Center For Disease Control in Atlanta.
What is it?
They were green eyes and they were slit like a lizard's.
Heel Argo!  Hobbes!  Heel!
Another storage room.
Frock's been fired.
I'm sorry to be the bearer of bad tidings, but you know me.  Telegraph. Telephone.  Tell Kawakita.  I got the definitive word from Cuthbert's secretary.  This is Dr. Frock's last week.
It's not mammalian, that's for sure. I think it's reptilian.
How about lunch?
An invention of mine.  It's a computer program designed to describe the characteristics of a given species from a reading of its DNA.  I call it the Genetic Sequence Extrapolator.
What happened?
I'm not sure.  We should split up. You take that hall and I'll take this one.
All right.  This is hard for me.  I'm a scientist.  I like order and logic. Sometimes too much.  There's got to be an explanation.  There can't be an animal in there.  But I saw something.
Gone.
It's not supernatural.  Mbwun is an animal.  Part lizard, part human, a genetic freak of some kind, like the half-goat, half-sheep they found last year in the jungles of Vietnam.
Unlock one of the other storage rooms.  We're going upstairs.  We'll leave a trail back to 1012 and try to trap the monster in here.
No.  The planetarium is in the next cell.  This is one of the fire doors...
What are you going to do?
It's scared of me.
Its eyesight is worse than I thought.  It couldn't see us.  And it couldn't smell us through the glass.
I think... for the pleasure of the kill.
Listen to me, Pendergast.  Mbwun's DNA is part homo sapien.  In primates, the eye is a direct path to the brain!  If you get a clean shot, there's only one place you can kill it.  Shoot it in the eye!
I have to shoot.
<i>Fiji.</i>
One.
You are a travel agent, aren't you?  "Doris"?  Your job is to help people travel.
That's right.
He moved down there after Meryl packed up and left.
What have we missed?
Do it!
Thank you.
Let's take another call.  London, England, you're on "Tru Talk."
Truman, I've watched you your whole life. I saw you take your first step, your first word, your first kiss.  I know you better than you know yourself.  You're not going to walk out that door--
It's not gonna be his, you idiot.
I'm sorry.  It's not up to me.
Saturday?
If we don't go now, it won't happen.
You think so?
Sure.  It's halogen.  Shame it didn't hit you - you could've sued.  You coming for a drink?
<i>Mixed up?</i>  Mixed up in what?
Who?
--I figure we could scrape together eight thousand.
Surgery.  The elevator disaster downtown on the news last night.  Cable snapped, a car dropped ten floors.  Non-union contractors.  Monsters.  We're starting with an amputation.
Are you listening to a word I'm saying?
I bet you did.
I'm sure they're just exaggerating.
--What the hell are you talking about?!
Well, I made it through another night.
I've got something to tell you.  You'd better sit down.
I'm telling you, if it wasn't him, it was his twin.  Did Dad have a brother?
Leak at the plant.  They had to shut her down.
You can count on it.
Yeah.
Does what?
You were shot in the head. The bullet broke the flesh on your right brow and glanced off your temporal plate.
When was that?
You called 911. Except the call was intercepted.
Yes.
That the bombing in Dallas may have been to destroy the bodies of those firemen, so their deaths and the reason for them wouldn't have to be explained --
Nothing completely conclusive --
Well...where would you like me to start? Antarctica is a long way from Dallas, Agent Scully. I can't very well submit a report to the Attorney General that alleges the links you've made here. Bees and corn crops do not quite fall under the rubric of domestic terrorism.
The developing organism is using his life energy, digesting bone and tissue. We've just slowed the process.
No. No...we need to try our vaccine on it.
Strughold. He's just gotten on a plane in Tunis.
Into what?
Mulder was in Dallas when we were trying to dispose of evidence. He's gone back there again. Someone has tipped him.
Looking for him for what?
No. I've been watching your career for a good while. Back when you were just a promising young agent -- before that.
I know the name. Why?
Heard you come here now and again. Figured you'd be needing a little drinky tonight.
They want to discredit you -- for what?
You said the firemen and the boy were found in the temporary offices of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Why?
You can't.
I've been using you?!
I think they have that covered.
The element of surprise, Scully. Random acts of unpredictability. If we fail to anticipate the unforeseen or expect the unexpected in a universe of infinite possibilities, we find ourselves at the mercy of anyone or anything that cannot be programmed, categorized or easily referenced...
Panic? Have you ever seen me panic, Scully?
-- Mulder! Get in the car!
All I told them was the truth.
Because they wanted me to invalidate your work, your investigations into the paranormal. But I think this goes deeper than that.
They're not doing this, Mulder.  I left behind a career in medicine because I thought I might make a difference at the FBI. When they recruited me they told me women made up nine percent of the bureau. I felt this was not an impediment, but an opportunity to distinguish myself. But it hasn't turned out that way. And now, if I were to be transferred to Omaha, or Wichita or some field office where I'm sure I could rise, it just doesn't hold the interest for me it once did. Not after what I've seen and done.
Just get dressed. I'll explain on the way.
Mulder --
Mulder -- I can't -- I'm already way past the point of common sense here --
All the equipment is brand new.
That's the first question to answer, if we're going to find them.
I don't know why I think they went right.
They haul gas in tanker trucks, they haul oil in tanker trucks -- they don't haul viruses in tanker trucks.
I don't believe this. I don't fucking believe this.  Y'know, I've been here... I've been here one too many times with you, Mulder.
I have no idea.
Very weird.
Not unless those are giant Jiffy Pop containers out there.
Come on!
We're close to something here -- we're on the verge --
Hang on. I'm going to get you out of here.
General McAddie's.
Thank you.
I breached protocol. I broke contact with the S.A.C. I ignored a primary tactical rule and left him alone with the device.
How deep does this go?
I have answers for you.
I want to know where Scully is.
No. Though I have no way to prove otherwise. The virus is extraterrestrial. We know very little about it, except that it is the original inhabitant of this planet.
That's why you bombed the building. The infected firemen, the boy --
I thought it only fair you should know, given how hard you've worked.
As your father knew, things need to be sacrificed to the future.
Driver.
How?
You need not kill a man to destroy him.
A pocketful of rye...
Almost.  Mocky-Lock showed up.
She thinks I can bring Edward back.
Why not?  Just once.  A trial run.  What harm could it do?
Shush.
If we reverse the feed and bring Edward into your mind, it could be devastating for him.  Imagine the shock of suddenly existing in a whole other world.
And he might blame you for terrifying him.  That one moment could erase all you've accomplished.  And if that happened, the trust he has in you is gone.
Disorientation, nausea, migraines, hallucinations, insomnia, paranoia.
What happened?
I realize that...
You don't know the procedure.
It doesn't have much to do with science.
This is going to sound terrible, but... I don't think she matters anymore.  Not to him.  He never finished her.  The others...he was able to make them his.
If you believe that.
Carl, do you know?  Like on a map...
I can't leave him!
It doesn't matter...
No problem.
Just graduated law school.  Single mom. Had a two-year-old daughter.
Delano?
You're kidding me.
They took care of that, thank you, Henry. 
I'll get her...
That was with Edward.  She's accustomed to his world.  Stargher's mind is unfamiliar territory.  She's "lost."  Someone has to go in. Remind her what's really happening.  And get her out.  Until then, she's at his mercy.
No.
No.
Yes.  But you're going to sit down right now.  I have to...
Damn, man, I give up.  Your partner tells you his wife's gonna have a baby, and all you care about is a coroner's report!
Tell you what.  If this thing burns us, I take that heat.  I give you permission to point your finger at me and say "It was all his idea."
Next time, tell me, okay?
Considering where I've been...
Do you understand German?
That was the man that brought me some money when Harry died. He said Harry had been anxious at the last moment.
He was Harry's driver?
The police. They're searching my room. Sie mussen doch wissen.
Just another part I've got to learn.
In German?
I thought you wanted...
I'm so sorry.
Yes.
Wait here.
Hide? Can't a fellow have a drink?
From Kurtz. They have just been arrested. But Harry won't come, he's not a fool.
They're Harry's.
We loved each other, do you mean that?
I have never seen him.
What can I tell you but that you have got everything upside down.
They'll be returned, miss.
I was a friend of Harry Lime.
Martins.
Yes.
When did you see him last?
No.
Calloway - I'm English, not Irish.
Going to find me the real criminal? It sounds like one of your stories.
Bring him in.
It's more like a mortuary than police headquarters.
Thank you. Excuse me.
I see.
Yes. Where were you when you saw him first?
I'll be your dumb decoy duck.
Two thirty.
I'll do what I can, if she'll let me.
You know, Paine's one of your devoted readers. He's promised...
I'll tell you what, Mr. Martins. On Wednesday night at our institute, we are having a little lecture on the contemporary novel...I thought perhaps you'd like to speak.
Listen, Mr. Martins, if you'd agree to be our guest, we'd be delighted to have you.
No, a major, were you really?
Oh, that is Mr. Martins' little joke, of course...
Very popular. Are you staying long?
Excuse me, have you got tooth...
You can get somebody else...
Don't try to be a policeman, old man.
Tension? KURTZ Suspense.
At the end of every chapter --
What did he say?
Only his doctor, Dr. Winkel.
What's the name of this girl?
The Roumanian?
English?
Who?
Conscious? Cas soll ich auch noch wissen?
Ah, er war gleich tot - I mean, sie war gleich tot - brauchen kein angst zu. Ein moment...Wart ein bissel...Wartein bissel. Fraulein Schmidt!
Yes.
Two double whiskeys. Was wunschen sie?
He didn't want to get involved.
Not necessarily.
Never.
With him.  Fifteen Stiffgasse.
Okay.
Good morning.
We moved rooms because of him.
That's the wrong one.
One or two kilometers.
Why?
So?
So how many miles do you think it is?
We're ok.
It's on an island that no one get to.
Eh - bonsoir.
No.
Where did you lose it?
Uh-huh.
We have free will and intelligence -- which God allegedly gave us....
There's midrash supporting this. My father read a book by Shalom Spiegel that -- Isaac actually died and was reborn.
I do; I follow it. But okay, say God provided the ram. So what? Once Abraham raised the knife, in his heart it was as if he'd killed him. He could never forget that. And neither could Isaac. Look at him: he's traumatized, he's a putz for the rest of his life. By the end he can't tell Jacob from Esau....
They don't have extermination camps.
Are you shitting me?? Right in the store?
Then I won't bring you....
Yeah. He's a respected scholar. Even No-am Chomsky says he --
I don't, but...
At first, no one will know why the victims are being killed.
I work at the Big Boy warehouse. In Queens. I drive a fork-lift.
Killing himself.
Oh, really?
He's at a home out here.
What do you care?
Why not?
I told you, I'm good at this.
It's all you talk about. Jewish, Jewish, Jewish. Nobody talks about it that much except the Jews.
Lina, come here!
Nothing.  Why are you doing this?  I thought God didn't exist.
Who's Eichmann?!!?
He's Jewish? Manzetti?
People hate Jews. Do you agree?
I'd say nothing. After two or three, people will try to find a pattern. A reason.
Isn't that what we want? Germany all over again? Only done right this time...
No... Yeah, fine, go ahead... So what's this about? Is this about me?
Sexuality??? What do you mean?
Everybody likes to, don't they?
Danny, what makes you think you know all this?
Are all Jews the same?
So you're saying it's not true.
It's slander. It's reckless disregard. I'll sue you and your fucking Jew paper.
Yes. Infinitely more. They would become as God.
You're lying.
But I wasn't.
The truth doesn't mean anything to you, does it?
You do it on the inside....
Fine.
Lina, you said if I was going to plant a bomb, I should --
I'm not here to talk about religious law, if you don't like --
They're not my people....
Who told you that?
Her place is down the road. But she just comes out for weekends sometimes.
You could do it.
You look right through him. He's there, but there's something on the other side of him that you want. It's all you want. And whatever's in the way doesn't matter.... Then it's easy.
Green dot -- shotgun powder. For pipe bombs.  A guy in a lumberyard gave it to me. A donation to the cause.
No, it's weird, man. Nobody knows where he went.
Who even knew?
I'm a bad shot. I don't think I can --
Dennis Leary.
Linda says you're not supposed to have dairy.
They're not that Jewish.
What?
Danny, please, we don't want to know.
Eat shit....
As you know, Cindy, thirteen is a mystical number in the Jewish faith. We believe that God has thirteen attributes...
I think anti-semitism today is largely a Jewish phenomenon. Wouldn't you agree?
Curtis is always more complicated than he seems. Even now.
I can't... I just don't know how to...
What kind?
It's the Free Diving World Championship.  I am by the way world champion!
I think I'll have a coffee.
I get it, Enzo you were a superior child.
No.
... That's what he's here for, isn't he?
Okay.
No, it's the recipe for spaghetti "Frutti del mare".  You see I was right in getting you out here.  You're a world champion, my friend!
What are you doing here?
You know what I'm talking about.
The fool was asleep!  If I weren't around, he'd already be dead!!! Is that who you want to live with?
Eh?  Si!  Avanti!
Noireuter.
I didn't say...  Brussels!
It's nothing.  It's just the helium, because of the air pressure.
Hey!  D'you have any other complaints?  Just make a list and we'll stick it on the porthole! Okay?
Yes, of course.  Lots of questions.
What?
As I said, second of all you're too skinny.  You've got tiny lungs. I still don't understand how you can dive without getting sick.
You don't need a stretcher to take her with you.  You know that, don't you?
Yes.
Yeah... Sure... Is this your first trip to Peru?
Thank you.  I wouldn't want to interrupt anything.
Thank you...
Well, water isn't exactly the best thing for pictures... Not even for pictures of dolphins...
No?  Huh?  Yes, of course!!
... The way she moves.
How do you know that?
I'm not from the sea... I don't understand what you're talking about.
It's me... Johana.
... It's hard you know.  You're so far away and I don't know what else to say.
Uh... Ah!  A story?
You'll understand.
Uncle Louis.  He's a 75 year old amazing guy, isn't he?
I'm putting you on the coin... Your essence... That way you'll always be with me when I dive.
You go back, I'll walk.
No, I'll be fine.  Can you just hand me a glass of water?
I saw how it has to be.
That's good... that's wonderful. It's wonderful for you.
The whale!  How could I forget? Always was something fishy about that woman!
Louis, we were French!
You called the police?
What?
Nice... Very interesting... Great!  ... I guess.
Oh Jesus...!  I'll make some coffee.  They left the stove.
Haven't you been listening?
I know, I know!  I'm a terrible person...  It's... I'm so damn, damn sad.
Of course, that's what they're for.
Mayol... Jacques Mayol.
I'll have to talk to the driver.
I got the job done didn't I? I did what I had to do.
What's your first move?
He's...he's very nice.  But Mrs. Carver, the fate of Hanukkah rests solely in his hands. Please, you have to help me.
My name is Esther. Chief Bloomenbergensteinenthal from the Jewish Defense League desperately needs to speak with you.
I said, do you come here often!?
Oh. Okay.
Keep going.
Oh, she said that, did she? What else did Mommy Dearest have to say?
Mordechai!
...I'm not finished yet, mom.
Yeah, I'm going to be out of the office from 1:30 to 3:00 on Sunday. I have a terrible yeast infection and I need to see my gynecologist.
I understand that. I just thought that you might want to know.
Oh. It means that Santa's gonna fuck Hanukkah's shit up.
Okay, look. I'm going to work really, really hard on this one. But, please stop with the pressure. I'm already tense as it is.
He's still working out some identity issues.
Now this might get a bit technical, but try and stay with me. Using a highly sophisticated connection of other computators, called the Internet, I can access surveillance maps, villian biographical information, and even sports scores with a few simple keystrokes of this electronic typewriter.
Oh yeah. Take a look.
I don't have to tell you anything Hammer! You're gonna have to kill me before I tell you!
Resting?
No dipshit, I want you to kill him.
I can't understand that fancy talk.  You mean I'm a gold-digger? Sure, I'm a gold-digger -- why not?
I don't know -
You really think so, Charlie?
I'd like one of them to say it to you, Charlie. I'd like to have you hear his side of it his reasons. Want to hear them?
You found the leopard!
Maybe not - cards mean different things different times --
I want to ask you something.
Sure -- certainly - but what's that got to do with this?
It doesn't know how to hunt its natural prey.
We're old friends.
It could be. Why would a man kill her? For what? It wasn't robbery. It wasn't a crime of jealousy or passion. She had no enemies.
To know where that leopard went -  I'm afraid you'd have to be a leopard and think like a leopard. I was a naturalist. That hardly qualifies me as an expert in hunting down lost leopards. I used to teach zoology in a little freshwater college back East. I gave that up.
I'm sure if you are as talented as you are charming, Miss Walker, you have nothing to worry about.
I thought - is Kiki just going to walk on that floor tonight walk out cold before a bunch of gawks who think a Spanish twirler is the greatest thing in life. No. Not my favorite client. She's going to make an entrance  this town will never forget.
The red dress?  No. My black one. Then I'll be just like him.
The whole town's in a state, Kiki doors locked, people huddling together like scared sheep nobody on the streets at night 
And not a sign of the leopard?
You mean you want to take them to the cemetery.
Aint nobody out there, Mister.
Will you please come with me?
That would be Mrs De Moraes mother, Sir. Mr and Mrs Spitz are here with their daughter.
Perhaps it wasnt so brave of him. Had I been here I just might have given him his money, Mr Lombard. One can reap rewards from the strangest of conduct, as someone in your line of work ought to know.
I dont know. He seems to delight in so much sisterly love, he might become determined.
Disney! How inter...
The question now is whether or not your brother still owns anything, Mrs De Moraes.
Last night you upset my sleep. Tonight my social life. We have two minutes. My dinner guests are waiting.
Paul Lamont...?
Why dont you ask when I left the Mondrian?
You... You are out of order, Mr Lombard. I...
I guess the news youd sent me after Friedman didnt go down too well, eh?
You knew he had nothing to do with your brothers disappearance, didnt you?
I take it you learnt to live with yours then. Take it all the mind-dulling pills in your medicine cabinet are surplus to your well-being...
Leon hung himself.
Leon hung himself...
...You-you spoke to him?
Something like that.
Something like that.
What are you doing? You cant. I...
We? You and your parents killed your husband?
Get to the point, will you...
The dead can wait.
Croissants. Like that...
Im fine standing, thank you.
The Mondrian, room 504. I was checked out in my absence.
Lombard...  It will take a few days for the things I need to get here. Meanwhile Id sooner not draw police attention walking the streets like a hungry dog...
I know where to look.
Burn the passport and keep the money. Think of it as a donation to the cause...
Whos the guy? Whos the guy! Nom de Dieu!  Had the guy got a closer look at you or your number plate Id have had to kill him.
What...  Some kind of organ factory... Pregnant girls doped up. Babies. Theres a lot of people back there. Theyre holding a seminar. Traffickings the past, breeding the future...
So who... Whos the man? Where is he?
Italian? The Mafia...?
What about your friendly cop?
Yeah.
What...?
Where is the Austrian? Is Friedman the Austrian?
Where is he?
No... No...  I swear...
Yeah... The Diplomat.
What kids?
I dont know...  This is just a delivery place, man! I swear I dont know where the kids are... I work for Martin, thats all. Martin knows. He works for Friedman. He knows...
Ill call again.
Can I have the reception desk, please.
La what?
Oh yeah! Better be good and hurry away then! Who knows? We might be being watched! Maybe one of your stupid French companies has got a detective prying into your life - after all, thats what they do to their employees, isnt it? Huh! Hope you enjoy ruining peoples lives. Thanks for the lift!
Jane, there was an envelope in my desk. The one Id given you and then got back, remember? I cant find it. Do you know where it is?
Yes. How did...
May I ask if you are Jewish, Mr Lombard?
I hope its not too significant.
Didnt you say I came recommended?  Thats what I thought. May I know by whom?
My rates...
Why do you think your son chose not to come to you for funds for his photography, Mrs Spitz?
Maybe you should. Think about it. Those who can afford our goods do their thing without upsetting anyone. Those who cant do it to kids from the streets or their own family and it makes upsetting headlines.
Dying without ever reaching the top...
This is the hotel supervisor, Mr Lamont. Im terribly sorry to disturb you but theres been a mix-up with our bookings which you might be able to help us resolve.
Should I come back in five minutes?
Questions can amount to revelations. Now, Id hate to think I was made to come here carrying a substantial amount of money in order to be subjected to a cross- examination. Mr Friedman led me to believe we had a deal. Do we?
Yes. You wouldnt know where I could reach him? We had to discuss an exhibition of his photographs at my Paris gallery, you see? I really need to see him before I leave.
Reach for it and throw it to me. And... My fingers on the trigger, you hear!
Should I be?
Well, I obviously do. And I also know that Leons not here, Rhian. But I thought that you might know where I should look for him.
Did Leon tell you why he didnt want the police involved, Rhian?
Im sorry. Its just you dont look local...
... No.
... No. In fact, Id seen him a couple of months earlier. He was quite depressed. His work wasnt getting anywhere. He said he was going to try something new, realism, London in the nineties - documentary stuff, you know...
Good. You neednt worry about the Austrian anymore. Hes dead. Ill be in touch.
Uh-huh.
Would you know where I might reach her?
Alors quoi?
Figlio di puttana. Youre the French asshole who bumped off the London guys...
Thats just it. The sonofabitch didnt ask for help from his colleagues...  Testa di cazzo! Hiring some amateur outsiders to fix you... He hasnt gone to hell too soon... And neither will you, Mr Lamont!
Thats the beauty. An anonymous call. Makes you wonder how many people know what youre up to, eh, French-fuck?
Dont tempt me. The last scumbag who thought I might kill him died soon afterwards.
Whats that? A word?
Let someone else pretend to be you, and see if...
Majesty, I can't...
Of course I am, it's just that...
This I can do.  I was studying at the University of Paris -- till the English invaded it.
How dare you tell me what God tells me to do!
Jeanne, no...
Yes.  Yes, I'm fine...  We need more brushwood!  Why are you staring at me like that?
So... what am I supposed to do now?
But I hear so many voices... one voice saying one thing, another voice saying the opposite -- love your enemy, kill your enemy -- what is good, what is evil...?
Me?!  It's not me, it's God who makes everything complicated!  If he's all-powerful, why not let the English stay on their island in the first place?  And why let this war go on for a hundred years?  And why send you out to fight when a girl like you should be at home with your family?  Why, why?!
Jeanne... I believe in you... more than anyone...
Jeanne... I have been hearing voices -- and believe me, those voices left me in no doubt that you must not go to Compiegne!
Just give me a moment and then you'll be free...
Yes yes... any moment... you're always so impatient...
I'm fed up with taking her orders. She swore she'd defeat the English before nightfall, instead of which she goes and plays the fool and gets herself nearly killed!  Look at the mess we're in!  That's her mess, not mine...!  We're worse off then if she'd never come at all!  ... now do as I say and Sound the Retreat!
Yes...
And so I... I prefer my banner.
Did you use the sword that you held in your hand?
You held up your sword and flourished it about in the air? Like this?
... so you were in the middle of the battlefield, with your sword in your hand, waving it above your head... charging against the enemy, screaming and yelling... fighting for your life... and you want us to believe that in the middle of all this excitement you never killed anyone?
So long as this bitch remains alive, our armies refuse to fight!  Don't you understand?  They want proof that God is on their side... and the only way they're going to believe that is when they see her being burnt as a witch!
Your king?  Ah yes, of course... What's he going to pay me with? Cows?  Chickens?  I prefer gold, and the English have plenty.  I wonder how much they'll pay... to have the Witch of Orleans in their clutches? Those English are so arrogant, they can't accept the idea of being defeated by a peasant girl... it has to have been the devil's work.
What about you?
Pierre Cauchon, Bishop of Beauvais. As you were captured in my diocese, the duty of conducting the trial falls upon me.
It seems that the English care more about you than the French.
Silence her!  Take her away...!
I -- I can't Jeanne... I can't hear your confession... I'm sorry...
I assure you, Charles, the Maiden has no greater admirer than myself. But whatever our personal feelings, we cannot allow her to conduct her own private war.  For the sake of the kingdom, it is imperative that you stop her going to Compiegne...
I'm... I'm not the king...
That's not a lot.
I know... but the English want her very badly, and I have to tell you that they are proving much more generous.
I know...
Jeanne, with respect -- we can't just attack the Tourelles like that -- it's a very complicated matter and...
I know what I'm doing, so either lend a hand or go back to bed!
Yes, it's a miracle.
As long as she brings food and supplies, she'll be welcome.
I... submit to Our Lord.
I had been sold to the English.  I'd rather die than fall into their hands.
Hey, my friend!  I'm glad to see your ugly damn face again!
God knows, but it was a bad idea!
A few teeth... that's the price of his life?
I said, kneel!
We still believe in you, Jeanne.  If it were up to me, I'd chase every goddamn Englishman into the ocean. But it's not up to us anymore -- it's up to the king...
I -- I -- I...
No... no... I'm just a messenger... He needs me... a higher calling...
YOU THINK GOD ISN'T BIG ENOUGH TO DELIVER HIS OWN MESSAGES?
I might ask you the same question.
No, no... I'm just so tired, and lost, and... I didn't realize what I was doing!
Why not?
What do you mean, they won't come?
Do you think this cross will protect you?
Good.  But "love your enemies"... body and soul.
Yes... of course... when you don't need me anymore.
Yes, my lord.
I need to confess again.
Whose were they?
I feel safe here.  And it's where I can talk to him.
Well, I try and talk to him, but mostly he's the one who does the talking.
I came specially to meet you today. I love your playing, but what a day to choose.
My name's Dorota, I'm Jurek's sister. oh! You're bleeding.
Christmas.  This is not a good time to have children. But then...
What's happened?
Where do you want me to go?  Look at me. No, no, I'm not leaving. Can't I take my chances here?
What, I'm working, what?
Oh my God, it's terrible, you've got to do something, oh my God!
Thanks.
I haven't seen him.
Tough luck.
What d'you mean, take the table away?
Okay, then I'll tell you something funny. You know who I mean by Dr. Raszeja.
Warsaw's not the only radio station.
It certainly was.
That makes a change.
Of course they'll notice it. But look--  This is a good place for something.
You don't know, believe me. They bribe the guards. The guards turn a blind eye. They're bringing in cartloads, food, tobacco, liquor, French cosmetics, and the poor are dying all around them and they don't give a damn.
Well, you know what's funny? You're funny with that ridiculous tie.
I didn't grovel, I asked him to help.
You have to have an employment certificate to work for one of the German firms in the ghetto, otherwise...
I didn't know you were in the certificate business.
Can you help? I've no money...
What d'you think I mean, Kitten? I forgot, that's what I mean.
It's a little cut, nothing.
Out of Warsaw. Where?
Stop it, Wladek.
Why didn't you come sooner? It's been over two weeks.
I was... I was trying to open this tin.
We're getting out.
No sound at all?
That is good, yes.
Ohhh ... dear. Not another word From the shock, yes it would be.
I'd like to make a swap.
I'll have to get lessons. It wouldn't be much use without them.
No, no payment. I have given it back. I don't want it.
The marks do not come out. They are scars and hardened skin.
What happened?
She says, throw the piano overboard.
Right through there.  But I wouldn't go in there if I were you. 
Billie.  You ready?
You just sit tight, old man.  We're gonna have to get you to a doctor.  I'll call a cop.
He won't know you're carryin' it. C'mon, you gotta help me out.
How bout you?  I'll give you the whole hundred!
Here.
I had some appointments.
Aw, I got a brother down in K.C., runs a freight outlet.  I can go halfsies with 'em!  It ain't too exciting, but it's mostly legal.
Hell yes.  He does this every year. There's nothing to worry about.
Well, hell, you got the whole Chicago south side.  How do ya expect the eight lousy spots I've got to compete with that?
He was a con man, wasn't he?
You ain't gonna have nothin' if you don't lay off them games of chance. There's a depression on ya know.
If you saved a little, you wouldn't have to grift so much.
I did.  That stuff I gave him was counterfeit.  They'll pinch him the first place he tries to spend it.
I'm busy, Floyd.
Who's got the contract?
Yes sir.
Yeh, Luther said you could teach me something.  I already know how to drink.
And a packing company, a chain of Savings and Loans and half the politicians in Chicago and New York. There ain't a fix in the world gonna cool him out if he blows on ya.
Why?
Then you'll do it?
Well we got some workin' money anyway.
No, not a thing.
Did he hold you up on anything?
Did he say he wouldn't?
A couple days; that's all I'm askin'.  I can stay clear that long.
You were right, Henry.  It's not enough... But it's close.
Fancies himself a gambler, huh?
If ya win it could make ya, too.
Gondorff asked me to look after ya.
I'll square it with the fixer.
Where you goin'?
You move right along, don't ya.
All right, when?
What the hell's the matter with you. We coulda met at a club or somethin'.
I feel lucky tonight.
He hired a dame to take it from ya.
Naw, he picked up some jane in the bar.  Can't see him till morning anyway.
That's worth fifteen grand to ya?
I am after this race.
Lt. Snyder doesn't know shit.
With 20% coming off the top for me laying your bet.  Either way you end up with 40.
Not if you want me to keep makin' 'em for ya.
There wasn't any way he coulda known we was in there.  We made a clean pick on the lock and didn't leave no footprints in the hall. Somebody musta wised him up.
For fifteen years.
Sure.  Every bunco man in the country knows Gondorff.
What the hell good is Hooker to ya?
He'll never do it.
You know how they are... sex...
Is that what it means?
It's all right.
He's just around the corner.
Don't start worrying about him. He's a good guy, but screwy.
Oh, Andy, Andy!
He's all right.  Isn't that enough?
I didn't.
It's a piece of evidence that's worth a great deal more than that.
And I'll give then proof!
was fascinated with you....  a real live detective....  You used to tell me the most wonderful stories.  Were they true?
Yes.
Hello, Nick!  And a party - celebrating father's third murder - 
Forgive me.  How are you?
Yes, she would.
If you think it'll be all right.
Goodbye, my boy.  Take care of Dorothy.  Show her that there is such a thing as a happy marriage.
Going to run him through the fluoroscope?
Do you mind if I come down and see it?
We hear this is getting to be sort of a meeting place for the Wynant family, so we figure we'll stick around in case the old man himself shows up.  Then we seen him...  ...sneak in and we decide to come up.  And pretty lucky for you.
We were looking for this bird.
What's he want of you?
What's that to you?
Oh, that's a phoney.  The men didn't even have to go down.
She's ready to talk.  It won't do any harm, though - to find out where he is.
No.
Well, thanks.  We'll call you when we need you again.
No.
That's nothing.  I saw him myself.
A brown suit, brown shoes and a white shirt and a grayish tie with red, or reddish brown figures on it.
What's the idea of telling me you just knew the Wolfe girl by sight?
Maybe if you quit running around after other women you wouldn't have so much trouble with this one.
You've said that for weeks.
Never mind.
He's not anybody.  Just a fellow I used to know.
Oh yes.  Why, you told me to sell them a long time ago.
But suppose some business comes up...
I trust you.
That's all right.  What are you drinking?
What's all the fuss about? Is he in hiding?
I hate to bother you when you're laid up.
Hello.... oh, just a minute.  Police department?
What do you think?
I tell you again, I don't want any part of it.  Now you take Dorothy home and...
You're lying, Mimi.  But then, you'd do anything for money.  You're getting a good price for saying you saw Wynant and you figure you won't get anything if he's dead.
I didn't knock Julia off.
Listen.  "Studsy" Burke told me you used to be O.K. That's why I'm here. Do  they....
If you like 'em like that.
That last Martini.
Take it easy.
You'll have to keep them anyway. The man at the Aquarium said that he wouldn't take them back.
He's got more sense than you have. Thank Heaven you're not on this case.
Yes.  I know all they know about the murder. And I'm a great hero. The Tribune said I was shot twice.
I don't know.
You talk as if I were Asta.
Come on, Watson, we're going places.
Looks like a hold-up!
I'll be all right.  I've got Asta to protect me.
Not with all your money!
Why, I believe the little woman cares.
That's a fact.
Several things.  Hello, Fred.  We're hungry again. Yeah, and lots of onions.  Oh, and coffee.
I remembered that Wynant had some shrapnel in his shin.  It often bothered him.  So I looked for it and I found it.  Gimme.
I can't help it. I can't tell a soul.  I didn't even tell Guild.
I'm going to give a party, and invite all of the suspects.
Thank you, Mrs. Charles.
I'm afraid you're lying, Mimi. You see, I really did see Wynant last night.
Let's see... where was I?  Oh, yes.  He went to find the man. That man was desperate!  He knew that he was caught dead to rights -- and with prison staring him in the face, he took the only way out. He killed Wynant.  It's terrible to tell you this way but your father's dead, Dorothy.
After our hero had killed Wynant, he got a brilliant idea.  He realized that he and Julia could still collect money.  Wynant was supposed to be on a trip - no one knew where - so our dinner guest wrote letters to Macaulay, signing Wynant's name, so that Macaulay would continue to send the money to Julia.  He even telephoned Macaulay --  Do you remember?.... the first day that you came to see me... he telephoned that he was in town?
I don't know.
Police!
Yes.  Nick!
I know I left them there.
Home!
I'm fired.
Y-yes.
Not up to us.  Up to the Iraqis.  All they have to do is get out of Kuwait.
You know so much about the Middle East, you know where we can get something to eat.
Help, I'm being held prisoner in a puzzle box factory.
There you go, Jaeger.  Just find the buried treasure, and you're a millionaire.
I'm thinking about when this war is over. Why you figure I'm here?  'Cause I got tired of being president of GM?  If a brother doesn't play ball, or deal drugs there aren't too many big money prospects around, and I'm not particularly interested in spending the rest of my life fighting the oil companies' wars. So I say if maybe there's something out there, what the hell, that's what I say.
We're going to keep driving.
Deserters would have run, they wouldn't have engaged.
Not much chance of that.  Jaeger's an idiot.
Probably was a couple of hundred years ago when whoever drew the map came through here.  Worn down to nothing now.
What do you figure it to be?
Basically.  But the map has been pretty precise so far.  I don't think it'll be too hard to--
Ready when you are.
You've had your say, Wes.  Now leave it.
He snuck in here thinking we were asleep, only I wasn't sleeping.  Would have slit our throats if I hadn't stopped him.
I told you.  He tried to steal our gold. He tried to kill us.
Doesn't matter.  Whatever he wanted he didn't get it.  We've got no need staying around here.  It's light enough.  Let's pack up and head out.
You said he was a deserter.
You don't know that.
We're at war.
I've got no stomach for murder.
I out rank you, that's why.
Lot of good you were when I was sinking in the sand.
What about Jaeger?
What are you doing?
No you're not.
There might be something in there.
OH MY GOD!
Christ!  Wes, tell him.  You know this stuff.
We disappear for awhile.  We disappear, we came back; nobody knows nothing.
What are you going to do with your <u>third</u>?
And I'm talking about enjoying myself.
I steady it out, they blow us out of the sand!
I didn't miss it.  I figured if you knew one of the reserves got hit you'd want to turn back.
Me and Wes are just going to talk.
I said be cool, all right?  Now be cool!
Just figure it's my map, I ought to hang on to it.
It's giving.
Someone's got to send the gold up.  It can't get on the line by itself.
Just had to get the pack unhooked from the line.  It didn't seem that long.
Northeast?  That's away from the Hummer; further into Iraqi.
It should, or it will?  Least going back the way we came we know what we're up against.
We need something:  A flare, a signal mirror.
I'm not like Wes.  Wes was crazy.
Yeah.  Well, me too.
You still got a map on you?
It's got to be going better than this..
I don't know.  He didn't have a uniform on.  He...he had on white robes, like the guys who killed Wes.
I don't know.  They killed Wes.
Then I'm a rich man.
Don't make so much out of it.  Only reason I haven't figured a way to get all that money for myself is because I've been too busy figuring ways to stay alive.  Believe me; if I had a minute to catch my breath I might have played things the way you and Wes had.  I'm no better than anybody else.  I've just been busier.
Thought you were going to buy a car.
How the hell should I know?
What?
A map?  All I got is maps.  I'm gonna have Delayed Map Syndrome when I finally get out of here.  What kind of map you need?  Topographical, geographical, thermal?
I could use some recon photos too.
Just...want to be ready when we do.
The photos.
Okay.
I don't think we'll go to war.  We shouldn't even be here.  This isn't our fight, it's a regional conflict.  It should be decided regionally.
Yeah.  So?
Come on, man.  I almost had this thing open.
This is so weird.  It's happening, but it's not.  It's like a TV show, and we're part of it.
What?
It's about a hundred miles from where we are now.  How long do you think it would take us to--
You know what I'm doing with my half?
We're not going anywhere.  Not 'til we get what we came for.
...I figured...I figured you'd turn back.
You have to go with us, Wes.
Those people down there are Shi'ites. You've got Shi'ites in the south of Iraq and Khurds in the North.  Neither of them've got much love for Saddam. Probably figured once the war started there might be an uprising, so he sent his soldiers out to slap them around some.
We have to do something.
Just seems weird they didn't chase us.
Yeah, we're down.
The white reflects the sun; it keeps you cooler.  That's why they wear them.
Cortex bonding....possible temporary.  Before you report a possible equipment malfunction, you check the subjects....?
I have to see SEN.  I've just been given a shift change.
Don't go.
You don't have to... I don't trust him.  You ought to file a report.
Looks like dirt.
What?
You don't know.  You don't....
AH UGH.
No one can see us now we're alone.
No!...No!...
A shelldweller.  They live in the outer shell of the city.  Quite unique, there have been two here before.  They smell.
I wonder how far he went.  He's gathered invaluable information out there.
Ask him about the air.  He looks out of breath.
You have nothing to fear.  You're safe again.
Where is LUH?
You know I have a way with the computers.  I can clear myself for any area.....almost.
What?
Look!
That way.
Too late....stay close.
What are you talking about. How do you know?  I need her!  I need her.  She needs me.  I've got to get to her.
I don't care.
No......  She's dead THX........
Hang on.
What do you mean?
Thanks.
That cop who bought it... you didn't tell us he was your partner.
Be cool around my men, they don't trust strangers. And try not to swear so much, it's unattractive.
Mike Reilly.
Anything else I should know?
Then let's go see what they missed.
I don't know. You tell me?
Well... it's more than we had ten minutes ago.
What?
Be right back.
Catch that alert? That's him in the U-Haul.
Cuz he got the girl, now he's leaving town.
Stay to your left.
Okay, one of the caps turns it on, the other shuts it down.
When in doubt, pull the yellow wire.
Call upstairs, see what you can find out.
Helluva fuck factor.
Let's face it, we all knew it would happen sooner or later. The guy who can build a mousetrap that's better than we are ...
Reilly! He's loaded!
Nothing... just tired.
We're moving' on. I have to pick up the supplies. Just two little boxes.
Lab's backed up, we're still waiting for it.
No shit. I better send Meg flowers just in case.
That'd be some explosive pussy he's got his hands on.
I gotta get back on top. Get off the sleaze detail.
Hell, I got a gold watch... it just don't work. Maybe they'll give me a new fishing pole, or something useful.
One of these days you're gonna get tired of fighting the shit. When that happens, you'll wish you had family.
Don't talk.
IRA - instant retirement account.
You mean you just--? ... You keep a record of... matches?
Someone who smokes French cigarettes.
I thought I told you--
She's refused to say a word to anyone. What made you think you could get her to talk?
I promised her she'd be safe.
And it had diamonds in the back.
I said, "Come in." And there he was. A fine-looking man with a moustache and long sideburns. He said, "Good evening. I'm the doctor." I said, "Doctor?" He said, "Yes, the doctor. I came to see about your tonsils."
So I said to myself, "All right, if he wants to look at them, let him look at them. No harm in that." And then he said, "Say ah." And then I said, "Ah." And that's all I remember ... And when I woke up, I still had my tonsils, but my pocketbook was gone.
You see--  No, no! And <u>yet</u>--  <u>Did</u> I--did--now <u>where</u> could we have--
Constantinople?
Let me tell you, Venice <u>can't</u> <u>compare</u> with Constantinople.
Umm.
Funny, the kind of men women fall for.
Smart. London, eh?
Funny--the first time I saw him I thought he was a doctor!
Yes, Baron?
But please, Baron. We're not supposed to breathe a word of it. You won't tell anybody I told you?
Are you insinuating that this is not an honest report?
Nervous! Why should I be nervous?
I know it!
Why should you?
Please.  When I came here it was for a little adventure--a little game which you play tonight and forget tomorrow. But something has changed me--and it isn't the champagne.  The whole thing is new to me. Very new. I've got a confession to make to you.  Baron, you are a crook.  You robbed the gentleman in two fifty-three, five, seven, and nine.  May I have the salt?
Thank you.
And take the twenty thousand francs ...
Seven and nine!
Darling!
Yes--Filiba! Venice--Grand Hotel-- room two fifty-three--
At twelve twenty. I know.  Lyons two, four, seven, one.  Two more days and we'd have seven hundred and fifty thousand francs more!
<u>Grossartig</u>--<u>kolossal</u>!
<u>Auf</u> <u>wiedersehn</u>.
Lily!
Yes.
Oh!
Don't be embarrassed, madame. I'll take it. I need the money. I wish I were in a position to ignore the whole matter. But you know, madame, the stock market, bank crash ... To make a long story short--a member of the nouveaux poor.
As you like. 
You think that's too much?
Correct!  Good night.
Afraid I'm ruining your reputation, M'sieu Laval?
You would?
Like that?
I know all your tricks.
Please! 
Thank you.  Seventy-six, eighty--
Divine ...
Yes, Madame Colet?
I'm sorry, madame, but there are still certain matters which I think you should attend to yourself. And I, personally, would not care to refer them to--to-- 
Well--uh--yes and no.
I'll do my best, madame, even if I have to work every night.
Oh, madame, you're just too sweet for words! 
Let me give you a little advice. When you embrace him, be sure to put on your gloves. It would be too bad if your fingerprints were found ...
Apparently not. Don't you know where it is?
But you saw it here.
Well, where is it?
The pumps --
About half, actually. Rose, you miss nothing, do you? In fact, I put in these new type davits, which can take an extra row of boats here.  But it was thought... by some... that the deck would look too cluttered. So I was over-ruled.
Take the elevator to the very bottom, go left, down the crewman's passage, then make a right.
Hurry, Rose.
A hundred and one next month.
Bobby, we're launching. See these submersibles here, going in the water? Take a message.
This is ridiculous, Lovejoy. Find her.
We're running out of time. And this strutting martinet...  ...isn't letting any men in at all.
There are still some boats forward. Stay with this one... Murdoch. He seems to be quite... practical.
I put the diamond in my coat pocket. And I put my coat... on her.
She knows.
There's no need for language, Mr. Hockley.  Go back and turn the heater on in my room, so it won't be too cold when we get back.
I see you had that undertaker of a manservant follow me.
Porca Madonna!! YEEAAAAA!!!
You see? Is my destinio!! Like I told you. I go to l'America!! To be a millionaire!!  Capito?? I go to America!!
Bollocks.
Ain't you boys ever rowed before? Here, gimme those oars. I'll show ya how it's done.
If you don't shut that hole in yer face, there'll be one less in this boat!
We've struck ice.
You're welcome. Rose.
That penguin last night, is he one of them?
Yes, exactly!
Oh, Jack... please don't judge me until you've seen my world.
Well, they didn't think too much of 'em in Paree.
You wouldn't last two days. There's no hot water, and hardly ever any caviar.
They didn't teach you that in finishing school? Here, it's easy. Watch closely.
A mistake?
I did, didn't I?  Look! A shooting star.
I don't think so. They've got you in a glass jar like some butterfly, and you're goin' to die if you don't break out. Maybe not right away, 'cause you're strong. But sooner or later the fire in you is goin' to go out.
Sssshh. Come here.
He's an ex-Pinkerton. Cal's father hired him to keep Cal out of trouble... to make sure he always got back to the hotel with his wallet and watch, after some crawl through the less reputable parts of town...
Come with me, Jack. I jump, you jump... Right?
I know, I know.
I'll be right back.
Just a few more minutes. It'll take them a while to get the boats organized...
And wake me, of course, if anything becomes in the slightest degree doubtful.
Someone named Hockley, I should imagine.
You had it the entire time?!
Excuse me.
Goodbye, mother.
Don't you hate people that surprise you? ... I do.  We can't stand here.
Do you want the truth, Anya?
Sure!
Don't be crazy--I'm tickled to death to see you.
This is Miss Marsh.
I can explain--
Will you leave me alone?
Sooner--if you like.  See you again, I hope.
That's a date. 
Yes--and <U>very</U> popular-- 
Sorry I can't return the compliment.
No!--Did <U>you</U> take that bracelet?
I'll bet a couple of hundred.
And me coming in with two pair-- 
That depends on how mother's feeling. You'll excuse me, gentlemen?
Never eat before the show.
Very--your mother?
But I'll have cocktails with you.
At seven-thirty?
I'll be there--Good-by.
Anything I can do?  I'd jump overboard if it'd help you.
I can't blame the ocean--it's you.
But--
Lonesome?
I think we'll live in Europe after we're married?
We didn't have enough dough for two tickets, did we?
No bank roll there, boy.  Lucky I could get you signed on--they picked up that Pittsburgh jeweler--made him talk. The heat's on, Shortie--and those Atlantic breezes are going to be mighty welcome.
Yes, sir!--I will, sir--Certainly, sir!
Shortie, look!
How're the tips?
I'll need it--gave my last buck to the bedroom steward.
Is that a nice way to talk to a pal?
Why <U>didn't</U> I think of that?--I am going to scout around and see if I can find her.
No, sir?
Now you're talkin'!
Oh, is she? What a shame!  You'll pardon me?
<U>Me</U>!
Where did you hide it?
Get it!
Why, you wouldn't quit when you're ahead, would you?
No, thanks--I never gambled in my life.
Some of the smartest robberies have taken place aboard ships--
I wouldn't be surprised--
Why?
Swell!
How about trying your fine Italian hand?
Thanks. That makes us square.
I'm O.K. It didn't hurt much.
Wait a minute--let's match for it.
She did?
In New York.
Not the <U>real</U> Chad Denby?--
This is a fine time to be asking that. You're on your way to France.
Who won?
Yes, a bracelet's been lost, but I'm still on my vacation.
But I'm not finished yet----And your waves are so colossal--rocking boats both to and fro--Oh-h, Atlantic, how I love you ----how I love you--
What's he got that I haven't got?
All right--don't spoil the trip with any of those jokes-- there's a nice bunch of people on this trip--nothing but class--I looked over the passenger list and they're all members of the Who's Who!
Oh,--I was having so much fun I almost forgot--
There's a lot of trout in this stream just waitin' for a fly.  I've already been workin' on a young fellow from Chicago--related to one of the big packin' families--on his way to Biarritz for a good time. Likes a little game of bridge and poker.
They're a cinch to read--Queen of Clubs--  --Ace of Diamonds. 
The country boy's about due.
About twelve hundred.
Don't kid yourself--you know how I stand back there.
Just smile again and be reasonable.  I'll order dinner here--just the two of us--like old times.
That's a bet--but I couldn't let you walk out like that, Sally. I'd have gone cuckoo back there--just thinking about you--
Not a chance--I'm through. 
Well, of course, I wouldn't take it.
He's a swell person. He told me he'd rather turn one guy straight than jug a million.
It all depends on what you're used to.
Sure, Sis.
What!--are you crazy?
Hey--you! Where you going?
Isn't that a daisy?
Now Ed, are we cross?
Not now.  I don't have time.
Beauty, ain't he?
Easy, Johnny.  Now ain't the time.  I tell you, boys, even I'm Worried what'll happen once Ringo Runs this outfit!  God have mercy!
Easy, son.  You just need to get Your feet back under you, that's All.  Come on, boy, let's kick South.  Down to the old playground.
They were all gonna jump me back There.  What ever happened to one Against one?
Excuse me?
Yeah, you look it.
Bless you, darling  Darling!  Are you mad?  You're not Wearing a bustle.  How lewd!
I been having the boy at the Hotel pack us up every night Since your streak started
Better.
Been hittin' it awful hard, Doc.
Felt his liver go on that last One.  Get him to a doctor or he'll Be dead in a couple hours.
A man like Ringo's got a great Empty hole right through the Middle of him and no matter what He does he can't ever fill it.  He Can't kill enough or steal enough Or inflict enough pain to ever Fill it.  And it drives him mad. Sick mad.  Cold and dirty.
How you feelin', Doc?
Hurts.  Hurts pretty bad.
Then what do I do?
I see, well this happens to be a Nocturne.
Sheriff, may I present a pair of Fellow sophisticates, Turkey Creek Jack Johnson and Texas Jack Vermillion?  Watch your ear, Creek.
Not half as bad as I feel.
Good God, you're really-
I know.  Me neither.
Colorado's closer
Yeah.  Or undertakers.
Not so sure.  Somethin' tells me It gets harder from here in.  Should've held out for more money.
How is he?
I'll be dipped in shit.  I will, too.
It rides right at 'em.  Like McMasters said, see it through to The end.
Wyatt Earp, I know.  I was Beginning to think we'd never Meet.  This is fortuitous.  That Means lucky.
They know.  It's the scent.  We Better split 'em up.
You'd die for fun?
What about her?
Well I ought to know my own mind And I'm tellin' you what suits me Is a family and kids.  That suits Me right down to the ground.  In Fact, that's my idea of heaven.  All right, what's your idea of heaven?
Well you're different, no arguing That.  But you're a lady all right. I'll take my oath on it.
I don't know, doesn't make any Sense.  I almost can't look at You.  Like it hurts.
Getting late.  We better get back.
Wyatt...
Don't worry, Doc, it's not your problem. You don't have to mix up in this.
Mattie, they're here!  Folks this Is Celia Ann but you can call her Mattie.  Or even Mrs.  Earp if you Prefer.
They're just lonely is all.  Hell, I howl myself sometimes.
Wyatt, what're you talkin' about?
Forget it, Ringo.
No?  Brothers to the bone, right?
Might as well hear him out. Anyways, what choice we got?  But no matter what happens, see It through to the end.  If you don't I'll curse the day I ever laid eyes on you.
Maybe, yeah.  Hell, I don't know.
Lotta law around here.  Just met the Sheriff.
Just his style, Morg.  Doesn't Mean anything.
Come on, we're not about pickin' Fights.  Just gonna keep a little Order, that's all.
I'm the one made a mess.  Made a Right fair mess of the whole thing.
That didn't sound like thunder.
Will somebody get the damn dog out-
Easy Morg, don't think about that now.
Don't need to go heeled to get The bulge on a dub like you.
Listen Mister, I'm getting' tired-
They're nothing.  They're nobody. I want the Cowboys.  All of 'em.  I Mean to break 'em up, drive 'em Out of the territory.
500... Year's wages.  And I never even saw a horse like that.
But she doted on the frowner
Hit a streak when we left.  Him And Kate.
Wait a minute, you thinkin' of Getting in bed with the Cowboys?
Easy, Virge, they're just tryin' To egg us on.
Wyatt, they're threatening our lives.
Wyatt, I know what I'm doin'.
Wyatt...
Ah, now that's the real mother- Lode in Tombstone.  Up and down Allen Street, full-blast 24 hours A day, liquor, hostesses, Gamblin', makin' money hand over Fist.  All except the Oriental.  On Account of the element.  Have a Man for breakfast in there most Days.  Regular slaughter house. High-rollers won't go near it. Too bad, nice place.
Curly Bill, huh?  Who was that Other idiot?
No, I gotta do something.  I don't Suppose you'd card-
Bring up the tracking satellite. And get 007 out of there.
We'll see about that.
Oh, please, Mr. Bond. We live in the information age! Information is currency - and with the right currency, you can have any piece of information.  Besides I own the phone company. What do you say? Twenty minutes?
Don't pout, Sidney. I invited him here hoping he might shed some light on your story. He's from 'Lloyd's of London.'  ...Aren't you, Mr. Bond?
Good-bye, Mister Bond.
My guards are from South Africa, Mr. Bond. This is their chance to get even with the formerly 'Great' Britain.  Now both of you. Put your hands on your heads, and step forward.
Take the girl. Leave the handcuffs. We'll drown her at sea.
I appreciate your time -
Where can I find him?
I don't care who you dial, so long as it's not me. Next -
Yes. The famous James Bond. I've heard all about you, sir. You were under direct orders to act as an observer - and yet you had to go off, on your own, like some half-assed CIA cowboy -  Endangering the gold, attracting that lunatic woman, and then putting in a distress call for us to save your bloody hide.
Is this another one of your games?
I've got half the British government breathing down my neck. I don't have time for your nonsense.
It's on the boat. He's holding a press conference tomorrow.
He didn't want anyone to know. He kept it out of the papers. He said a third wife was bad for his image.  You've got to protect me!
Political considerations?
Well... If you insist.
Not from forty feet.
Moving along -  A typical plastic security card. Name here, magnetic information stripe here -  And a code breaking microprocessor here. Swipe it through any card reader - anywhere - you're in.
Yeah. Russian Minister of Transportation.
Hell. The CIA built that club.
I'm not certain... But I think there's someone I want to press for some answers in Kuala Lumpur.
I hope so.
- You're not.
That's funny: you struck me as the kind of man who always carries protection.
Elliot Harmsway is my Uncle!
He was my father's best friend!
Don't say it.
You insist on calling all the shots.  And by the way: I am not a helpless girl.
... Didn't we once investigate Harmsway?
Hopefully, it won't get that far.
We've already done the interesting part. Do you forget?
Is that Mandarin, or Cantonese?
Excellent.
Seems to be back to normal, sir.
I see you two have met.
- I told you! He was there! -
...I see.
Thank you, Uncle Elliot.
Don't worry. Mr. Bond will get the message. So will his boss.
Approaching the first gate.
You come with me -  You stay here.
Yes. Shall we kill them?
Thank you sir! Thank you!
I don't know. He's not in the database -
Maybe. Maybe not.
Since when?
We got the same thing.
Junior spends time with his child.
You all don't believe me when I tell you I'm afraid of heights.
Maybe I can get down there next week.
I told you about calling me boy. I ain't no boy. See, you and Dad got a bad habit of calling me boy. You call me boy in front of my wife. You think I'm going to fix the roof? I hope the wind blows the whole damn thing off and it pours down rain.
I would like to finish reading this. What would I talk about? I haven't read this month's almanac. I don't care to hear about how the corn was this fall or how to get rid of gophers by putting garlic in their holes. They pride themselves in making life hard and that's not my cup of tea.
Will you still get the money from your father?
Why in the h...
Like a veil has been lifted?
You were in hell?
Well, you look better than you did yesterday.
What for?
I don't know what happened to him. He just ran out into the streets.  I got some old records I want you to hear. I like the blues sung simply, man and a guitar. Or sung by a woman who had bad luck all her life. Don't ever let anyone tell you his life's story if it is of a weary life full of sadness. When I was a boy, a man told me a story of how he lost all of his sons and I'll be damned if the same thing didn't happen to me.
Go back to sleep.
You and Babe Brother are so much alike...
Hush.
Babe Brother is a poor boy.
It would be nice.
You stay inside. I will see to them.
I don't want to hear any tales about colored people...
Why didn't you catch a plane?
It was slow. Now it seems like everyone is having births at home.
You should go back and rest.
She has a fish bone caught in her throat. Could all of you go in the other room? Gideon, get some bread and toast it quickly and find me the cod liver oil.
I'm glad you brought that up as to who you are. I have to know who is in my house.
You damn right they didn't, especially Emory, my cousin.
Last Saturday we handed out over two hundred meals.
Week by week the crowds at the door keeps getting larger. We can't feed all the hungry.
I know your mother ain't still operating that house of hers.
Speaking of tappy heads, we ought to have an old fashion fish fry.
Oh. I'm sorry. Gideon, what do you say?
No. No. No. No. I had my Child at Cedars and Sinai. And that ain't no county hospital. You have to have cash or check before you come in the door.
Junior's wife kept her afterbirth' in the refrigerator. That's why I do not eat over there now.
Everybody who have been associated with Harry end up with pennies over their eyes.
Don't shout!
Counting the gray hairs in your head.
Whadda ya think?
Now go get Molly.  Your friends are going to be here any minute.
Okay...
Oh, I'm sure he's there.  You're just not looking hard enough.
I wanted to thank you, Woody, for saving my flock.
Well sure, look at him.  He's got more gadgets on him then a Swiss army knife.
Merry Christmas, Sheriff.
Mm-hmmmmm.
HO-YAAAHH!!!
I need to repair my turbo boosters. Do you people still use fossil fuels, or have you discovered crystalic fusion?
No, you can't.
That wasn't flying!  That was falling with style!
Where?
That's why.  Sid.
But we're not on my planet, are we?
This is the perfect time to panic! I'm lost, Andy is gone, they're going to move from their house in two days and it's all your fault!!
Hey!!  Hey!  How are you doing that? Stop that!
Sorry guys, but dinner's canceled!
Don't you get it?!  You see the hat? I am Mrs. Nesbit!! 
I can't help.  I can't help anyone.
Eh, he's puttin' 'em in backwards!
Oh, what?!...What?!  These are plastic.  He can't fly!
Oh, quit your whining and pay up.
He's in the psycho's bedroom!
Murderer!
Outta my way!  Here I come, here I come --
Wait!  Wait!  I got a better idea! How about we DON'T?!
Come on.  Let's get out of here.
Yes!  Yes!  We promise!
Woody?  Who's up there with you?
I thought he was at summer camp!
Oh, I don't like confrontations.
So did I tell ya?  Huh?  Nothing to worry about.
Just stay where you are, Corporal! Don't move, Carl.  You'll blow up. I know you're tired!  I know your leg is cramping, but you can't move. Do you hear me?
Huh?
What?!
It's busted.
Speed up!
There's no mirror.
You're spoiling your pretty looks. Come here.
A sin against <i>what?</i>
Speak when you're spoken to. He likes his women quiet.
Do what?  Oh, I see.
Well ... yes. All right. But -
Finn -
I finished it off.
Storms?
We're too young.
Juliet who?
Victoria -
I can't find Manolo.
He never came home last night.  Was he with you?
He has debts.  He has gambling debts. He owes a lot of money.
Nine thousand dollars.
Arnie, this is crazy.
I tried, Arnie.  And, I will continue to try.
Carl, I'm running late.  I'm coming right now --
Drugs begin pouring out of America into every other country in the world. Canada is completely overwhelmed.
That's frustrating.
The first thing we have to do is present a unified front.
Look, I'm as worried as you are --
Not yet.
Hi.
Just watching you.
We watched his father get dragged away by federal agents.  I don't even know how to begin to tell him where you are or when you're coming back... Or if you're coming back.
What about legalizing everything? Has anybody talked about that?
You can't make me.
Yeah.
I feel good.
Nope.
We got you on tape making the deal. We got you bragging about the quality. We got you bragging about your business.  We got you.
I'm telling you, she doesn't know shit.
I don't know.
Oh, man, I've never eaten so good in my life.  Why don't you develop a useful skill?
Depends who it's from.
Depends on the state.
Yeah!
You're kidding.  Can't you shoot him or something?
Nobody said shit, Eduardo --
That thought makes me feel awful.
I hear these stories.  Your husband in jail.  His business in chaos. Various people fighting over the scraps.
You don't?  Listen to this woman in a man's world, a very violent world.
I'm six months pregnant.  I won't do it.
Fine, then we don't have a deal.
The police won't find your car.
An informant.
Everybody has a weakness.
I'm aware of that.
Which part, getting terrorists loose on bail or freeing convicted murderers on technicalities?
Any idea how much?
That triple the amount of stuff is going through.
This is a business.  Get the fuck outta here.
She hasn't called you?
We sometimes went downtown to score.
I can't believe you used to bring my daughter here, to this place.
Like you protected Landry?
Right.  Now it's used by somebody from the Juarez Cartel, one of his lieutenants...  Who knows?  Every damn day there's birthday party. At first I thought they must have three hundred children, then I realized they're taunting us.  Three miles away and we can't touch them. Ha, ha, ha.
What kind of research?
Bit fucking late, like.
Because I fucking told you to do that, you doss cunt.
But it's not worth more than fifteen.
Can you not go yourself.
For four fucking grand?  One palm tree, a couple of rocks, and a sewage outflow.
Diane.
I'm going home.
It's where I live.
It's Iggy Pop.
Unless you get caught.
What, and deny myself the only pleasure I get from him? Did I tell you about my birthday?
Oh, really?
And you might get the fucking job.
My problem is that I tend to clam up. I go dumb and I can't answer any questions at all. Nerves on the big occasion, like a footballer.
Goldfinger's better than Dr. No. Both of them are a lot better than Diamonds are Forever a judgement reflected in its relative poor showing at the box office, in which field, of course, Thunderball was a notable success.
Nineteen-sixty-seven.
Eh - Ian Fleming?
But you're looking better, it has to be said. Healthier. Radiant even.
And I wondered if you'd care to go to the park tomorrow.
Some of his solo stuff's not bad.
That's your theory?
I'm cooking' up. There is a silence.
Fuck you.
So he met me and I offered to take it off his hands at a very reasonable price, with the intention of punting it on myself to a guy I know in London.
Four Grand.
We're two thousand short.
Are you serious?
Sure, sure. I've heard it before.
Yeah, well, it surely worked for him.
Yeah.
It's really nice, Tommy. Can we go home now?
Look, Tommy, we know you're getting a hard time off Lizzy, but there's no need to take it out on us.
But where?
And how did you breach the Barrier?
Then I shall make use of this starship.
You doubt me?
Plotting our new course.
Jim...? Well, we're dressing informally, aren't we?
What do you know of my pain?
Perhaps I have a way to bring one here.
If we could send a distress signal...
That song did not come up in my research, Captain.
Spock, we're on leave. You can call me Jim.
Go to sleep, Spock.
I cannot be certain.
He reminds me of someone I knew in my youth.
What do you mean?
Mr. Sulu. Execute.
We don't have 1.2 hours.
An eternity during which we'll be vulnerable to Klingon attack. Korrd-you tell him.
Why didn't you tell me this before?
But the center of the galaxy can't be reached. No ship has ever gone into the Great Barrier. No probe has ever returned.
The emergency channel, open.
I'll take you to the bridge.
You can't expect us to stand by while you take the ship into the Great Barrier.
Now learn something about yourself.
Starfleet, are you aware of our currant status?
Uhura, I had the strangest dream. I dreamt that a madman had taken over the Enterprise.
I belong here.
I don't understand..  Reveal yourself to me!
This is my doing. This is my arrogance... my vanity...
Tried to.  Can't quite make the connection with that sucker, though. If I had a direct terminal ...
I was wondering where you got that glow of good health.
Uh... got any cinnamon?
I know, I met him.
Yeah...pain in the neck, you know, I was all set
I'm certainly not.
Yes, won't that be grand -- the computers will start thinking, and people will stop. Lora, I'm going to stay and run some data through. See you tomorrow.
Alan. Alan Bailey.
oh, you have Group 7 access, don't you?
We have to close that down, just briefly. Security reasons.  Someone with that access has been tampering.
Oui, da, yessiree, sure 'nuff, you betcha.
No...
No, nuh-uh, never in a million years!
So... Nice ship you got here. What's our next move?
It's my fault. I programmed you to want so much...
If you think -
The MCP is the most efficient way of handling what we do. I can't sit and worry about every little user request that --
Doing our business is what computers are for. Look, Walter, with all respect -- ICOM isn't the business you started in your garage anymore --
No... Tron ... must... destroy MCP... first...
They may be... de-rezzed... on the carrier ... hurry...
Where did you hear that name?
You know anybody that's got an army for rent, that's fine...but my, uh, User said to go take that sucker out. An' let's face it, the big ox isn't gonna get any weaker. I feel like hittin' him now, while I'm good an' mad. Some nerve... what does he care whether you guys get killed, long as he keeps rakin' in quarters?
I hate to disappoint you, pal, most-the time, that's how it is for Users, too.
Yes.
Well, great, that's no sweat -- I play video games better than anybody.
Oh, I was an actuarial program... worked at a big insurance company. It really gives you a great feeling, helping folks plan for their future needs -- and of course, if you look at the payments as an annuity, over the years, the cost is really
How 'bout yourself?
Alan-One...
We have to talk.
Swell...I'll log us both on, and you can get your Tron thing running...
I had to...in the games...
As long as it gets us out of here
Girlfriend, you got a man.  You				* just have to take control .  . .  set up the right mood.						*
Great!  You're going to believe that fat dweeb Mr. Hardy over your own daughter.
Yeah, Dad.
I'm not a pumpkin!  Okay?!!  Do I look even remotely like a pumpkin?! I'm not a muffin, or a cupcake or a honeybear either! And you don't understand anything Dad...
Dad.  You just think you know everything, don't you?
Yep.  Sleep fast.
She knows not to steal.  I've taught her better than that.
Don't be ridiculous.  She's only -- how old is she?
Right.  She's only fourteen.
Will you just open the door!					*
I thought you moved out.
Albert Gibson.  Three four nine nine one.
In her dreams.
She could be moving money, guns. Anything.
Goddammit!  That's outrageous.
I still don't believe it.
What about that time you trashed a six-week operation because you were busy getting a blow-job?
You didn't have sexual relations with him?
I'm giving her an assignment.  I am offerring you a choice.  If you work for us we will drop the charges and you can go back to your normal life.  If not, you will go to federal prison, and your husband and daughter will be left humiliated and alone.  Your like will be destroyed.
Here they come.
But you didn't.  Why not?
Yes sir.
That's right.  They want something...  dramatic.  I spoke to a number of people who said you're the one to see.
Is that why you got into this business?
Yeah.  It was great.
I'll just be a second.  So what happened tonight at the office?
It sounds wild.  So now you're a big hero, right?  For fixing their system.
Oh, sure.  Fine.  I'll get some more gravy.
I don't know anything about a faction.  I just met Simon...  or whatever his name is...  a couple of weeks ago.  I barely know him.
Three days later, he called me. He told me to meet him at Overlook Park.
Well, maybe a little.
Yeah.  I suppose he is.
No.
Answer the question--
No one must know!  Especially him.  You must appear to live your life normally, conveying nothing.  The security of this nation depends on it.  Can you do that?
Think carefully.  You will be lying to the man you love.  The person who trusts you the most.
The code name of your contact will be Boris.  Your code name will be--
No.  Doris.
Wait here.  If you have to use this, use it.  Don't choke. Okay?
I told the guy---  I told the guy, this isn't even my order.
Dance?
Red hot.  Her thighs steam.
You son of a bitch.  Did you really think you could elude us forever, Carlos?
No.  Soon as I turn you'll shoot me.
Kettleman, Barnes and McGrath. I'm a legal secretary.
Helen?  It's Simon.  Is it safe to talk?
Yes.  Now go.
Wait a minute -
What letter?
Clarence says we gotta be hittin' it.
Don't eat anything.
Ya looked through it?
My name is Clarence, and what is yours?
How 'bout me what?
There's nothing to tell.
Where are you from.
Would you like a bite of my pie?
What's the story behind you takin' a cab to the most dangerous part of town alone?
Five.
At the movies?
I'm not a theater checker. I'm a call girl.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Well, I wouldn't go so far as to call him nice, but he's treated me pretty decent. But I've only been there about four days. He got a little rough with Arlene the other day.
You will?
I just gotta get somethin'.
No joke. This is probably the best hamburger I've ever had. I'm serious, I've never had a hamburger taste this good.
You were chillin', kind of creepy even. You totally fucked with his head. I'm gonna go grab dinner.
How come?
You ain't kiddin', we got lives to start over, we should go somewhere where we can really start from scatch.
It is what I want. But I don't want to spend the next ten years in jail. I don't want you guys to go to jail. We don't know what could be waiting for us up there. It'll probably be just what it's supposed to be. The only thing that's waiting for us is two hundred thousand dollars. I'm just looking at the downside.
That rhymes.
Nigger, back off, you ain't beatin' shit. Now what would you do.
I don't blame you.
I was dying. I thought for sure everyone could see it on my face.
Well, you're gonna be seein' me shortly.
Get the fuck outta here!
Now tell him goodbye.
Well, she's a pretty amazing girl. What are women like out here?
Good for you.
Did you meet Captain Kirk?
He's nothing. He's in my acting class. But he works as an assistant to a very powerful movie producer named Lee Donowitz. I thought Donowitz could be interested in a deal like this. He could use it. He could afford it.
In case they try to kill us. I don't know, what do you want me to say?
How 'bout me what?
Ha ha ha. No really, where does it come from?
Look, Dick, I don't -
Do I look like a beautiful blond with big tits and an ass that tastes like French vanilla ice-cream?
Then why are you telling me all this bullshit just so you can fuck me?
No problems on both counts.
Yeah?
Have you read the story on Elvis?
Now that's bullshit, Lee. Every time you buy one of those little movies it's a risk. I'm not sellin' you something that's gonna play two weeks, six weeks, then go straight to cable. This is "Doctor Zhivago". This'll be packin' 'em in for a year and a half. Two years! That's two years you don't have to work with anybody's movie but mine.
Thank you very much, Clarence.
A Norms in Van Nuys.
I bullshitted him.
That's about all I ever eat.
Do tell. Why drug related?
That's what I've been tellin' ya. The guy was like a mad dog. So the cops aren't looking for me?
Well, son, I want you to know I hope everything works out with you and Alabama. I like her. I think you make a cute couple.
Yeah, well, just stay outta trouble. Remeber, you got a wife to think about. Quit fuckin' around.  I love you son.
Now I can't be sure of how much of what he told you. So in the chance you're in the dark about some of this, let me shed some light. That whore your boy hangs around with, her pimp is an associate of mine, and I don't just mean pimpin', in other affairs he works for me in a courier capacity. Well, apparently, that dirty little whore found out when we're gonna do some business, 'cause your son, the cowboy and his flame, came in the room blastin' and didn't stop till they were pretty sure everybody was dead.
I'm talkin' about a massacre. They snatched my narcotics and hightailed it outta there. Wouldda gotten away with it, but your son, fuckhead that he is, left his driver's license in a dead guy's hand. A whore hiding in the commode filled in all the blanks.
Sure.
What about him?
McTeague.
I don't see why not. When you gonna come round and see my new place?
Well, don't just sit there, shoot him.
Sure was.
I believe he believes him.
No don't sit here and feed us some shit.
Or a supporting actor -
This rabbit'll do anything not to do time, including wearing a wire.
You do.
Pussy love pink rocks.
Naw. It don't feel too good but it's alright.
If it came down to who eats who, damn skippy.
No way, Jos.
Where's that?
No.
I went to the surface and I collected specimens like I was told.
Cole, did you or did you not record that message?
And your only goal is...???
I need to go now.
They wanted identification.  I don't have any identification.  I wasn't trying to hurt them.
No.
You wouldn't understand.
Underground.
This is April, right?
1995?
Perhaps it was a wrong number...
Wait!  This is only 1989!  I'm supposed to be leaving messages in 1995.  It's not the right number yet.  That's the problem.  Damn!  How can I contact them?
No more drugs.  Please...
Ohhhh, that one!  Can we hear that one?
We dream about what's important in our lives. And I seem to have become pretty important in yours.  What was the dream about?
It wasn't me before, James.  It's become me now because of...what's happening.  Please untie me.
I thought you didn't know how to drive.
No.  I want you to turn yourself in, James -- It'll go much better for you if you do -- but I'm not going to trick you.
No!  I...don't think so.  I stole a car and they chased me.  I hit a tree.
First, it's important that you surrender to them instead of them catching you running.  Okay?
No, not really.  It's...it's in my mind.  Like you said.
It was?  I didn't...know.
...I had a dream about...something like that.
Shh -- don't talk.  Hold still.
Well, you look pretty different, too.
On the walls -- they meant the animals when they said, "We did it."
Airports all look the same.  Maybe it's...  James!  Your moustache!  It's slipping.
Scientists.  I'm supposed to report in to them.  They'll want to know they sent me to the wrong time.
What's that mean?
Not as bad as what they're doing to kitty.
It's private.
Cole!  Oh, God, Cole, where are we?
Well, the guard woke me up.  He told me I volunteered.
Yes, sir.
Okay, it was bad judgment.  But I have the strangest feeling about him -- I've seen him somewhere and...
He's been tested for drugs?
Were you listening?  We got two officers in the hospital.  Yeah, he's in restraints, plus the medic gave him enough stellazine to kill a horse.  Look at him!  Still on his feet.
Twelve Monkeys, honey.  Guess you folks didn't turn on your radio this morning.
You want something, old man?
You want something?
You can't do that yourself?
That's 'cause he's dead.
Or maybe you just think you do.  You can run just as far as you can, but wherever you go, there you are.
Ain't over yet.  Night is part of day; separate, but equal.  Night is when you let your guard down; when you see things in the shadows and hear things in the dark.
Well, a man with some gumption.  How much money you got?
That's my morning's pay.
Hundred and eight already.
You got two years on me.  What's that make me?
It will.
I got more brains than you've got teeth.
One way.
I'll give you the money!  Okay? I'll give you two-fifty.  Just . . . just, please.
Doubt it.  He's dead.  The Look Out's a cemetery.
Just a car.
Another accident?  You got to be more careful.
Well . . . parts, labor . . . let's call it a hundred-fifty bucks.
That's about an hour and a half longer than I usually spend looking for parts.  You're the one thinks that car's so damn fancy.  What you expect but fancy damn prices?
That's not just a Ford, that's a sixty-four-and-a-half Mustang.
I don't have a credit card.  They took my wallet.
You believe that?
That's a good piece of advice, Darrell.
What reputation?  You're nothing but an ignorant, inbred, tumble weed hick.
Listen you stupid fuck, I want my car.
What's the matter?  The fight gone out of you?  I'm just gonna smash a headlight.  Maybe two.
Open up!
What's it to you?
Honest like Al Capone on tax day. Where are my keys?
Baby didn't die.  Just froze off all it's finger and toes.  Just a little fingerless, toeless boy now.  But the husband; he sees what the wife's done, so after he saves the baby he locks the wife in the refrigerator to see how she likes it.  Now she died.
Yes.  Yes it is.
I . . .
Sheriff Potter.
I know.  I was here when your apprentice was helping you. Remember?
I picked them out for you, Jake.  I thought you would like the colors.
What are you afraid of?  I'm the one's got the gun.  Stay here.
Maybe, but if you didn't I think you would have kept on walking.
My cup runneth over, beauti--
May I carry your package, Grace?
Didn't have a choice.  My car overheated up the road.
I couldn't stay in this place.  I wouldn't.  I'd just pick up, do whatever I had to do, and get out.
I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to.
From my father.  He was the tribe's Shaman.
Those are white words, not ours.
It tells me what every face tells me.  Everybody has a past, they have a pain, and they have something they want.  What is it you want?
I have ideas.
Maybe I like to find out about a man first.  Maybe I like to know what he's made of.
Yeah, I guess you're right.
I'm still here, aren't I?  See this?
You could just leave him.
I think this heat is making me crazy.  I was crazy to come back here, I'm crazy for listening to anyone in this town, and I'd sure as hell be crazy if I spent another minute in this place.
It's not like he's a young man. He's had time to live.
I thought you couldn't leave.  I thought you couldn't get your car.
The only reason I stormed off is because you sort of spooked me talking about Jake.  But I've had nothing but time to think about it. It keeps coming back to you and me and us getting the hell out of here. But we've got to get the money, baby.  We get the money, I get the car, then we get the hell out.
I'm not sure where it is.  Not exactly.  I never saw it.  I just heard him talk about it.
Don't yell at me!
You heard me.  Count it out.
You killed him!
Just drive.
You're tense.  What are you all uptight about?
He was a crooked bastard.  He would have killed us.
It's not locked.  I left it open when I took out Jake's body.
A lot that means.
My car overheated.  I pulled in to have it fixed.
I've got to make a stop in Vegas, then I'm heading to Santa Barbara.
Got work.  I know a man who's got a boat.  Wants me to sail it for him.
Can't live with them, and you can't shoot 'em.
No.
I did?
You're talking like a mad man.
A man doesn't always mean the things he says.
The sooner it's over, the sooner you're on your way.  Now listen to me:  It's got to look like an accident; that's the thing.  If it doesn't, then it's no good.  I won't get a dime, and it's my neck that'll be on the chopping block while you're living it up somewhere.
Is the job done?
You didn't kill her?
I know all right.  I know you're just enough of a shit to have a go at bedding a man's wife.  You've probably bagged a few at that. You'd probably lie, cheat and steal without thinking twice.  From that you'd just turn and walk away.  But to kill; to get that blood on your hands.  You can't wash that off. You'd be a marked man for life. Just like Cain.  And you're a sinner who wants to walk with the saints. Ain't that right, boy?
I hate loving her.  I hate the kind of her person she is.  I hate having to tolerate the little games she plays.  I hate letting her use me. But I love her too much to do otherwise.  And I certainly love her too much to kill her.  I couldn't stand to watch her eyes roll back in her head as she sucks her last breath, or to see her pretty pink brains spill from her skull.  But you?  You got the killing in you, boy.
And next time, next time somebody is going to get dead.
Thirteen-thousand dollars.  Had you done it.  Isn't that what we agreed on?
You came to take my wife from me?
Christ, Jake, please--
You're not talking sense.
I don't blame you.  What man would? I admit it, okay?  I came back here and I made it with Grace.  But if you kill me you're making a big mistake.
Aw, Toby, we weren't doing nothing. We was just talking.
What?
That country shit all sounds the same to me.
I wasn't going to fight for you.  I was just going to beat the shit out of your boyfriend.
Get away from me!
Yeah, I know.  You're TNT.  Just like dynamite.  When you go off somebody gets hurt.  All right.  Let's do this.
You stupid punk!  You don't even know what you're fighting over!
I know, Mr. Vesci.  I know.  I was on my way to you, it's just . . . what a day I've had.  You're not going to believe what's happened to me. I had the money, I swear I had it. I was on my way to you when my car breaks down in the middle of nowhere.
With a shotgun.  It kills him, and it shreads the money.  I mean, what are the odds?
There's nothing in the trunk, Sheriff.
Eh?
You can't do that yourself?
He's only just dead.  What was I supposed to do with him?  I can't take him away anywhere.  And nobody wants to take him for me.  Do you?
Or maybe you just think you do. Just another small town. One guy chasing you. You go big town. Just gonna have four guys after you instead. Kiss kissy kiss. It gets down to one thing -- are you a human being or are you one of those hungry ghosts out there never satisfied with nothing? Cause you gotta remember you can run just as far as you can, but wherever you go, that's where you gonna be.
What do you want for free?
You afraid of the dark?
So, we're all just floating along like twigs in a stream, so enjoy the ride.  Is that it?
You got a lotta philosophy in you, old timer but you don't fool me for one second with all this blind man crap. One minute you lost your eyes in Vietnam, next it's the joint. Now it's a woman? I'm hep to you.
Things ain't always the way they seem. You got to ask yourself: is it worth it? Day comes Earthmaker is going to look in your fucking heart! Then you better know what it is you're doing. <u>Are you a human being</u> -- or just one of them hungry ghosts out there floatin' around?
You expect me to believe that?
Yeah, I know.  You're TNT.  Just like dynamite.  When you go off somebody gets hurt.  All right.  Let's do this.
Who the hell are you?
Accident.
Yeah, I know.  More careful.
An overheated car.
That's the sweat of a man who hasn't an honest bone in his body.  Don't be offended, lad.  A man who's got no ethics is a free man.  I envy that.  Beside, how can I blame you?  That Grace sure has a mind of her own, and a body to match, don't she?  Eh?
Can't live with them, and you can't shoot 'em.
Boy I think this heat's getting to you the way you're rambling on.
You're talking like a madman.
A man doesn't always mean the things he says.
What makes you say that?
I'm not your boy.  I don't like you.  I got no choice but to do business with you. Let's just call this a nasty little marriage of convenience.
How do you want it?
You want to do this yourself?  I don't have to do this, you know.
I like Darrell.  He may be an idiot, but he's my half brother. We own Harlin's together, yeah, that little redneck manages to get paid no matter how things work out.
You're too quick for me.
I wasn't going to fight for you.  I was just going to beat the shit out of your boyfriend.
Get it through your head, little girl; I'm not going for you.  If this Toby likes you, then if I were you I'd marry him.  You're not going to get much better in this town.
What the hell are you talking about?
Doubt it.  He's dead.  The Look Out's a cemetery.
Darrell--
Gotta run over to the yard and see if I can find a hose like this one, or close enough. Gonna take time.
Jesus.  Twenty-after-ten and it must be ninety already.
Hey, your ... what the hell happened to you?
To replace a goddamn radiator hose!?
Listen, man.  I got rolled half an hour ago for everything I had.
I don't have a goddamn credit card.
You son of a bitch! I'll have my lawyers shut you down.
Open up!
No! No police.
Do you have to call me that?
You should be more careful.
Why you say that?  Just because I help a lady with her package?
Not until my car's fixed.  I don't know how long that's going to take.
All over.  Chicago, Houston, Detroit.  Just lately Dallas.
Good, 'cause I liked what I saw.
It tells me what every face tells me. Everybody has a past, they have a pain, and they have something they want.  What is it you want?
What?
Like you.
Nothing like a little liveliness.
Maybe I like to find out about a man first. Maybe I like to know what he's made of.
Depends on what you call love. I grew up on a reservation. A patch of desert in the middle of nowhere. That's where they stick Indians, Bobby. That's where they leave us to die. My brother killed himself when he was 19 cause he couldn't take it anymore. There's no hope there... Jake was my ticket out. Mom and me.
I'm still here, aren't I?  See this?
Walk away.
Oh yeah. There's nothing else with Jake. He don't trust banks. He keeps the money in the floor right under the bed. He loves it so much, he wouldn't think of spending any of it on me. I never seen it but I know he's got more than a hunnert thousand at least...
There is no us, remember?
Stop it.
Because I know you're full of shit.
I came back for you; this morning I came back.  Before I even knew about the money. You're what I want.  The only reason I stormed off is because you spooked me talking about Jake.  But I've had nothing but time to think about it.  It keeps coming back to you and me and us getting the hell out of here.  But we've got to get the money, baby.  We get the money, I get the car, then we get the hell out.
I ... nothing.  I just stubbed my toe on a rock.  Hurt like hell.
Good thinking.  What's all this?
It should be just up ahead.  Hold on ... there!  There it is!
You could give me my gun back.
My mother died in this canyon.
And love's a funny thing.  Sometimes I don't know if I want to love you...
Harlin's.
Yeah, fell down and hit a rock. Not as bad as it looks.
Sounds like it. I wish I could help Sheriff, but I just want to get my car and get on up the road.
Which you don't have.
...Now, let me get this straight. Two years you give me problems with your fuckin' payoffs. Now you owe me thirteen-thousand dollars, you call me - collect - then ask me to wire you one-hundred-fifty dollars just so you can get your car fixed.
But, in particular?
One way.
Morning Sheriff. Got my drapes.
I know.  I was here when your apprentice was helping you.  Remember?
Yes, yes, hit me...beat me, please.
You didn't hear something?
You stay away, Jenny.  I aim to mess him up, and that ain't a thing for a woman to see.
I am Russian, da! I am also <u>rich</u> Russian, da? Maybe we work something out, my friend Sheriff?
I want my lawyer!
Four.
I'll keep it in my office room.
He's asleep.
No that's it.
What was that?
It's finished. I won.
I don't know for sure.  ...I don't think so.
You've misunderstood.
But not a knife?
Have you ever tried to develop it?
It's a pleasure to meet you. I'm David Dunne.
Yes he is.
Send him packing. I'm not walking all the way over there.
In under six seconds.  I've heard.
Jeremy if you pull that trigger I'm going to leave! I'm going to go to New York.
That's what I said to my son. He said, there's always two kinds. The soldier villain who fights the hero with his hands, and then there's the real threat. The brilliant and evil arch enemy who fights the hero with his mind.
How long have you been married?
Football wasn't the kind of life I wanted... For ten years I'd be by the phone waiting for a call telling me he broke his neck in a practice game. And if it wasn't that call, it would be a call telling me he blew out his knee or suffered his third concussion. I've seen way too much of it in my job... I can barely take it when my clients are in pain.  I don't hate the game. I admire the amount of skill it involved and, like everyone else, I was in awe of how he could play it, but I couldn't give him my heart and then have something happen to him. And it always does with that game.  It's not a thing many people would understand.
I believe comic books are based loosely on reality -- I believe there are real life equivalents of the heroes in those books that walk the earth -- I believe your husband is one of those individuals.
We ain't got it. We ain't got no money.
What wife? He don't have no wife.
I wouldn't point no pistol at nobody, sir.
Ha. He was building his fucking porch.
'Course he's coming.
Hell, you know how Skinny is. Says he's gonna shoot 'em... an I says, "Skinny, you can't do that," an' he says, "Well, then get Little Bill down here an' let's settle this" an' I says, "Bill's sleepin', Skinny," an'...
You don't look nothin' like me, mister.
I brought your hat. You... left it down at Greely's.
Advances?
I admire that, you being true to your wife. I've seen a lot of... of men... who weren't.
I heard that one myself, Bob. Hell, I even thought I was dead til I found out it was just I was in Nebraska.  Who's your friend?
Oh yeah.
Alive?
Those cowboys messin' him up?
Huh? Hullo, Skinny. Snuck up on me.  How do you like her?
Well, uh... it ain't loaded.
A book, huh?  I guess that means you can read... An' I guess you boys seen them signs about surrendering your firearms... But then, like you told old Andy there, you ain't armed, are you, Bob?
Duck, I says.  "You have insulted the honor of this beautiful woman, Corcoran," said the duck. "You must apologize." But Two Gun Corcoran would have none of it and, cursing, he reached for his pistols and would have killed them but The Duck was faster and hot lead blazed from his smoking sixguns." 
Well, Mister Beauchamp, I was at the Blue Bottle Saloon in Wichita the night English Bob killed Corky Corcoran... an' I didn't see you there... nor no woman, nor no twogun shooters nor nothin' like that.
But he was called...
You... you mean...  English Bob killed him while...?
He will be hurryin' and he will miss. That there is as fast as I can pull an' aim an' hit anythin' more'n ten feet away... unless it's a barn.
Then he will kill you. That is why there are so few dangerous men like old Bob there... an' like me. It ain't so easy to shoot a man anyhow... an' if the sonofabitch is shootin' back at you... well, it'll unnerve most fellas.  Look here, let me show you somethin'.  See this here pistol?
Silky an' Faith, they rode off to the East an' two deputies was followin' them.
Nobody didn't kill Ned, he went South yesterday. He didn't even kill nobody. Why would anybody kill Ned?
About where you an' him  was... an' where you was from... an' what your names was... an'...
Not on purpose. But he started hurtin' him worse... makin' him tell stuff. First ned wouldn't say nothin'... but Little Bill hurt him so bad he said who you was...
Like I was sayin' you don't look like no meaner than hell cold-blooded damn killer.
I'm a damn killer myself, only I ain't killed so many as you because of my youth. Schofield Kid, they call me.
Well... you don't look so prosperous. Hell, you could buy her a new dress out of your half. We could kill them two an' you could buy your wife one of them fancy...
Oh.
I don't never see nobody anyhow.
Wasn't nothin' said about no partner.
I was gonna kill them two by myself. It don't take three.
Lookin' at?
Well... I don't recollect.
You boys are crotchety as a couple of hens.
Maybe, maybe not. Got him in the gut, I think.
Well, he's holding on to his shit like it was money.
Shit... I thought they was gonna get us. I was even... scared a little... just for a minute.  Was you ever scared in them days?
You better get on back, Miss.
I thought you wanted to buy spectacles an' fancy clothes an' all.
Huh?
Eleven.
Sally?
Well, she...
Yeah.
I know it's rainin',  Give the Kid a drink, why dontcha?
Two.
Steal it? Naw, I didn't steal it.
Naw, son, I didn't kill nobody.
I seen two fellas followin' me, I guessed they come to kill me.  We didn't talk about no other fella.
Yeah?
He's blind, for Chri...
I don't like the question.
Shit, Kid, you pulled your pistol... right outta the lady an' out the back window.
All of it. About him, an' you an' Uncle Pete... about robbin' the Rock Island Pacific... an' about them Missouri Banks.
An' if I spot 'em?
And ?
He says he knows his face. He sees it when he closes his eyes.
He says the hair is longer and lighter.
Just forget about it.
Goddamnit.
No. It's never going to stop, period. It won't take more than a week before every investor in this city is walking away from us. It's finished. I'm finished.
Alright.
I don't know what you came here for, but we won't have any part of it.
I hope I didn't disturb you.
A glass of water would be nice.
Do your friend a favor, Fenster, keep him quiet .
This whole thing was a shakedown.
So why the hell was I hauled in and cavity searched tonight?
I don't know. Who was that guy that used to talk about Soze in New York?
What do you care what he says?
Did you hear what he just said?
McManus has a friend in the Fourteenth Precinct. They're coming out for one job - Thursday. They're picking up a guy smuggling emeralds out of South America. Fenster and McManus have a fence set to take the stuff.
Some guy in California. His name is Redfoot.
They're pretty pissed off. They'll do anything. Now I got a way to do it without killing anyone: but like I said, they won't let me in without you.
Not if we do it my way.
Something - I don't know.  I ever tell you about the restaurant I wanted to open?
This I had to see myself.
Mr. Soze made a few calls, yes. You were not to be released until I came to see you. It seems Mr. Keaton's attorney, Ms. Finneran, was a bit too effective in expediting his release. Holding the rest of you became a moot point.
We know you can get to us, and now you know we can get to you. I'm offering you the chance to call this off.
Ain't it a crime? Call if you're interested.
What'the fuck is that?
He didn't have my lawyer.
Come on. Keaton was a cop for four years. Who else would know the Taxi Service
I don't think you do. But you say you saw Keaton die. I think you're covering his ass and he's still out there somewhere. I think he was behind that whole circus in the harbor. My bet is he's using you because you're stupid and you think he's your friend. You tell me he's dead, so be it. I want to make sure he's dead before I go back to New York.
Convince me. Tell me every last detail. 52    SCENE DELETED                                                              52 53    INT. HOSPITAL - DAY                                                  53                         + Kovash's room is now filled with people. Jack Baer stands next to DANIEL METZHEISER, a balding man in his forties. Next to him is Doctor Plumber. Across from her is Ridgly Waiters.
If there is a Keyser Soze he'll be looking for you.
So why play into his hands? We can protect you.
Wait a minute.
He wanted me to live.
May-I be frank, Counselor? I suspect your political power as much as I respect it. I don't know why Mr. Kint has so many faceless allies in City Hall, and I don't care. The embarrassment he helped cause the city of New York will not happen here.
Then prosecute. I will be very impressed to see if the District Attorney manages to bring in twenty-seven simultaneous counts of murder against one man with cerebral palsy. I would think a man with your job would agree with these alleged &quot;faceless people in City Hall&quot; you mention.
Nothing.
Neither does he.  That's where he loses.  This man's scared to death to go to court.  We only have to call his bluff.
Yes.
Yes.  It would be.
And no one will know the truth.
Frank Galvin's ... who's calling please?  Bishop Brophy's office ...
What does it mean?
Yes.
I was her doctor.
What did these people do when her heart stopped?
Tell me one?
She THREW UP IN HER MASK.  Let's cut the bullshit.  Say it:  She THREW UP IN HER MASK.
That's right.
Yes.
My God, we tried to save her...You can't know...You can't know...
Just as you are, Sir...
No.
No.
I am seventy-four years old.
...one moment, Mr. Concannon...
Thank you, your Honor.  Further: Ms. Costello is a rebuttal witness. As a `Surprise Witness' she may only serve to rebut direct testimony.  As her only evidentiary rebuttal was the admitting form, which has been disallowed I request that her entire testimony be disallowed and the jury advised that they must totally disregard her appearance here.
It's a crime.
Yes.
`They lied.'  Indeed!  When did they lie?  And do you know what a lie is?
After, after the operation, when that poor girl, she went in a coma. Dr. Towler called me in.  He told me he had five difficult deliveries in a row and he was tired, and he never looked at the admittance form.    And he told me to change the form.  He told me to change the one to a nine.   Or else, or else, he said...  He said he'd fire me.  He said I'd never work again....Who were these men...? Who were these men...?  I wanted to be  a nurse...
Hold on a second.
Is that what a good doctor would do?  How old are you, please?
'Code Blue'...
The Doctors were not negligent.
From what I've seen, Mr. Galvin, you have a very good case...
Yes.
Why?
Okay.  I'll meet you here.  Tuesday night ... I gotta go.  You going my way?
This is a complicated case, your Honor...
Ready, your Honor.
Thank you, your Honor, I'll continue.  Dr. Thompson.  Did you examine Deborah Ann Kaye last night at The Northern Chronic Care Facility?
If I may be permitted to question my own witness in my own way...
And don't give me this shit, 'I was a lawyer, too.'  'Cause I know who you were.  You couldn't hack it as a lawyer. You were Bag Man for the Boys and you still are.  I know who you are.
Damn right I'm done.  I'm going to ask for a mistrial and I'm going to request that you disqualify yourself from sitting on this case. I'm going to take a transcript to the State and ask that they impeach your ass.
Noted.  Thank you.   Miss Costello was a rebuttal witness.  Her sole rebuttal was the document,  which has been disallowed...
Let me talk to Mickey.
How come you're calling me from...?
Yes.  Price...
And what are you?  A cop?
My ex-husband was a lawyer.
Maybe what?
And is that what you're going to do?    Is that what you're going to do...?
What...?
We, we...No...we just had a small reversal in the case... I have some, uh...I have some work to do...
You're talking like a drunk.
I...
Who told you that?
If I don't 'grow up...'
No...no...
Dr. Gruber's not in.
He's not in, Sir.
Dr. Halpern's taking all his...
He's...you can't reach him, Sir. He's in the, on some island in the Caribbean, they don't have a phone.   He'll be back in a week...  If you'd like Dr. Halpern's number...
What?
So what...?  The best is yet to come.  Check the TV Guide.  They got our Dr. Towler on a panel on GBH on Friday: 'The Healing Hand. The Experts Speak.'
I'm swell.
All right.  Who wasn't in the O.R.?
What did she do?
...you need some old forms that she had...somebody's dying...
I don't know.
It's locked.
... You saw her?
... and I have inquiries out to doctors, experts in the field ... there is, of course, a problem getting a doctor to testify that another doctor's negligent ...
I, what are you talking about?  I talked to her this morning, and she said...
She did?
How old is he?
You're really...  You, are you the one they told me was the nurse?
Mrs...
Yes.
Yes.
Yeah.
Yes.
Yes, the roving nurse...
We had rather more important things on our mind than taking notes.   We were trying to restore her...
How'm I doing so far?
I married into it.
No, to be honest, I find it dull.
No. But one assumes obligations. My wife's family is all gone; someone has to look after her interest. Her father's partner runs the company yard in the East -- Baltimore -- so I decided as long as I had to work at it, I'd come back here. I've always liked it here.
I'd say you'd better take her to the nearest psychiatrist, psychologist, neurologist, psychoanalyst, or plain family doctor. And have him check you both.
We're going to an opening at the opera tonight. We'll dine at Ernie's first.  Which is easier?
Carlotta Valdes was what: your wife's grandmother?
What happened?
0h, I thought so! A pick-up!  Well, you've got a nerve, following me right into the hotel and up to my room! You beat it! Go on! Beat it!
Your name. And --
Tomorrow morning.
No, Judy, you don't understand.
I just want to see you as much as I can!
Why?!
No, it's not right.
No, I don't want any clothes! I don't want anything! I want to get out of here!
You can.
Ah, no!
Madeleine died here.
So am I, But it has to be done. I have to tell you about Madeleine, now.
No.
I wanted to drive you home. Are you all right?
No! No, thank you!
We have.
Well... anywhere in particular?
Wander separately? Ah, but only one is a wanderer. Two, together, are always going somewhere.
If I've been there? That's silly! Either you've been to a place or you haven't.
Oh... some, two thousand years, or more.
I don't like them.
No birds live here.
Long ago...
A grave...
No.
And so explain it away?  But there is a way to explain it, you see. If I'm mad? That would explain it, wouldn't it?
I'm here, I've got you...
Why? What's happened?
Only this far.
No, never!
Please let me go.
Why?
Would you tell me, who has the room on the second floor in the corner, that corner?
Please answer my question.
How long has she had the room?
When she comes down, don't say that I've been here.
Ah, Johnny-O...
Uh-huh!
Okay.
This is a cinch. I look up, I look down. I look up --
Oh, damn it! Damn it, damn it --
Well, who? Come on, you know everybody.
You haven't told me everything.
Carlotta?
All I said in the note was: "Where are you?" That doesn't sound desperate to me.
Good. I've always said you were wasting your time in the underwear department.
What does a big old wooden house on the corner of Eddy and Gough Street have to do with her?
But you said grey, sir.
How soon can it be altered?
Excellent.
Don't touch her. Call 911.
Bullshit it's not accesory. I didn't do shit. You call the cops, you explain it was an accident...
It's sacrilegious.
Over eight years of some of the hardest raging experiences of my life.
What?
Listen to me. Please. Everybody just calm down a bit here. Okay... First...are we sure she's dead?
You're a lying deviant. What did you do?!
We have a dead woman bleeding all over the bathroom. What options? Call the police.
What were we doing officer? Why didn't we help her? Well...we're all a bit high, you know, bachelor party, that kind of thing. Fisher here is getting married in three days...Beautiful wife ...he didn't have anything at all to do with it...It was all Micheal here... just Micheal...
According to Jewish law, the blood and limbs are considered to be part of the human being. They must be buried together or their souls won't rest in peace.
Open the suitcases, unpack the body parts and reunite the limbs.
They're on me. They're smoking me out!
They won't figure it out.
It has to be done.
I got you.
You're a liar. I want to know what happened in Vegas.
Sweet deal.
Great. Fine. Perfect.
I'm just gonna let her know I'm here.
Not tonight.
Jack Kerouback, Herman Melville, Henry Miller and Hunter S. Thompson. I dedicate this evening to fear and to major loathing. So from sun set to sun rise, let me be heard...
Here's his head.
Well, I didn't mean it.
No.
Good God...Good God...
I'm calling the police.
However it goes, the point is, nobody says anything to anyone ever. Right? ...Right?
What did you ask me?
Say it again.
You want to know what you are doing here?! You are love pumping. You are protecting all that is sacred and beautiful and in sync with poetry and sunsets and little newborn babies. You are walking the walk. This is it Fisher, the real stuff. You love this woman. Love is second to nothing. I love you. I love Moore. I love Micheal. This car is full of love, and nothing - absolutely nothing - supersedes love, man. Nothing. We will do what it takes. Whatever it takes.
What are you going to do?
What does that mean?
Yeah.
You're sick.
Not a prayer.
True.
And what happens when you can't?
They have a president. A Benjamin Yahoo something.
What?
You will not screw this up.
How about my Fatburger?
I don't think so.
I'm not sure.
Yup.
Yes.
I didn't mean to Liz. I'm sorry.
What?
I suppose Boyd is the creative force behind all this.
You don't like Moore? Since when?
He's weird. And I expect more from you.
You're going to be hungover for three days. Like those guys on "Oprah" that get drunk and have disgusting sex with prostitutes and then say their vows with the stench of cheap hotel whore sex all over them.
I've seen it on television.
Honey I don't have the time...
We're leaving in three hours.
I love you.
I'm mad at you.
"At first I thought it was infatuation ...But oh it's lasted so long..."
Well, can you come back inside?
Now?
Can we just talk this out?
I won't even discuss it.
I need you to pick up the cake tomorrow.
Do you love me?
Oh Liz. We. God. We, in Vegas. Micheal crushed her skull. She was dead. There was nothing else to do. It was an accident.
No Micheal did. It was an accident.
Micheal, by accident.
You never walked away dad. You could have walked away.
I love you dad.
OK, OK. You guys just go back in. Dad, keep going with the toast, we'll be right in. Go on.
You're not breathing right?
Buzzing?
The wahoo?
No. No. No. This is my doing. You see I'm gonna have my wahoo spark for my own. For Lois and the kids, for my brother, for Franco. I'm gonna turn myself in. I am all that. I'm gonna do it for sweet Lois.
I got to agree with that.
What?
Greenpeace?
Did he try to kiss you?
Yeah. I'm thinking about Micheal's Franco Harris fixation. You know how Micheal was always harping "Immaculate Reception?" I've seen that play. A lot of times...and I have to say this... Franco was lucky. Flat out, right place, right time. That's it. He was where the ball bounced. You get me?
So where to on the honeymoon?
That's our plan.
Fish, I'm really sorry. I just...I owe you man.  Desert.
No, the children sleep with me.
You'd like me to kill them?
It's a present from my parents.
Tell me the answer to this! What bird lays eggs in a barn?
What's that?
You'll think you're still at the convent.
Evil.
Wasn't that cowardice?
You must be out of your mind. I've been so happy these last few days -- now you've spoiled it all.
Go away! Leave me alone.
But what can I say to her, sir?
I didn't want to do it, Don Jorge. They made me ...
Come on, miss. Just so the Virgin can be really pretty.
Do you have great devotion for the Virgin?
Why do you say that? Perhaps the young girl is a bit jealous.
It's Viridiana. She's getting on my nerves.
No, not mad at all: she's rotten with religion.
Run and get something to mop it up with, quickly.
I'm bored. I'm alone all day and I don't know what to do.
That's life. Some people are brought together, others are separated. What can we do, if that's the way it happens?
There are some curtains and drapes, but they're all very old.
Are you Jorge?
It's about time we spoke to each other, isn't it?
Leave him alone.
I'm not sure yet. I've had a shock recently, and I'm only beginning to get over it. Perhaps I'll go back to the convent one day.
Then let him go and he'll follow you.
Stop this!
Is anything the matter, Mr. Mayor?
Very, very?
This louse is looking for trouble.
But, miss ...
Yes!
In any case he's asking you to come and stay with him.
Mother.
I had so many things to think about!
When you are, miss.
I've had a gutful of this.
Don't pay any attention to him. It's very good.
Hello.
Today, a good girl.
Yes, yes, I saw you!
I accidently triggered a protection mechanism which erased the entire program.
Madison lives two blocks from their present location.
He would slaughter eight people sitting in a room, but not two prison guards?
I'm getting by.
Don't give up, Parker. Not ever.
What she's going to do is get in my way.
Where's my gun?
Then I guess we're even.
On my life, I promise you I will.
I don't set policy.  You have the key?
You're going to put your theories to practice. I'm sending you into the field.
Letting a lunatic like Parker Barnes loose in the free world is like lighting a fuse. At some point, he will go off -- you saw what happened in the simulator. The risk to the public is unacceptably dangerous.
Call off the manhunt looking for me. I didn't kill the transport guards.
Sid is smart enough to know you'd check everywhere in the immediate area. Whatever the device is, he's probably got it timed to move into position just before it detonates.  Have the demo teams check every subway tunnel, water pipe, gas pipe, and sewer pipe that goes under, over, or into the arena.
Do I get to see it or not?
You're...such a wimp.
This is supposed to be years away.
What I need is a nymphomaniac.
Think hard -- it'll come to you...
True genius is rarely rewarded within its lifetime.
All my work is my finest.
I think I understand what you have in mind...
What do you expect me to do, thank him?
In other words, par for the course.  How do you feel about the simulation you participated in yesterday?
It was just like before, wasn't it? Wasn't it?  But you are making progress. Instead of killing seven people to get the one you're after, this time there was only one other person involved.
I've been in prison, remember?
For murder, though it have no tongue, will speak with most miraculous organ.
Give me a goddam break. I'm not going to go anywhere alone.
Thank-you.  Her name is Karin.
Start of what?
You like baseball?
I told you before, Grimes liked to be obvious.
Part of him is.
You don't know?
Duck!
Performing solo.  Enjoying the concert so far?
Let me put it to you this way... whether I'm here... or whether I'm not...I'm leaving an indelible mark on the world tomorrow night.
At this stage, you either get form or function. You said she wanted function. I gave you function. What are you complaining about?
You're with him tonight, watching the President's Speech, when the President...
I could tell you stories:  Cecil B. Demille:  Alright? The Greatest Show on Earth:  He needs an elephant,
Okay.  Okay.  The <u>Suitcase</u> Bomb...
Gonna be fine.  Gonna be fine, people?  Are we getting there...?
...can we have a white one...?
Listen to what I've ... listen to... does anybody know Morse Code?
Indeed it is.
Look, look, look....  He's fine, as long as he has his medication.
No, no, no...
What rig?
Okay.  And she's alleging...?
What difference does it make if it's true?  It's a <u>story</u>, and, it <u>breaks</u> they're gonna have to <u>run</u> with it -- How long've we got til it breaks? 
One day, Two days?  <u>Course</u> it's gonna hhhh....
Lookit, don't worry about it.  It's not a New Concept. Wake me when we touch down, will...
Who's gonna tell'em.
The Hostages...?
In the yellow ribbon.
Big Bird touches down <u>when</u>?
Get on this, right now...
...this's <u>good</u>...
Is she saying this in Albanian...?
<u>So</u> forth...
Knock on wood.
Yeah...what was I talking about...?
We're gonna do the <u>Team Song</u>.
I'm doing my job, Too.  Would you give me a... do you think you could call off your Dogs for a minute.
No.  No...Pentagon says, Army's got'em, they got'm in ..."Custody"... 
It's the Pride of a Job Well Done, Stanley, yes, but it's <u>more</u> than that.
THE GROUP WATCHING TELEVISION.
ON THE MEN, IN THE ROOM, ARGUING ABOUT THE ILLEGAL ALIEN, SCHUMANN IN THE B.G.
From whence did it come?  Our information states it came from a small group of armed, dissidents.  Of Armed and Violent Dissidents...
...we own it?
How's our friend?  What is he, "dead?"
...what is this?
Six to five and pick'em...you wanna <u>chance</u> it...
I'm <u>doing</u> my job, Mr. Brean.  That's what you see me doing here.  What <u>is</u> it you thought <u>you</u> were doing?
I have.
You're goddamn right.  And it's got nothing to do with the B-2 Bomber. 
I'm here, Mr. Moss, because you've shown yourself a great supporter of the Party.
How you going to stretch it?  This won't hold for eleven days.  Guy fucked a twelve- year-old...whadday're gonna do to hold that off?
Why Albania?
The... 
Is that true?
I'm sure they do.
"Freedom."
Ten Days.  There going to be any Back End in this thing?
Did we ever use those costumes for the Border Patrol? Those guys in the Leopard-Skin <u>Hats</u>?  Here's my idea....
What do you mean he won't do it?  He won't do <u>what</u>?  He won't do the sp...  It's what?  It's <u>corny</u>?  <u>Corny</u>?  Is that the word?  Of <u>course</u> it's corny.  We wouldn't have him <u>say</u> the flippin' thing it wasn't corny.  Put... listen, it's not a question, we're locked <u>in</u> to this speech.  NO We're, Are You Listening?  LOCKED IN.  We're, we're playing way <u>past</u> it, we're <u>past</u> it -- it's the set-up for...he has <u>got</u> to say the speech.  Tell Ames to meet me at the West Gate in... 
You do your job right, nobody should notice.
Yes, but I, well, <u>you</u> know...
Well, yes, but the guy <u>did</u> bring Peace.
...the Albanian Campaign.  This... this is history...
...givem what they want...But...
Yeah, well, perhaps...  Speaking of which:  I have a <u>prescription</u> here, I'm going to give you the <u>number</u>, I need you standing by with a <u>crate</u> of the stuff.... it's ... what is it?
Watch me.
Deal's changed.
Too Texan.  Go with the stick.  Thanks.  <u>What</u>...? ...does it have to be <u>Albania</u>...We're locked into Albania...why?
Why are they ...
And what?  What?  She was Driven From Her Home, by Albanian Terrorists.  It is her we are mobilizing to defend... it is "she"?
Better.
By the  media, by, yes, by, in this case, our organization.
I'm just talking about the Hats.
...this is nothing.  This is nothing. D'you ever shoot in <u>Italy</u>?  Try three Italian starlets on Benzedrine, this is a walk in the park...
That's right, we'll take a nap.  We'll get you to Washington, we'll get you Back to your Buddies, and...
They don't know what's going on!
Sounds like a french word, what is it?
Give me that phone.  Yes, sir, this is the manager. What seems to be the problem?
...sounds dubious Chuck, but Piping Rock any day.
Yeah, but he didn't see me.
Look Dad, I'm not a salesman. How many times I gotta tell you I'm an account executive, and pretty soon I'm going to the investment banking side of the firm.
50 K don't get you to first base in the Big Apple, Dad, not any more. I pay 40% in taxes, I got a rent of 15,000, I got school loans, car loans, food, park my car costs me 3 bills a month, I need good suits, that's $500 a pop, shoes...
...Work okay?
Alright. Why so pissed?
... Dad, you should've been a CEO. How about dinner?
No, what I see is a jealous old machinist who can't stand that his son's become more successful than himself.
Your responsibility, Dad, is to present the facts, not your opinions, to the men... you're gonna destroy their lives, Dad! Don't do it to 'em. Give it a chance. Let the membership decide for themselves, Dad. Please.
...have a nice day Mr. Stone.  ... Mr. Gekko, the conference call is ready. Mr. Sugarman and Mr. Lorenzo in Delaware. Mr. Bernard in Los Angeles. Mr. Jackson and Ms. Rosco in London. They're all on.
Good. Then call him back. And call me back. Don't worry.
All right, Bud... let's do it.
He never told me...
So you say. Nice to meet you; hope you're intelligent. Like these, how'd you get these? 
I just want to let you know Mr. Gekko I read all about you at NYU Business, and I think you're an incredible genius and I've always dreamed of only one thing -- to do business with a man like you...
...Yeah, and we're working on some other interesting stuff.
There was a crash last year. They just got a favorable ruling on a lawsuit. Even the plaintiffs don't know.
I know...the decision'll clear the way for new planes and route contracts. There's only a small float out there, so you should grab it. Good for a five point pop.
What about it? You work hard. I'll bet you stayed up all night analyzing that dog you bought. And where'd it get you?... my father worked hard too like an elephant pushing electrical supplies. And he dropped dead at 49 with a heart attack and a tax bill and the bank pissed on his grave and took the house; my mom ended up working in a dish factory... Wake up pal, if you're not inside you're outside. And I'm not talking a $200,000 a year working Wall Street stiff flying first class and being "comfortable", I'm talking rich pal, rich enough to fly in your own jet, rich enough not to waste time, 50-100 million, a player Bud -- or nothing. You had what it takes to let through my door. Next question: You got what it takes to stay...??
But we don't want to be greedy now, so let's let him have it at $72.
...Gordon.
How much is enough Gordon?
Obviously...
Oh it's just a rental. I'm moving to the East Side soon. I've got a couple of deals brewing with Gordon.  but that's just conversation... what about real things? Like dinner. The two of us. Friday. Cafe. Santo Domingo.
Break it.
I'm kidding, I'm kidding, we're still young, Darien. So what's money anyway when everybody's making it, it's all relative. After all, this is not the house in Connecticut, this is just a crash pad good for a couple of years...before we slip our two lovely kids, Yuppie and Fruppie into the Lycee Francaise.
That's right -- one with high yield, rich assets and no downside...
Get in bed. Y'ever hear of the sixty hour work week? You're turning into a yuppie Frankenstein, you love money so much.
Talk about being bent over the sink of life and being dry humped. I handed it to him on a silver platter. I told my father and those people...
You're not exactly pure Bud, you went after Gekko with the same vengeance you went after me. Look in the mirror before...
Get the hell out!
...Janet get my father on the phone and the two other union reps, urgent...
No such thing Bud - 'cept death and taxes. Not a good company anymore, no fundamentals. What's going on Bud? Do you know something?  Remember there're no short cuts son, quick buck artists come and go with every bull market but the steady players make it through the bear markets.  You're part of something here, Bud. The money you make for people creates science and research jobs. Don't sell that out.
Those days are over, Gordon. They were over a long time ago.
No, are you crazy? And I don't want him ever to know. Do you understand?...
Now tell me, why would I want to do that?
Cause I have a way around all this, a way we can all make money and make this airline profitable again. What do you say we cut to the chase. I'm asking for a modest twenty percent across-the-board wage cut.
I'll have a letter of agreement drawn up within two days.
With Mark?
Businessman!
So why are you dating Jonathan?
About what?  About us.
I'm sorry I'm not that good at languages ok?
Thank you Jenkins
A party at a waxwork huh?
They seemed, closing by much 
I don't know.  I really like you and I think you're very attractive.
China
Right behind you.
So Mark, what's so urgent?
Oh really?  We're they `us'es' or `them's'?
But mom, I NEED THE CAFFINE - BADLY
Oh! The virgin has spoken! SARAH Stop it!
I know he does.
What do you mean?
Your husband?
Because, I don't know, because sometimes...sometimes I forget things...and ever since Caitlin left, ever since my daughter left for school, there've been...I fainted and...  Why is this so hard?
Try to communicate with her somehow.
Isn't there something called group hysteria?
Have you been hurt?
Um...
She isn't here.
I've never even met you.
You do?
Thank you.
Yeah.
I'm not.  We...we met at a party.
Of course.
And there's this brilliant conductor in purple briefs with no bangs cursing his ass off in Finnish.
Why does everyone find that so surprising?
Yep.
...no...no...no...
I don't...
No, you're not.  But a presence in your house is not something to be taken lightly.
Hartford?
I was down in Adamant...
All of us.
No.
It's Saturday.
Yep.
Genetic repair mechanisms in eukaryotic organisms.
Nice.  Almost done.
Not the focus.
Yup.
Not like this.  We were never like this.  I want to go over there.  After dinner, we can--
I'm stuck here for another couple of hours.
There were some noises.  I didn't want to disturb you.
That's just mean.  Oh.  Jody wanted to know if I could get her some.
What?  No.  No.
What's going on, Claire?
Dinner.  With Stan and his new girl.
Yes, tonight.  We're going to be--
I know I'm not at the center of the bridge.
What can it hurt to talk to someone?
Ever since the accident I've been worried that you'd been unhappy, or...
But then you've been so much better...
Claire, please...
Are you glad?  I'm glad.
What's wrong with me?
It's her.  This is the woman who I've seen.
Yes.  The ghost.
Stop...
...Please stop...
Oh God...
What did you think I would do?  Jesus Christ!  I gave up my life and my music...
And then out of nowhere, some bright young woman found me attractive...
...would do anything just to be around me.  And I slipped.  God help me, I slipped.
She's gone.
Okay.  Don't...you don't understand what this is.
I did NOT!  I did not kill anyone.  Jesus. Claire, listen to me.  I walked in and she was lying there dead.  I swear to you.  On my life!  She took pills and she killed herself in our house to destroy me!  To destroy us!  If I hadn't stopped by here before school, the painters would have--
:Oh, I wish. A woman wouldn't have screwed over the woman she loved. No, they don't think that way.
Michael - you loved that house as a child.  You could work again! You could make it ours. We'll sweep out the horror.  And Lasher with it!
But you've not told Michael.
Two what...?
You sound certifiable. Yon know that.
Michael, Rowan should -
Nothing was ever more false.
Nothing worse than a common tool.
Mm-hmm.    Seems & lot longer.
Hell - Julien believed it... Carlotta too... and god knows, more than a few of us called her a witch!
Rowan Mayfair.  Who's calling...?
I under5tand.  All the same
It was quite warranted by the - situation.    I realize this is a shock, but really, Rowan - you never even knew her. It's not as if you've suffered some great -
You - are - a - murderer.
FAST.
He just went out like & light-
I 1ove you, Rowan.  I've always loved you.  I only wanted to be in your thoughts. To bring myself into your thoughts - so I could be as we are now.
I love Michael...
Leave me alone!
I don't know what you are!!!
I guess so.  The trick is remembering how to act like one.  I'm glad you called, Mr. Curry. I wanted to see you.  Why don't we go to my office...
Nothing.  Absolutely nothing-
The one time I want it to work...
Really...?  Your family there...?
Mm-hmm.     Scared-  I feel a little like the moth and the flame.
Okay.     y'all make sure and come back now, reeeeal soon - yu'heeyah.
Just sit there and soak up the vitamin D.
You stop it.  you're loving, and gentel..  You're the most remarkable woman I've ever met --- so stop telling me I don't know what I feel just cause you're scared.  Cause it won't work.
Mad. for each other.
Michael!  Jesus  I've been trying -
Is it more or less crazy than dying and coming back to life with hands that can see...?  God, Michael --- what am I...?
He's in there!  Or are you out for a stroll in the garden ...?!  where are you, goddamnit...?!
Let's see.
Than letts get rnarried, Michael.  I could put a spell on you - and make you say yes.
That's GREAT!
Mm-hmm...
I love you too.
Talking to me dear...?
A bit much.    Lucas.
I just - hate it when they're - finished.
Left behind...?  This about Rowan...?
Is that a crack about our singing...?
No tax shelters.  No funding.  I want to fund the clinic - exclusively.  The Diedre Mayfair Research Clinic.  I'd like to find an existing building and move in immediately - while we draw up plans for new construction.
Don't mention it - now can I get back to my accounts, or do you want to fillet me?
CHIC MAGAZINE?
No - not all the time - I mean
I'm terribly sorry - I have a bad memory...
Yes - I have had it for years.
Yes, two please. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to pry, it's just that I really loved your book
Yes - I'm sorry ELLEN...
Yes, one and a half please.
You don't know?
There isn't that much - you didn't even taste it - What's wrong - don't you like my tea?
CRAP! - I wish I had taken a photo of your face when I gave some to that DETECTIVE - What's wrong ELLEN - you look pale - maybe you have been eating the wrong kind of foods lately - it could be food poisoning?
I don't know - it's your house ELLEN
You heard me - keep away from him
I had an accident - I fell down stairs...
Get out...
That vibe is from your wrist, pal. You've been over-tenderizing your meat, again.
Were you always this sick?
Sorry. Ginger got a little, you know, enthusiastic.
It better not be my Aunt Trudy.
I love those springy head puppies!
Oh, god.  Look. Look.
God, I love being dead.
From your lips, to God's ears.
Yeah?
I do? I mean, yeah, I do.
Do it?
You expect me to think at a time like this? There isn't a drop of blood in my brain.
We want you to go to college, find a career you love, marry a nice girl from a nice family, and live happily ever after.
Dad, please.
Of course we are.
Well, why should I?
Yeah.
Like one of those "National Geographic" specials with the topless chicks?
I guess it's better than having tribal patterns carved in my face.
We're grateful, Ted. It's not that. Those Craftsman tools...they're a dream come true.
Hi ho, Silver.
I always knew there was more. I felt it.
Hmmm?
Whatever you want.
Hang in there, I'll think of something.
I see, so you'd be open to little ladies from Pasadena, who want to show you their knickers?
She knew exactly where you were staying, which you neglected to tell me, your own brother.
Most places are, Jimmy.
So, what brings you here at his hour?
You want it in writing?
The school dumpsters used to overflow to the point where the stench was unbearable. My award winning expos changed all that. The city added an extra weekday trash pick-up.
Your article sucked.
You never know around here.
I bet there are lots and lots of mirrors on Planet Ted.
A father is nothing but sperm, Ted. It takes a real man to be a dad.
It's incredibly simple.
Then you'll see who's really holding on to you.
There's gotta be something. We have to dig deeper.
Wearing them?  Or humping them?
You lose trust in someone and it's over, done, gone, forever.
Trust is something you earn, over time. You don't just inherit it overnight like a gazillion dollar empire.
Very ambitious. I like that.
I know where you can find any number of naked girls who'd love to hop on board.
I graduated from college. Did great, summa cum laude and all. And I'm about to launch a brand new magazine called "EXPOSED!"  An homage to Miss Julie Conroy of Xenia, Ohio.
But how would we pay our bills?
Like what?
Thanks, Principal Merkin.
I guess you won't be wanting that Rolex I sent you, then?
Rules are rules.
Uh, sure. Uncle Billy.
Just a couple of finishing touches. My parents always said you never get a second chance to make a good first impression.
YOU? Nervous? Why on earth should you be nervous?
Really? So I'm doing OK?
I can't wait to see the pictures.
You're right. I should work, too. Our first issue together is almost ready to print.
You're a great kid. Don't you forget it.
My job. Back off, Benedict.
I... You know... I...
The teeth doin' any talkin'?
I was wondering if I could ask you a few questions.
Was there ever any kind of investigation...
And the child...
And the other girl, Kelly.  Suzie's niece.
Was there penetration?  Did he put himself inside you?
That's okay, Kelly.  You're doing fine.  But I have to ask you something here. When you say it hurt.  Was this the first time a man was inside you?
I... he had my wrists pinned behind me. I remember my hands were cold.'
No.
Back to the land of grownups.
Still doesn't explain why he couldn't catch up with her.  I mean how long does it take to put on a shirt?
You're telling me you believe the guy?
Yeah, well, Van Ryan got his.  I don't imagine he gives a shit now.
It's a shithole.  But she was dirty, what was I gonna do?
Lombardo's settlement?
Her father didn't leave her squat.  The kid's got money in trust from her grandfather, but she can't touch that till her mother dies and Sandra seems to have the idea that Kelly ought to learn the value of a buck.
I net a guy in a bar.
What?  You wouldn't go after some guy you thought raped your daughter?  Cone on.  She bought the same story we did...
Those are Suzie Toller's teeth.
The blood type on the rocks matches Suzie's.
Did he come in with you?
No.  He stopped by himself.  Okay? That's all.  Let me go.
I think she's acting.  I think she set it up to be alone with him because she wanted him to come on to her.  I think maybe she's upset that he didn't...
You heard Kelly say "Sam."  That was Lombardo on the phone.  And you saw the girls...
You think this is just about money, about us looking foolish?  Question him. You're gonna find a stone cold manipulative psychopath.  And those girls are going to wind up dead...
I wanna go home now.
Okay!  He did.  He pushed me to the floor and he did it to me.  Now, can I go home?
No!
Hey, you're working for it.  Least you're supposed to be.
Yeah, but...
Yeah, but he can't push you around like he can me.  You've got family and they've got clout.  With we it's different... with me...
I'm scared, that's what.  I'm scared there's no one to trust.
I think we just need to get wasted.
You all gonna go down to the Caribbean together?
I'm not on your property!
Whichever one I want.
I miss Dad.
I was raped.  By Sam Lombardo.
Stick?
There was no way.  That cop would've gotten her to tell him... everything. She was weak and dumb...
Hello.
Duquette.  Forget him...
Ken.  I'm in some trouble.  I need an attorney and you're the only one I know. So I figured I'd start here.
Good.  So what we're going to do is march right to Hunter's doorstep.  We're going to insist they take a statement. We're going to tell them to charge your ass or get off your back.  They're walking a fine line here. Defamation of character, malicious prosecution...
Fair enough.  Let's go make a statement.
Where she lives.  In the guest house. Now will you tell me what this is about?
So Suzie, you called us, remember?
You got something against cigarettes?
Is this supposed to mean something to me?  What triangle?
The one you bought at school.
Sit down, Lombardo.
The bitch shot me, is what happened.
That how you planned it?  You take cut Suzie, get me to hang it on Kelly, then dump me in the ocean...
Shut up.  Don't fall apart.  The only people who can blow this is us. Remember?
The guy was history when he killed Kelly.  You knew that.
That was the same thing Ray said.
Hi, Sandy.
I'll bet.  Look, Sam.  Why don't you come by this weekend.  We'll take the boat out...
Jim West.
Funny.  So am I.
Your train?  Listen, friend, you're obviously lost.  ... I've got orders here to take possession of this train and to investigate a certain crime.
If you're implying our little imbroglio has reached an impasse whose only resolution can be found in a more primitive fashion, then I for one am fully prepared to do so... al fresco.
Wouldn't dream of it.
Put them all together and what do we have?
Then why kidnap them?  Why not just kill them?
All what?
I was six.  And ever since, my policy is: Act first and worry later.
I thought all you needed were your fists and your gun.
I find most criminals slip up somewhere...
Sure.  We have no idea what's going on.
Shhh!  Come on.  Tell us something!
Sounds like a train.  Looks like a train.
This?  I'm testing a new spirit gum, to see how it holds.
My disguises have helped me solve many a difficult case.  I spent three years on the stage, you know.  Remind me sometime to regale you with my Lear.
Oh, no, we split him fifty-fifty.
Not likely.  There must be tracks of twenty different wagons.  Freight wagons, carriages, buckboards...
Oh, I see, an easy plan!
In the next two minutes?
Like hell!  I'll see it through! Ram the bastard!
You tell me.
I've had some practice.
That'll be all, boys.
This is Colonel Richards.
Exactly.  Any number of nations would love to cripple our scientific growth.  And what better way to tip the scales in their favor than by killing off the greatest minds this country has produced.
I deal with some tough customers.
Restrain yourself, Voltaire.  He's just the sort of coward who would shoot an unarmed giant.
Exactly!  You are on foreign soil. You are a representative of the occupying forces.  Or haven't you checked a map lately?!
Easy?  Easy?  On just what grounds should I take it easy!?
Who were they?  What do they want with me?
Who was this partner of his?
For the moment.  But I fear not for long.  I'm of no use to him now.
They're not after me.  They want the baby.
Yes...?
My prsence cannot extend beyond this forest.  But I can give you these...
If I'm not strong enough to be your apprentice, how can I do this?
I have no family.
He's no magician.
These burns.  My arms.  Ouch...
These Pecks make terrible nurse- maids.
Who?
Want me to carry Elora?
Ahhh!
Madmartigan, you promised me you'd take care of Elora Danan like your own daughter.  She is all that matters.  Are you going to abandon her?
No, it's too big to be a Nelwyn baby.  It looks like a daikini...
No!
I must concetrate my imagination...to creat a new...reality!
I can't remember all these things. What am I learning?
That's the life spark.  Exxence of magic and sorcery!
Shhhhh!
We need blood.  To nourish the stone.  charge the stone with ener- gy.
His will.
No!  Change me back into a sor- ceress, Willow.
There's nobody here.
He never misses.
Us??  We'll never catch them.  Any- way, we're all done, Teemo.  Let's go home.
Who is that horrible friend of yours?
I know she's hungry.  I tried to feed her but she wouldn't eat a thing.  I'm not a wet nurse.
Queen Cherlindrea?
Who??
How are we going to get out there?
The sorceress.
That's none of your goddamn business! So keep your goddamn holier-than- thou mouth shut!  Anyway, they like Fred.
I thought I was the English.
It's been a while.
Yes, sir.
Black... I understand. What else,Sam?
Okay, Mr. Book.
It's them, Sam.  Now, Sam, listen to me and listen to me carefully. Listen to me as you never listened before.
Got to, Sam. You and I are going to a courthouse together, put some people behind bars.
Sure have, Sam.
If there isn't I've just wasted the last six months.
Johnny 
Don't try me, Johnny!
Move! Or you die right here!
Gunshot... they'll file reports... they'll find me.
Nobody meant any harm. The boy was curious. I unloaded the gun -
Something wrong with buttons?
Not long... A few days.
I see.  But I hope you have a lot of sugar.  Eli is ready to go to Zook's.
Aren't you? After today?
Land! Are you crazy? I'm no Amishman and I'm no farmer! I'm a cop. That's what I know and that's what I do!
That's your way, not mine.
Where's my baggy pants?
Probably.
Yes.
You're not carrying a bullwhip... how'd you manage to put my kids to work?
Fred. The way he looked when you screamed at him.
His name is John Book.
I have committed no sin.
You are acting like one!
Yes. Samuel! We're going.
I don't think she knows.
They don't have any shit.
You might have killed him!
Oh, but he doesn't do it every day -- just once or twice a week.  And he can't catch her old cat, anyway. And now she says she's gonna get the sheriff, and --
Yes, darling.
There, there, lie quiet now.  You just had a bad dream.
I saw you tinkering with that contraption, Hickory. Now, you and Hunk get back to that wagon!
If she...
Is morally, ethic'ly
Please, sir.  We've done what you told us. We've brought you the broomstick of the Wicked Witch of the West.  We melted her.
Ohhh!
Well, gee, I try and have a heart.
No -- No!  It was an accident! I didn't mean to kill anybody!....
That's a good little girl.  I knew you'd see reason.
No, I'm afraid I didn't.
But, how do I start for Emerald City?
You don't need to be helped any longer. You've always had the power to go back to Kansas.
Yes.  Say goodbye, Toto.
Why --
Well, I -- I can't quite see.  Why, she's crying.
Oh, no -- no!
But -- what's this?  I thought you were going along with me.
But you couldn't have been, could you?
Oh, no, no!  I won't let you take him!  You go away, you....!  Oooh, I'll bite you myself!
Stop her!
Oh, goodness! Did any of them sting you?
Oh --
You've had plenty of time already!
Yes...!
Lions and tigers and bears!
Lions and tigers and bears!
Yes.
Why, I'd thrash him from top to bottomamus!
I'd wrap him up in cellophant!
It may be just a cricket Or a critter in the trees.
Are you gonna stand around And let 'em fill us full of horror?
Oh -- does it hurt you?
Yes -- that's true.
I don't see how.  You weren't around when I was stuffed and sewn together, were you?
Oh, no -- please.  I have to rest for just a minute.  Toto!
Leave her alone!
Ah --
Yes. Dorothy -- ah -- Dor --
Don't you start it, too!
What was that?
I -- I -- I -- I -- gotta get her outta there?
All right, I'll go in there for Dorothy -- Wicked Witch or no Wicked Witch -- guards or no guards -- I'll tear 'em apart.  I may not come out alive, but I'm going in there.  There's only one thing I want you fellows to do.
Now...
Wait a minute. This is the left one. He walks bad enough already.
Yeah --
Not nohow!
B-B-B-B-B-But if we do that, we'll have to kill her to get it!
It's empty. The tinsmith forgot to give me a heart.
Hurry -- hurry --
Don't cry -- you'll rust yourself again!
Ho -- ho --ho
I can fairly hear my heart beating!
Oh - look out.
I haven't got a heart But I got a palpitation.
It's a whozis?
Now, now, don't fret.
We'll get you together!
Dont know any doctor jokes.
Its part of some plan. She dresses it up like a terrorist attack.  The explosion covers up the theft of the plutonium.
Elektra King.
Makes her look even more innocent.
Like riding a bike.
Perhaps after this ... test?
Quite the opposite, in fact.
Since Oxford. I knew him when he had nothing but a brilliant mind and enough guts to conquer the world. Hes a man of great integrity.
Sacrifice the girl to take out the terrorist?
Hes not through yet. Renard doesnt blow up five million dollars unless he knows theres more coming in. Hes working for someone. Someone who wants to stop the pipeline.  And they hired the perfect killer. One with a vendetta against King...and you.
The worm on the hook again.
Which is neutral, no doubt.
And we know how difficult that can be for the Swiss.
You think I fear death? I welcome it. I get on my knees and pray for it. You, on the other hand, you have something to live for, no?  Shes beautiful isnt she? You should have seen her before. Flawless, and still so innocent, not such a whore in bed...
Perhaps Sir Robert had a word with the Man Upstairs.
Yes.
Always wanted to see the upper lines.
I know.
I have to go.
No. Youll be safe here.
You had your chance, James. Now Im looking for a bigger thrill.
Shush.
I used my body on the guards.  It gave me control. I got to a gun and I took my chance.  Ive never told anyone that.
You can drop the act, its over.
He used your exact words.
BondJamesBond. What brings you here?
Bond, Im a civilian. This is my place. Used to be the royal familys, now its mine. I run my little business, I stay out of trouble...
Shes no innocent.  This is my nuclear consultant.
The right kind of explosion in the right spot -- it would block the Bosphorus, cut off the Black Sea.
What class sub does your nephew run?
Could...could you come?
Your father...
Of course...
What do you think?
No.  It is the beginning. The world will never be the same.
And expensive.  Cost three million plus.
I can't tell you that.  It is quite urgent.
What about the aftermath?  This so-called . . . "nuclear winter" theory?
The weather.  I see.  Keep me posted.  I want hourly forecasts and a full report on optimum strike conditions.
You oughta see upstairs.  It's a slaughterhouse.
Saw the world that night -- random, empty, hideous.  God didn't make it that way.  We did.  We make the world -- in our own image.  What else can I illuminate?
Mm hmm.
Jon, no -- I can't --
Yes.  In about . . . thirty seconds, for example, you'll tell me you're sleeping with Dreiberg.
Then you're sleeping with Dreiberg?
Because --
I don't know yet.  I should be able to tell you in -- roughly six hundred years.
You're the only human being I care for.
My God.  Murdered?  -- What's this have to do with Rorschach?
You did the right thing, Daniel.  Let's stay in touch, okay?  Good night.
Good Lord.  How'd you get it on tape?
Adrian -- you've lost it.
And what if youre wrong?
Oh yeah.  The one that used to confess to everything?  Hoping we'd beat him up?
Sure.  It works.  I mean, look at this face, Daniel.  I'm thirty-eight years old!
-- I thought it was time for a routine maintenance check.
Antarctica??
I think he's going to the john.
Will you two lovebirds keep it down?
Those cars.  What year is this??
Wherever we are, it's better than what we left.  Backs together --
Did anybody follow you?  See you come here?
Toilet clogged.  Short fat turd.  Let's get out of here.
Are you saying that someone would risk starting World War III just to get back at us?  What about all those poor shits with cancer?
Come on, Rorschach.  Gimme a break --
Veidt's assassin.  Leads to follow.  Can't just --
Adrian.  Its too late.  The world is blowing up as we stand here.
Jon Osterman, you don't act like a Princeton boy.  What's a big lug like you doing in a place like this?
We should get back --  What?
Janey, will you marry me?
Did you know he was back on the streets?
I don't know their real names.
What are you saying?  That Jon is radioactive?
What does this mean?  What does it --
That's it.  This is all a trick, isn't it?  Some kind of horrible joke to make me --
Stay, Adrian.  I just -- every once in a while, I need to talk to someone human.  He doesn't think like we do.  He doesn't even feel what we feel.  I mean -- he even scares the research teams.
ALL RIGHT!  ALL RIGHT!!  -- How'd you find me?
Before you do that, you might want to look at what I've been looking at.
Look at me, dude, do I look like a fan of law enforcement? Forget the tests, you shoulda just asked me. I woulda saved you a lot of trouble.
Are we done now? You've got nothing on me. So if you ain't booking me, I'm walking.
You want the cheap backstory? The runaway mom, the suicide dad and the foster homes? Gimme a break. You're not interested in my past, you're interested in my future as some kind of spy.
Wherever you go on the planet, I'll find you. There's no quitting. If you try to take it off, a ring of needles will inject enough curare into your bloodstream to kill you before you hit the ground. Is all that clear?
If you're trying to push my buttons, you're on the right track. Don't make me question my own judgment, X.
Yes it does.
I'm pretty happy to see me too. So are you done with me yet?
No needles, huh? What about the acid bath?
We're gonna have to step in, Sam. Those CIA boys couldn't find a clown in a field of cactus. Let me take care of it.
That's exactly why we need them.
If it means getting Silent Night back, absolutely.
What weapons do you have?
Oh. I bet by the end he gets something out of it.
Why are you still hanging around? Your business is finished, you should go home.
I don't know who you are or where you come from, but I don't like you. You ask too many questions.
We hung out last night, remember?
Not an option. Just get up slowly like everything's cool. Petra, trust me. You just hung yourself out to dry for me, I'm not gonna let you down.
No, something worse. He says it's a surprise, but I know him. This is his masterpiece.
There's something I didn't have time to tell you before.
I don't know. Eight months ago I stop hearing from my people. No explanation, just silence. So I stay and I wait like I was told. Soon I'm in so far, they'd kill me if I left. Now every day I get farther and farther away from what I was. I'm like you said, a criminal.
Why? You're the one who believes in nothing. Screw the world, or whatever you said.
Aren't they gonna wonder were you've been?
It's about your next mission. You need to be debriefed.
Why don't we go below decks and work off some of this adrenaline.
I thought that was in detail.
You run around with maniacs jumping motorcycles in the desert, you break 36 bones crashing wave runners and snowboarding off cliffs, all with no health insurance... It's insane, I can't take it anymore.
Is this what you're looking for?
A parachute. This does not argue well.
This pizda? Never seen him before.
He flashed his badge to half the bar when he bought his drink.
You wanna see my politics?
So where do you think he's planning this larger demonstration?
What's that?
It's too far.
You know, you --
Sure you are, sport.
What if I like the pain?
What if they're naughty?
Suit yourself.
Math.  History.  Science.  English. Athletics --
Control, Senator...  we teach them control.
Senator?
I can assure you, there is no such creature in my genes.
What do you want?
They're all asking how you're doing. Are you feeling up to saying hello to everyone?
A piece.  Only a piece.
Not at the cost of lives, Max.
Still trying to make the world safe for our kind.  Still trying to find a way to introduce ourselves -- definitively.
Herr Falkstein -- you must go at once and present Dr. Frankenstein with all the details of his inheritance.  The estate will provide for your journey.
Now wait a minute!
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir?
I did, sir.
Was he aware of the importance of this occasion?
Is it that music?
Well... yes.
I...
Of course.
I promise.
Whatever makes you happy.
No, of course not.  I just meant...
Yes, but... I thought, perhaps tonight, under the circumstances, I might... stay here with you.
Does that include the key to the laboratory?
Fron kon steen!
Break that old man's violin.
The old violinist -- you smashed his violin over your knee.
Yes, sir.
A piece of what?
Are you speaking of the worm, or ... the spaghetti.
Nineteen!  My dear young man... once the human organism has ceased to function, nature has deemed that creature to be dead.
No, Fred ereck.
It's not.  It's Fredereck Fronkonsteen.
You must be Igor.
You were sent by Herr Falkstein, weren't you?
I beg your pardon?
I got frightened all alone upstairs, so I came down here.
What?
No, but when I first came in, there was a light coming from behind that steel door.
'How I Did It.'  Good title!
Could be worse!
I have a pretty good idea.
He only died two weeks ago -- I'm sure they'll still have him. Hurry now.  I'll prepare the body.
If you like -- just hurry!
Yes!  It's all written down in the notes.  Tie off the kites and come down!
It wasn't me.
I suppose you're right.  Inga! Prepare a sedative, just in case.
... I'm glad that's...
That's what we're paid for.
Come on, Froderick -- none of that.
That sound good, boss.
... It's.
Zis is an old Transylvanian Lullaby.
It's an honor for me, sir.  You play the violin?
Yes, you may... but don't make any noise.
Yes!  What could it be at this hour?
All right then, quietly!  Close your robe and stay right behind me. Don't make a sound!
Well, this explains the music.
Perhaps we'd better leave.
Oh, Frederick... you're not only a great doctor, you're a great... you're almost a...
Yes!
I thought it was wonderful.
You've got to help me to remain faithful.
You can't expect to iron out all the kinks in one night.
Yes.
Food!
Franz!  Help!  Lunatic!
So, you got it in the line of dooty.. ... point taken.
I have received intelligence from, sources of my own that the Zulu Impis are moving North of here and threaten your left.
And the threat of counter invasion no longer exists? 40
But will they make good use of them?
A large party of Zulus have been sighted in the direction of the King's KraaL Getting up, CHELMSFORD moves over to look at the map on his desk.
Um. There are rumours that my Lord Chelmsford intends to make Durnford Second in Command.
Keep steady. You're the best shots of the Twenty-Fourth. You bunch of heathens, do it
I think Chelmsford wants a good man on the border Why he fears a flanking attack and requires a steady Commander in reserve.
