How do you get your hair to look like that?
I looked for you back at the party, but you always seemed to be "occupied".
Then Guillermo says, "If you go any lighter, you're gonna look like an extra on 90210."
The "real you".
I'm kidding.  You know how sometimes you just become this "persona"?  And you don't know how to quit?
She okay?
They do to!
I have to be home in twenty minutes.
You think you ' re the only sophomore at the prom?
Exactly  So, you going to Bogey Lowenbrau's thing on Saturday?
So yeah, I've got the Sears catalog thing going -- and the tube sock gig " that's gonna be huge.  And then I'm up for an ad for Queen Harry next week.
Neat...
I have the potential to smack the crap out of you if you don't get out of my way.
Can't you forget for just one night that you're completely wretched?
I don't get you.  You act like you're too good for any of this, and then you go totally apeshit when you get here.
Let go!
Now don't get upset. Daddy, but there's this boy... and I think he might ask...
Wear the belly before you go.
He's not a "hot rod".  Whatever that is.
So -- which Dakota you from?
How many people were in your old school?
He always have that shit-eating grin?
Guess who just signed up for a tutor?
You know, if you do go out with Bianca, you'd be set.  You'd outrank everyone. Strictly A-list.  With me by your side.
You told me that part already.
Okay -- Likes:  Thai food, feminist prose, and "angry, stinky girl music of the indie-rock persuasion".
What'd you do to her?
Hey -- do you mind?
I can't date her sister until that one gets a boyfriend.  And that's the catch. She doesn't want a boyfriend.
I just upped my price
A hundred bucks a date.
It's about time.
I don't know, Dorsey. ..the limo.-the flowers.  Another hundred for the tux --
But she can't go out with you because her sister is this insane head case and no one will go out with her. right?
You better not fuck this up.  I'm heavily invested.
I appreciate your efforts toward a speedy death, but I'm consuming.  Do you mind?
You think this'll work?
What'd he say?
You didn't
You ' re looking at this from the wrong perspective.  We're making a statement.
William - he asked me to meet him here.
There's a way to get a guy's attention.
You hate me don't you?
Then say you'll spend Dollar Night at the track with me.
You're not a big talker, are you?
You know, these guys are no Bikini Kill or The Raincoats, but they're right up there.
Uh, uh. You lie down and you'll go to sleep
Why?
Like you could find one
Who?
Excuse me, have you seen The Feminine Mystique?  I lost my copy.
So what did I have an effect on ?
Good call.
So what's your excuse?
State trooper?
Tell me something true.
What?
No, I won't go with you
How'd you get a tux at the last minute?
Why is my veggie burger the only burnt object on this grill?
I know.
I don't understand the allure of dehydrated food.  Is this something I should be hip to?
Which parts?
Am I supposed to feel better? Like, right now?  Or do I have some time to think about it?
Cool pictures.  You a fan?
Kat a fan, too?
I think I speak correctly when I say that Cameron's love is pure.  Purer than say -- Joey Dorsey's.
I don't understand, Patrick.  You haven't done anything asinine this week. Are you not feeling well?
In the microwave.
Would you rather be ravished by a pirate or a British rear admiral?
They'll dance, they'll kiss, they'll come home.  Let her go.
Have a great time, honey!
Did I have anything to say about it?
If God intended our proximity to Asia, do you believe he would have waited for you to show it to the world?
Asia can be found to the west -- and I will prove it.
The State has some reason to be interested in this man's proposition, Your Eminence...
He is a mercenary!  Did he not already try to convince the King of Portugal of his absurd notions?
She said yes.
Can't you stay with us a little?
May I ask by whom?
My letters of appointment.
How could I be?  The mainland has been found.  Exactly as I said it would.
What does he say?
Say not here!  Cuba!
You come!  You speak first!
Chief says -- how many?
Diego is a bright boy -- a pleasure to teach -- but so serious... Brothers should be raised together, Colon.  Even brothers from different mothers...
How did you manage it?
You get so carried away when you are being contradicted!
If God intends you to go, then you will go.
Colon!
How long?
My son, my son...  Your certitudes are sometimes frightening...  Christopher, you must speak to them. And if you don't I will.
I suppose we're both old men now.
New worlds create new people.
May I speak freely?
I know what I see.  I see someone who doesn't accept the world as it is.  Who's not afraid.  I see a women who thinks... "What if?"...
How old are you, Senor Colon?
We lost cousins, friends.  We will wash this in blood.
In one act of brutality, you have created chaos.  Tribes who were fighting each other are now joining forces against us!  All that because of your criminal savagery!
Where can I meet this man?
You must be mad...!
You bloody...
Is that the man I knew, Treasurer Sanchez?
... But there is worse.  He ordered the execution of five members of the nobility...
Don't say anything.
I brought you some letters.  It's really fan mail.  Women mostly.  One wants to buy you clothes, another sent a check. Another wants a check.
Well, you didn't appreciate the severity of it until recently.  No question about that.
I would say...half.  Half is fair.
That's what he did to me.  He put cigarettes out on me.
You considered becoming a prostitute?
I came here.  I had no money.  I knew no one.  I couldn't get a job because you have to have a green card to get work. They approached me - I could've made a lot of money.  I considered it, but... it's not who I am.  They pay me below the table at Ludwig's.
You don't know.  I'm sorry.  I was desperate.  That's not me.  I shot a cop.  Can you imagine what they'll do to me when I got to prison?
I told your partner, I can't help.  I didn't see anything.
Tamina was a friend of mine.  My shower was broken, she let me use theirs.
Ladder 20 was on the Rock for training. We stopped there... so she could get cleaned up.
The public doesn't have any idea what we do and now you're going to define our image!  This is going to be our Rodney King!
Alright.  Swing by her apartment.  Let her pick up her clothes and take her straight to Hoover Street.  You got that?
I'm gonna propose.
Tomorrow.  At lunch.
Only one guys checked in?
What's wrong?
Boy, she's so popular all the sudden.
The Super said he'd seen her before but she didn't live here.
You thirsty?
Yeah.
So...who's Nicky?
So tabloids don't have to do re enactments.  They going to have real movie this time.
You really think you'll be able to fool a jury with this bullshit?  How fuckin' stupid are you?
Detective - can you tell us what happened here?
Okay.  But I do understand that your partner, Leon Jackson's been injured. Is that correct?
Alright.
That was good.  You were holding the evidence.
You promise?
How old are your kids?
I hope this prick doesn't run.  My knees are killing me.  Stay behind me.
Okay.  You work in a vodka factory.  I understand that.  And what kind of work do you do?
And what do you do with the bones?
It's an outcall service run out of an apartment.  I don't meet the other girls.  Aren't you gonna get undressed?
How much money are you carrying with you?
Two weeks.
In here, says he wants a million.
Don't fool around.
Why?  Why do I always have to speak to you in Czech?
How you erase this?
Whore?
Get in the bathroom!
I did.
This is my project.  I say 'action.'  I am the director!  You are the talent. You wait for me to say 'action.'  And 'action!'
I'm serious...this - this is a great American film.  Full of violence and sex.  And I want my credit.
Your sister said she didn't know where you were so you shouldn't write to her with return address if you're hiding.
Yes, the money is good.
Robert...?
I speak English.
I'm here for movies.
And while they're burning up, they're still goin' down on each other?  You got to hand it to them.
What was that?
I'll take him.
Okay, you're under arrest!  Now you happy?
Yeah?  What kind?
Mouth's clean, too.
You see Eddie's face when I gave him the timer?  Wish I had a picture of it.
-- From Czechoslovakia?  And how long have they been livin' in your building?  Alright, I'll be in touch when we know somethin'.  Milos and Tamina Karlova.  They were quiet and kept to themselves.  Landlord don't know who your girl is.
How was it?
It was my finger that pulled the trigger, but I'm not morally responsible.  My psychiatrist knew what I was capable of.  How could I know. I'm not a doctor.
We're in negotiations, that's correct.
CONTINUED
Okay. 
Really.
Not really. They just said it might be because we trained at Houston and they trained in Marshall, and that we're being charged against differ- ent accounting offices.
Well, what do you think we ought to do about it?
Yes, I thought so.
I know. It would be almost inconceivable.
I suppose computers have been known to be wrong.
Hal?
It's the last one.
I didn't do that Frank. I took particular care not to freeze them.
I guess not.
I suppose it's because you've been under a lot of stress, but have you forgotten that they're not supposed to be revived for another three months.
I can tell from the tone of your voice, Dave, that you're upset. Why don't you take a stress pill and get some rest.
CONTINUED

I'm having a party tomorrow.
Are you coming to my party?
One, two, three. Can I speak to Mommy?
I'll wish you a happy Birthday now and I'll see you soon. All right, Darling?
'Bye, 'bye, now, sweetheart.
Well, thank you very much for being so understanding.
Really?
But you don't have any idea as to what it is?
That's true.
That's true.
I understand.
Roger.
Pod Bay is decompressed. All doors are secure. You are free to open pod bay doors.
Do you have any idea of what is causing this fault?
Name?
That we do. And we put air in the tires. I'll even sell you some gas if you need it.
Now how's your memory doin'?
Maybe after we get done with him I'm gonna buy us some girls.
Maybe that's where I'm gonna cut your throat.
Hey, what kind of talk is that?
I hear you've got visitors.
You and the other one, you're still Billy's girls. You always were his girls...
I don't need to hear your jive. I already got that department taken care of...
Hey, no way.  Take off the bracelets or no deal.
No way to start a partnership.
Okay, let's get down to it.  I did my part and got you out.  So now you tell me where we're goin'?
I can read a police file, shithead, and quit calling me Jack.
Just up the street, the other side, over there ... Now, don't bother knockin' on the door. Luther ain't the kind of guy that looks for company.
Who'd you call on the phone back at the booking station?
Hey, you wanna bet?
I'll tell you what happens if you lose... you tell the truth for once.
You tell me what Ganz busted out for, he's after a lot more than just gettin' out of jail.  And whatever it is, you're part of it.
This place don't seem real popular with the brothers.
Yeah, right.  You want to try again?
Half a million.
We split 50-50?
Where's the money?
I suppose you'd never be like Luther and let a woman get to you...
Doesn't it get... Tiring?
That was in style a couple years back, man.
What about Luther?
Yeah, I see her.
Notice something funny about that bus?
Hey, how'd my car get here?
It's late, they're closing...
Hey, there she is...
If we run into Billy first, let me try and talk him in.
Yeah, and I know Ganz sure ain't no sweetheart... I wouldn't like it if this partnership ended before it gets started.
You okay?
How did they get away?
Don't duck the bullet Cates. Why didn't you call in for backup instead of makin' a grandstand play?
But that's what you say about all of us all the tine ... we're always the ones fucking up when you tell it...
Billy Bear...
Wait a minute, wait a minute... who's this?
You look awful.
Jesus Christ.  Why the hell didn't you tell me before?
Ganz and Billy got my girl, Rosalie.
He ... he wants me to help him skip town.
Irrigated his face with the shot of J and B I'd just poured him. Then I tried to deck the sucker.
Here it comes again ... the sacred job...
I'm at work, asshole.  Where else?
The number ... what's the Goddamn number?
How do you know?
How'd they take it back at headquarters?
What do you want?  What's goin' on?
We got a lot to talk about.
Surprise, Luther.
Let her go.
You want to go outside?
...We're saved!
Why?  What's wrong with me?
Father, by creating a little destruction, I am, in fact, encouraging life!  So, in reality, you and I are in the same business!
You are a monster, Zorg!
Excuse me, I'm looking for a priest.
There's not a moment to lose! Wake her up, but be gentle about it!  This woman is mankind's most precious possession! She is... perfect!
Thank you so much for your help Mr...?
Of course.
What are you doing?
Don't tell me you don't know how all this works?
And you don't know how they open, is that what you are saying?
We have forty-eight hours, the time it needs to adapt itself to our living conditions.
Is there anything that can stop it?
Father.  You sure she's the Supreme Being?
They really made her...
I got it!  Everything  here we need to know about Fhloston Paradise Hotel... and a detailed blueprint of the entire hotel!
Where's Leeloo?
You're all safe. Thanks be to God!
Finger..man..I'm sorry..listen..I was on the way over but I had a fare fall into my lap.. y'know one of those big fares you just can't resist..
Akina delutan, nou-shan.
Daya deo dono Dato.  Dalutan!
Hey,  that's... cute... Do you have a nickname, something a little... shorter?
...Hello?
Other than that... You all right?
I'm coming!. Ma, what're you talking about?
...Ma???
30 seconds...
...Quiver ladies, he's gonna set the world on fire right here from 5 to 7! You'll know everything there is to know about the D-man. His dreams, his desires, his most intimate of intimates.  And from what I'm looking at intimate is the stud muffin's middle name. So tell me my main man... you nervous in the service?
I didn't come here to play Dumbo on the radio. So tomorrow between 5 and 7 give yourself a hand, that clear pal?
You don't do what I say... I'll waste you myself. Got it?
I'm not going.
...Shit!
Valo massa... Chacha hamas.
Dinoine chagantakat!
Apipoulai!
Love...
Finished what?
Apipoussan?
You noticed..
You're nothing but a... a...
Five hundred wars... Arms... Drugs... Money... Everything you create is used to destroy...
Leeloo? The Stones! We have to open them! How does it work?
It's up to you now, Angel!
Not going to open?
This is all that survived?
Talk English Doc.
...This is the crucial phase, The reconstruction of pigment. Cells are bombarded with slightly greasy solar atoms which forces the body cells to react, to protect themselves. That means growing skin. Clever, eh?
Staedert?  What's going on?  Did you destroy it?
Lord forgive me.. they already know too, much..
Drink!
Do you have the picture now Mr. Zorg?
Okay, I believe you.
Amy, just listen.  Take Cindy and get out of the house.  Do it now. Go to a hotel and stay there...
Look where we are.  Look at yourself.  You son of a bitch, you don't have any idea what you're putting me through...
What was I supposed to think happened to you?!
Snuff?
Blow me, you paranoid fuck, that's impossible.  Why are you bothering me with this... ?
It's an honor to meet you.  Thank you for seeing us.
A fellow investor.
I want to watch you work.
Mister Welles... would you be so kind as to remove any firearms from your person?
You remember Mr. Longdale, don't you?
What can I do for you, Mr. Welles?
Few days ago, I was contacted by a couple living in Philadelphia, a doctor and his wife.  What happened was they picked up a young girl hitchhiking off 81, which heads into Philadelphia, started up a conversation with this girl, she looked homeless, seemed about eighteen maybe.  They convinced her to let them buy her a meal in the city.  Nice kid, mature, didn't have much to say, but they got a sense she's a runaway, so all through dinner the doctor's working on her, trying to convince her that at the very least she should pick up a telephone.  Not surprisingly, she ate her food, excused herself...  That's the last they saw her.  The reason they came to me for help, the reason I'm coming to you, is we had a friend of mine in the department work up a sketch...  They want to see if I can I.D. this girl, somehow pass along a message to let the parents know the kid's alive, doing alright.
For whatever reasons I thought you might be more receptive.
This doctor and wife, they're nice people, but they don't want to get too involved.  They're not trying to have the parents come looking for the girl either. You and I both know sometimes, not often, but sometimes there's real reasons why a kid'll run. Molestation, whatever.  Besides that, the girl's probably eighteen, so she's legal.
Files are mostly by state and year of disappearance.  We try to keep the children and adults separate. No eating or smoking in here, but there's a coffee machine in the hall.
It's horrible, but it'll be your best friend after a few days.  I hope you realize what kind of long shot you're chasing after.
Yeah, who's this?
What the fuck are you.. ?
What did you do, knock her out, shoot her up... ?
You got absolute zero.
Look, you cocksucker...
You were the middleman, am I right? Old man Christian wasn't about to go shopping for a snuff film himself.
So, he sent you, gave you the money, his errand-boy.  And if you refused, it wasn't like you could tell anyone your pervert boss just asked you to get him a snuff film.  That's the beauty of lawyer/client privilege.
Must have paid you a lot, for you to risk everything.  Would've had to have cut yourself a real nice piece of money.
That's why you got scared when Mrs. Christian hired me.  You knew about the film, figured it had to be in that safe.  How'd you find me?
Mary Anne Mathews was alive till you paid money to have her murdered.
You're asking me why?
A man like Mr. Christian, a great man... all his money, all his power... a man who attained everything there was to attain...
Give me the film.
It's your call, but you're gonna be sorry when you're in one of those everyday situations that call for a battery-operated vagina and you don't have one.
You've got Penthouse, Playboy, Hustler, etc.  Nobody even considers them pornography anymore.  Then, there's mainstream hardcore.  Triple X.  The difference is penetration. That's hardcore.  That whole industry's up in the valley. Writers, directors, porn stars. They're celebrities, or they think they are.  They pump out 150 videos a week.  A week.  They've even got a porno Academy Awards.  America loves pornography.  Anybody tells you they never use pornography, they're lying.  Somebody's buying those videos.  Somebody's out there spending 900 million dollars a year on phone sex.  Know what else?  It's only gonna get worse.  More and more you'll see perverse hardcore coming into the mainstream, because that's evolution.  Desensitization.  Oh my God, Elvis Presley's wiggling his hips, how offensive!  Nowadays, Mtv's showing girls dancing around in thong bikinis with their asses hanging out.  Know what I mean?  For the porn-addict, big tits aren't big enough after a while.  They have to be the biggest tits ever.  Some porn chicks are putting in breast implants bigger than your head, literally.  Soon, Playboy is gonna be Penthouse, Penthouse'll be Hustler, Hustler'll be hardcore, and hardcore films'll be medical films. People'll be jerking off to women laying around with open wounds. There's nowhere else for it to go.
What you saw tonight, we're not talking about a video some dentist takes home over the weekend.  We're talking about stuff where people get hurt.  Specialty product.
There's two kinds of specialty product; legal and illegal.  Foot fetish, shit films, watersports, bondage, spanking, fisting, she- males, hemaphrodites... it's beyond hardcore, but legal.  This is the kind of hardcore where one guy's going to look at it and throw up, another guy looks at it and falls in love.  Now, with some of the S+M and bondage films, they straddle the line.  How are you supposed to tell if the person tied up with the ball gag in their mouth is a consenting or not?  Step over that line, you're into kiddie porn.  Rape films, but there aren't many.  I've never seen one.
Take a vacation.  I'll pay you four hundred a day, plus expenses.
You didn't say it was gonna be this luxurious.
Wha... ?
Have a pleasant evening.  Will you have tea, Mister Welles?
I've spoken to friends of mine and my husband's, in Harrisburg, in Lancaster and Hershey.  Asking about you.  I must say you have friends in influential places.
As you know, my husband passed away recently.  Two weeks ago now.
Pittsburgh?
My husband was the only one with the combination to this safe.  I knew about it, but as far as I was concerned it was none of my business.  Not till now, that is.
You don't have any other choice.
Nothing remotely like this.
I've been ordered into bed.  The doctor says I've gotten the flu, or some other wretched ailment.
You have to forgive me, but in these circumstances... with your daughter...  Were there any indications of... any sort of abuse?
I... I shouldn't take anymore of your time.  Maybe we can finish tomorrow.  I'll call tomorrow...
How... how can you say that to me...?
My husband never laid a hand on her. She would have told me... she would have told me...
Hello... ?
I remember.  You just left...
Mrs. Mathews, your daughter is dead. She's dead.
Her belongings?
Your son-in-law dealt with the dry cleaning franchise during the day, saw that woman every night.  The specifics are in the report, and information about the woman.  It's unpleasant, I know.  I apologize...
No, sir, he is not.
Okay, I'll take it all.
The mirror.  You can't see yourself in it.
You alright?
You what?
No...
Rick stayed later after school with Kristen.  She wasn't feeling very well.
Alright, let's assume this whole thing is true. Why does Freddy all of a sudden need you?
You don't really get it.  He's not a nightstalker.  It'll take more than bench presses to beat him.
He's going after Debbie, I gotta stop him.
What is it?
Feeling better now?
Frankly, dear, we wondered what you intend to do with our baby?
We know you've been through a lot but there's more than your feelings at stake here.
What do you mean?
But how...?
Hi, beautiful.
I was afraid you weren't coming.
Thanks for everything, Dad.
How was the meeting?
You disappointed in me?
Good to see you again, Mr. Grey.  I've got to go find Dan.
What's that got to do with it?
I don't understand what's happening. Krueger has to use my dreams, but he got to Dan and Greta while I was awake. How's he doing it?
I really think you need to calm down now, okay?
Look...we're all tired.  None of us had any sleep since Friday night...
You think that's the place she's buried?
You do good work, Alice.
He sure loves to stay awake.
Mark, are you okay?
Do you think I'm an idiot...for being in love with her?
Where are you going?
They think I'm nuts.
That club sucks, they card everybody. Let's just party at your place.
Stop saying that, it's bullshit.
Dan.  And he's taking Alice with him -- pretty good dive Yvonne.  You've been practicing.
Vomit?
I should have suspectcd, when I heard that 'Doctor.'  I thought it was your father.
How is he - ?
Wearing a uniform doesn't bestow an automatic monopoly on courage, <u>Commander</u>!  It just so happens I'm <u>not</u> a coward - physical or mental - and before I'd risk my father's life...
Perhaps.  But the idea of willingly going to <u>school</u> to spend my <u>life</u> at a Paleozoic pastime that should have disappeared with the thunder-lizards - I'm referring to War - <u>that</u> strikes me as the <u>worst</u> cowardice of all - being spiritually yellow!
I guess Skipper Neilsen re- tired before you enrolled at the Academy, didn't he?
Cyclops?
We're stuck tight!
I think you're right.
We read you!  Go ahead, Doctor!  They're inside the saucer.  It's filled with breathable air!
Excuse me, Captain - there may be one last, desperate chance - a one-in-a-thousand shot...
As we near the Pole...
I'm - afraid I have some bad news for you, Reef -  You'll have to share quarters, this trip.
Why?
Due north.  At five knots...no, six!
You got yourself a computer, Alma.
Well, you look... sad. Upset. I don't mean to pry. I'm sorry about your mother. It was a nice funeral.
Who?
No.
LaRiviere says he ain't gonna pay for the fixin' of your car. A couple hundred for the clutch. I got some more bad news. Wanna hear it?
I plan to. Soon.
It looks pretty hopeless, don't it?
Might as well take the rest of the day off. You look sort of fucked up. You've been paid for the day, anyhow, right?
Guaranteed, eh?
Done much shooting with that rifle yet?
If you get it?
You might not kill it.
I'm okay.
This way.
No brag. Just fact.
Don't know about lucky. The guy's a full-blown asshole. Pay's good, though. $100 a day. I got to guarantee a kill, of course. Which I can do. There's some monster bucks hiding out up there.
Like you and Gordon?
You bring him up yourself? That's a steep climb.
You stayed away?
On your sleeve.
I gotta make a report to Fish and Game. I was just wondering, that's all. What'd he do, to shoot himself, I mean?
You know.
But it's not funny now.
Jesus. Listen, Jill, tell you what. Tomorrow morning, you still want to go home, I'll drive you down. I'll get off work or something.
What? You called Mommy? Just now?
Come and get you! Shit! It's a damn half hour drive each way. Why didn't you talk to me about it first?
Yeah. Yeah, right, I'm mad. What'd you tell her, for Christ sake?
Are we going in this?
Pop?
Nothing, I guess. I guess I can wait till we get home. Maybe we'll stop by Wickham's for a hamburger when we get to Lawford. That suit you? You always like Wickham's.
You're a policeman.
We're looking for the funniest costume! And the scariest! And the most imaginative! And the best costume of all!
Huh?
Don't go playing policeman.
Fuck. You don't know how bad or anything?
That must've been Twombley. Jesus. I bet that was Twombley.
Something bugging you?
On what you pay me?
You? Why?
It's just...
No problem. Look, I...
Low as what? What have I done? It's bad to want to see your own daughter?
Did you get his number?
I still don't understand --
I'm sorry.
No you don't. You're pissed, that's all. You ought to cool off for a few days then have a long talk with Lillian. You know? Work it out with her, tell her how you feel. Lillian's not out to get you.
Jack's sort of sensitive, I guess. More than most. But he'll be okay in a few weeks.
...Jack's turned into one of those men who are permanently angry. He used to be a sweet kid, but it's like, when he found out he couldn't play ball anymore, he changed. Now he's like everyone else.
Lots of people. Guy like Evan Twombley, Boston union official, probably got lots of people want to see him dead. The Government's been investigating his links with the Mafia.
I can see what you looked like as a kid.
Yeah, but never what you looked like. Not really. Never really studied your face, like now. I was never able to see you as a kid when you were a kid until now, this way.
After making love. I like it. It's nice to see that in a grown-up person.
Then... I guess you have to.
Whitehouse. Next time, phone ahead.
You talked to Jack?
Jillie, you want a cheese grilled sandwich?
Rolfe.
Yeah.
You! By Christ, you -- I know you.  Yeah, you goddamn sonofabitch, I know you. You're a goddamn fucking piece of my heart!
Yeah, brother, look, I was calling cause -- has there been anything on TV in Boston about a hunting accident with a guy named Twombley, Evan Twombley?
It'll come out Jack lied and the kid'll get hung for it.
Lillian was here. In Lawford.
Pointless to stand around in church with nothing to do, I guess.
Well, do you still plan to get married?
Which is?
Then who shot him?
Yeah, the guy with the BMW I told you about. I did, didn't I?
I hate to disappoint you, but I don't think it happened.
Then you accidentally see your body, or your face, or whatever, and you don't know who the hell it belongs to. Strange. It's the business with the old man, I know, and how incredibly pissed I was at him, and also chasing Jack Hewitt like that, and the Goddamned truck going through the ice, not to mention Margie's being so upset -- one thing on top of another.
When I write my memoirs I think I'll devote an entire chapter to the cocoa aboard Air Force One.
Mom?
The woman you shot. She was my friend.
How was...  ...the ballet?
Alice!
How you doing, sweetie?
It's some kind of trick... a preliminary airstrike in response to our troop movement.
It's cut.
Mr. President, it's an honor. Now with your permission can we lead you the fuck out of here.
Put your pilot on.
Two and three are heading toward the Boeing.
Walter, if you have a point, make it.
Sir, you threw out page two.
You're duty to what? The country you served doesn't exist anymore.
Air Force One, please reduce speed to 250 knots.
Romeo Tango Zulu, do you have the President? Over.
And all these rooms here?
*                     Please tell me your name.
Nor will there be. My husband does not negotiate with terrorists.
You got what you wanted. You going to release us now?
She isn't a part of this. This is between you and me.
No you won't. You'll compromise... like always.
Mr. Caidwell, the ground's a few miles away. How do you propose getting us from here to there?
Get `em ready.  You... come with me.
Sir, we stay with the President.
You know what?
Look on the bright side, hon. Shep here thinks I'll be a one termer.
I don't know why you stayed.
What's going on?
One.
Thank you for calling the white House...
Iraq, sir. We're over Iraq.
That's right, Commissioner.  Senselessly murdered just minutes ago.
Forget it.  I was reading.
What's the story?
Oveur.
Dunn.
Elaine.
Ted!  What are you...?
I've never used the word insane, Ted.
The word is sick.  Ted -- very, very, very sick.
Elaine!
What will happen to him, Ted?
Are you afraid?
Ted, the lever!
Ted seemed to get worse after I told him about Simon, Doctor.
Intermitant failure in scan mode "R". Analyze.
Elaine, I'm sorry about that little outburst a moment ago.
Request; life support systems check.
I sure an glad they let Scraps ride up here with us.
How many kids get a chance to live on another planet.
Okay, Joey.  The Doc says you gotta relax. This hospital in Des Moines is the best sex clinic in the country.
Captain, the coffee machine is jammed and I don't like it.
Captain Oveur?
I have to see Bud Kruger.
You can't go in there!
Striker.
You don't have to thank me, I'm a nurse. This is my father, Dr. Barrington.
Then the relationship remains the same and the love changes only when there's change in the two people who share that love.
Ah, won't you sit down?
You know, here we are having coffee together, and discussing education and business and economy...and we don't even know each other's names...full names I mean.
I'm sure we'll both make it...but just in case one of us...well, is there a message you'd like me to give someone?
Yeah, something like that, but as I say, they didn't have time to tell me very much.
I won't deceive you, Mister Striker. We're running out of time.
George Zipp said that?
You can't take a guess for another two hours?
What is it, Doctor? What's happening?
Don't you feel anything for me at all any more?
Rain.
It's a damn good thing he doesn't know how much I hate his guts.
See them, Elaine?
We'd better get back now.
Hey, we've been waiting for you. A little bit late tonight.
Oh, Bill, I'm going to miss you so much.
So long, darling. Good-bye. Take care of yourself.
And get that finger out of your ear. You don't know where that finger's been! Gunderson?
You <u>are</u> Kareem. I've seen you play. My Dad's got season tickets!
Denver Control, this is Flight two-zero- niner intersecting Victor Airway seven- niner-niner.
Roger.
We have clearance, Clarence.
Excuse me, Sister?
Do you feel all right, sir?
Excuse me, sir. There's been a little problem in the cockpit and I was wondering...
Look, I don't know where Mr. Strader might be.  He comes and he goes.
I know... Why don't you hang around for a while, let me entertain you? It's Matt, right?  Now tell me the truth, have you ever... made it... with one of us?
We are with the Police Department. This is Sergeant Sykes, and I am--
In there.
What's this?  What's going on?
Rudyard Kipling?  No shit?  Listen, we just need a minute of your time...
Who said that?
Screw you.
Your home is quite disordered.  I thought perhaps you had been burglarized when I walked in.
She's going to divorce me.
How potent?
Uh, George...
George, c'mon -- lighten up.  It's a beauty of a case.  Don't sweat it -- we got him by the short hairs. He ain't gonna make any more of the shit.
With Harcourt and Kipling dead, I assume you will be requesting reassignment now.
Harcourt is dead.
Why the hell are you so dead set against back-up?
But there's no more drug.
Yeah, the shells are too big for six in an cylinder.  Hell, Matt, you don't need but one.
Jesus, are the questions too tough for you already?  Let's try again--  Is your name Porter?
You took this gut out, too, didn't you?
Yeah, Sykes?
What?
Goddammit, Tug -- I want to see Kristin get married, okay?  But--
Does that look at all suspicious to you?
Movement!
First squad up, on line.  Hicks, get yours in a cordon.  Watch the rear.
I've isolated a neuro-muscular toxin responsible for the paralysis.  It seems to be metabolizing.  He should wake up soon.
But these things come from eggs...so where are all the eggs coming from.
I get the picture.
You had them eating out of your hand, kiddo.
I hope you're right.  I really do.
I expected more of you, Ripley. I thought you would be smarter than this.
Looks like you company can write off its share of this colony.
I told them to fall back...
Yes, Hicks?
Let's get the fuck out of here!
Well that's great!  That's just fucking great, man.  Now what the fuck are we supposed to do, man? We're in some real pretty shit now!
The corner!  Ready?
Removed surgically before embryo implantation.  Subject:  Marachuk, John L.   Died during procedure.  They killed him getting it off.
What's this?
You know, Burke, I don't know which species is worse.  You don't see them screwing each other over for a fucking percentage.
Ellen.
Hey, Vasquez...you ever been mistaken for a man?
All right, we can't blow the fuck out of them...why not roll some canisters of CN-20 down there. Nerve gas the whole nest?
Man, we're not going to make it seventeen hours!  Those things are going to come in here, just like they did before, man... they're going to come in here and get us, man, long before...
This signal's weird...must be some interference or something. There's movement all over the place...
You remember you sent some wildcatters out to that plateau, out past the Ilium range, a couple days ago?
There's a guy on the horn, mom-and-pop survey team.  Says he's homing on something and wants to know if his claim will be honored.
Just terrible?  That's better than yesterday at least.
They'd be here if they could, honey.  I know they would.
I was the best at the game. I knew the whole maze.
I don't know, Newt.  That's the truth.
Burke!  Open the door!
What's that?
Oh!
Why?
What did you think of the music?
Oh - excuse me!
No, she's fine.
I'm not surprised. Money seems to be more important to him than loyalty or friendship. He has sold himself to Vienna. Let Vienna look out for him.
Your son is an unprincipled, spoiled, conceited brat.
And how will you make him keep it?
Why what, sir?
If His Grace is not satisfied with me, he can dismiss me.
No, Your Grace! I mean with all humility, no. I would rather you dismissed me. It's obvious I don't satisfy.
Why?
Stop it!
Where?
No, I'm not playing this game.
Iram - marry Em - marry me! No, no! You're a fiend. I'm not going to marry a fiend. A dirty fiend at that.
May I offer you some tea, Herr Mozart?
There's a young girl to see you.
Look, old man, you stay out of this. We spend a fortune on you, more than we can possibly afford, and all you do is criticize, morning to night. And then you think you can -
Salzburg.  We were just talking about Salzburg.  If you've come from my friend the Fartsbishop, you've arrived at just the right moment. Because I've got good news for him. I'm done with Vienna. It's over, finished, done with! Done with! Done with!
Half the receipts! Stanzi!
You're not going to do this?
Why not?
Go back to bed.
I will look at them, of course, the moment I can. It will be an honour. Please give him my warmest.
Really?
Then he didn't send you?
Tomorrow night I dine with the Emperor. One word from me and the post is his.
Come back tonight.
I do apologize for this afternoon. I behaved like a silly girl. Where shall we go?
Well, thank you very much. You can go now.
How much will you pay him?
Where's our friend?
Oh, now I'm a bad housekeeper!
He's adorable!
It's such an honour for us to have you here, Herr Mozart. And for Gertrude.
Really?
A-flat, Majesty.
Oh, Your Majesty, it would be such a tremendous honour!
I'm sure there is a way, Majesty. Some kind of a little contest. I could perhaps put together a small Committee, and I could see to it naturally that it will select according to Your Majesty's wishes.
As a matter of fact, one of my own pupils - a very young singer - told me she was - er - well!
Do you like this, Salieri?
And now he has returned the compliment. Herr Salieri composed that March of Welcome for you.
Majesty!
Yes, where?
It is new, it is, isn't it, Sire?
I don't understand. There are just as many notes, Majesty, as are required. Neither more nor less.
Majesty, may I ask you to do me the greatest favour?
Mozart, are you aware I have declared the French play of Figaro unsuitable for our theatre?
Yet we hear you are making an opera from it. Is this true?
Mozart, I am a tolerant man. I do not censor things lightly. When I do, I have good reason. Figaro is a bad play. It stirs up hatred between the classes. In France it has caused nothing but bitterness. My own dear sister Antoinette writes me that she is beginning to be frightened of her own people. I do not wish to see the same fears starting here.
But, Majesty, this is just a frolic. It's a piece about love.
Ah-ha. What do you say, Chamberlain?
Yes, what about him?
Why not?
Yes, Papa, name it. Name it. I'll do anything you say!
Ah! Here she comes. Fraulein Lorl, good morning.
Oh, thank you, sir.
Now calm yourself. Calm. What's the matter with you?
What medicine?
Where?
Is he working?
Yes?
What?
Are you saying that someone is paying you to be our maid and doesn't want us to know who he is?
Wonderful!  He liked the monkey, didn't you?
Put it down, I said! It's nothing for you.
Herr Mozart. What a surprise. What can I do for you?
Well, this is hardly the way to go about it.
Actually, it's a big secret. Oh, this is delicious! What is it?
I can't say. Really
Why bother with Orsini-Rosenberg? He's obviously no friend of yours.
Nine performances! Nine! That's all it's had - and withdrawn.
Mozart. It was good of you to come.
You flatter me.
How long will you give me?
No, please.
I would never miss anything that you had written. You must know that.
Wait! Ask him if he'd give me some money now. Tell him if he would, that would help me finish it.
Another? But that's too soon! Tomorrow night? It's impossible! Did he say a hundred?
Third measure, second beat starting on E.  Flam-mis a-cri-bus ad-dic-tis.  And fourth measure, fourth beat - D.  Ma-le-dic-tis, flam-mis a-cri-bus ad- dic-tis.  Do you have that?
C Major. Sopranos and altos in thirds. Altos on C. Sopranos above.  Vo-ca, vo-ca me, vo-ca me cum be-ne- dic-tis.
I am so ashamed.
You mean in Turkey?
Then why especially does it have to be in German?
What you think, Mozart, is scarcely the point. It is what His Majesty thinks that counts.
That will do, Herr Mozart!
Mozart! Herr Mozart, may I have a word with you please. Right away.
Can we see the scene with the music back, please?
Who is on this committee?
Herr Mozart -
Leave me alone.
Well?
Do you hear me?
Yes, Father. Yes! So much for my vow of chastity. What did it matter? Good, patient, hard-working, chaste - what did it matter? Had goodness made me a good composer? I realized it absolutely then - that moment: goodness is nothing in the furnace of art. And I was nothing to God.
All I ever wanted was to sing to Him. That's His doing, isn't it? He gave me that longing - then made me mute. Why? Tell me that. If He didn't want me to serve Him with music, why implant the desire, like a lust in my body, then deny me the talent? Go on, tell me! Speak for Him!
Oh? I thought you did so every day. So speak now. Answer me!
My son, why should you want all Vienna to believe you a murderer? Is that your penance? Is it?
Oh my son, my poor son!
Well, Mozart is already rehearsing.
Oh yes, yes. And that was?
Here I am, my angel.
Well, promise then.
Can't you think of anyone who might commission some work from him? I've done my best. I got him to arrange some Bach for my Sunday concerts. He got a fee - what I could afford. Can't you think of anyone who might do something for him?
But he's all right?
You know, did he seem depressed? Do you think he'll eat the food?
What exactly did he call out?
Did he say a wolf?
Dr. Hirsch, what's wrong? Is this more serious than I know?
Yes.
Dr. Hirsch?
No, why?
It was a wolf.
I'm afraid you have to eat something.
You put me in an awkward position, Mr. Kessler.
Aw come on, Miss Price!
I was. What are you reading?
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have asked you.
Now what do you want to talk about?
Don't be silly. Can I get you something?
Bathroom.
Tomorrow is the full moon.
I've left those pills for you.
Waking up at the zoo, that's not so insane. Having no clothes on? That's insane. What did I do last night, Alex?
The next corner we can get a cab.
Dr. Hirsch will know what to do.
He's playing a stupid joke, sir.
Leave me alone, dammit! You people are crazy! I've got to get away from here! I've got to do something!
Hello, Benjamin.
Well, all right then, be that way. Here, swallow this.
Feeling better?
The doctor will be round later. Would you like a picture book to look at? We have some lovely funny Beanos.
How are we feeling tonight?
I think he's a Jew.
Now see here young man.
Who is this girl?
Here, Gladys, Tom. Did you hear the one about the crashing plane?
No one brought them here! No one wanted them here!
Lunatic?
You've never had bad dreams before?
Did you get a good look at the man who attacked you?
No. In fact, your wounds were cleaned and dressed before you arrived here.
I really don't know.
Dr. Hirsch?  I'd rather not be by myself.
Rendezvous in Rome starring Jack Goodman and Debbie Klein. The love affair that shocked Europe! See torrid lovemaking at its most explicit! See Jack and Debbie expose their lust in the sacred halls of the Vatican! Never has the screen dared...
David, before we go in there I want you to know that - no matter what happens to us - it's your fault.
What about it?
Come on, Jack, shall we go?!!
That was weird. I guess leaving was the best idea.
A coyote.
Nice doggie. Good boy.
So you know what she does? She's so grief stricken she runs to find solace in Rudy Levine's bed.
I'm going completely crazy.
If you love me so much, Jack, you'll realize how disconcerting it is to share one's breakfast with the living dead!
You're not real.
Okay, you've seen me. Now go away.
I didn't mean it. I don't know what I'm saying. I'm not even sure it was me who killed those people. I don't remember doing it.
Well, even if I'm not the wolfman, I am crazy enough to do something like that. I mean, here I sit in Leicester Square talking to a corpse. I'm glad to see you, Jack.
What here?
What's that?
Hello, Tom.
What's the idea of turning her down? It sounds like a perfectly safe investment.
Oscar, what's the matter?
Say Matt, I'll have to have some money for those Manville payrolls.
Let me have ten bucks?
I remember once when your account checked.
And listen, wise guy - I'm setting friend time clock for exactly nine o'clock, so no squawks out of you guys in the morning.
Mr. Dickson in yet?
When he comes in, tell him we're waiting for him in the board room.
Don't make me laugh, Schultz!
You know Dickson as well as we do. He'll shut the doors before he gives up control.
We'll be forced to shut the doors. I've worked twenty-five years night and day to keep this bank alive. You've all made money out of it. Are you willing to help?
No. You can't reason with anyone else when you're in a jam. We pleaded with you to keep liquid, but you wouldn't listen to us. You preached to us about faith and a lot of other rubbish. Now you want our help. You want us to throw a lot of cash into a bank that you've wrecked. All right. There's one way you can get it. Give us an option on your stock and resign as president.
Say, you can't do that
Don't be a fool, Cluett. This is only going to make it worse for you.
What were you doing at Finlay's this morning?
What was my wife doing in your apartment last night?
Then what did you want to gamble for? If you'd have beat us out of fifty G's, you'd have been paid, wouldn't you? Well, we want our dough.
know, but
But Dude, listen - couldn't we make this some other time?
Here, here, here, now! Don't you go back to work on me, too. I'm getting tired of this. Besides, it's beginning to affect your looks
Come on Cyril, try a little bit of it out on me. I haven't had any first-class blarney thrown at me since the day I was married.
Doesn't that come next?
What?
You know, there ought to be a Congressional Medal for men like you. America's comfort to misunderstood wives. I never thought I would find myself in that class.
What is that, Mr. Bones?[7]
Are the payrolls ready for tomorrow?
I tell you, I'm not interested in your opinion.
If this isn't a red-letter day for Tom Dickson! First I trample on the Board of Directors, then I promote Matt here to assistant cashier, and now to complete the day I have a visit from my sweet and lovely and gorgeous wife. What a man, what a man!
Now Tom, you simply cannot go to Philadelphia tonight. That's all there is to it.
Longer.
Oh, Mr. Dickson - they're going to arrest Matt. They think he did it!
Yes?
Helen!
Oh, make that uniform blue.
Well, well, well - got your uniform, eh?
Well . . . uh . . . I . . .
All I know is the bank's been robbed and a murder's been committed. The way I see it, Brown here looks guilty.
You were right, Mr. Dickson! Brown didn't have anything to do with it. Here's your man.
Well, Sampson, what is it?
That's just exactly what he has been doing. This deal should have been closed weeks ago. Tell him to keep tomorrow open . . .
They've been coming in steady all morning. I have called for some extra police.
The bank's reputation wouldn't be worth a nickel after that. This is just a flurry, that's all. They've heard about the robbery and got panic-stricken. Listen, get a hold of our available securities and have them turned into cash. Wait a minute. Get my personal stuff and have that turned into cash too. Tell the boys anyone caught arguing with a depositor will be fired on the spot.
Look at them, Mr. Dickson. They're going crazy.
Yes, sir.
The fools! If they only knew it, they're making things worse for themselves. Somebody starts a silly rumor, and they lose their heads.
Yes, sir.
He's at a board meeting.
The ten dollars.
What's the matter, Matt? Gee, I thought you'd be thrilled to death.
Did you talk to him?
Never mind all that. What did you find out?
for the rheumatism, you know.
What time was it?
Sit down! When the watchman surprised you, you shot him - what'd you do with the gun?
So you were home last night?
You're carrying too much money on you, Hank. You better turn some in tonight.
Gatling! They've got a Gatling!
Our place, Clell Miller's, Sammy Johnston, the Creeders. Will Hite.
We got a problem here, brother?
That was because of... the reputation the gang had.
I ain't done --
Bob. I didn't...
Jesus mercy, that's Charlie Higgins, Dave Laller ...
Home. We go home. We ride like hell to get there, and we kill anything or anyone that comes between us and our homes. And when we get there we stay there and God help any fool who tries to get me to leave my farm again.
How many of them did he kill?
You have no shame.
But if we take their money and supplies...
"The outlaws calling themselves the James-Younger Gang shot their way out of town, wounding the Sherriff and three other townsfolk."
The things a fella has to do to get a little respect around here...
Where you boys going?
Because we were good at it?  Hell, we were great at it. Jesse, don't tell anyone I said this, because everybody knows I'm the toughest man in this town, but you are one terrifying sonofabitch with those guns.
I got seven thousand.
See, Frank's being smart about this.
Smells funny, it being mentioned in the paper.
What are you saying?
We'll make them pay for this.
Hey! We decide something, that's it! We're in this for the long haul, and this idea of me and Jesse's will help give us more places to hide out without worrying about some farmer with a shotgun sneakin' up on us in our sleep. We've got to think --
You 'um big lawman?
Then why can't I go in there?
Fine. I'll just wait here.
Every time I put my head up to hit that Gatling, they try to shoot it off.
That would have made an impression.
Whyyyy... he took down the Gatling gun and the cannon all by himself.
All we thought about was coming home. I swore I'd kill anybody who tried to get me off my farm again. If I have to go to war with the railroad to stay, fine by me.
"Big and older"?
You are a charmer.
You're looking a bit more spry now that somebody --
How'd it go in there?
Gents, we are in the middle of something here.
That's a lie. You could've bought a dozen farms with the money we've stolen.
They're all pinned down. Can't even get to the door.
How much of that story is true?
Ma, I'm glad to see you being nice to our Injun friend.
Ma! Please!
Jesse, is that your hand?
You shouldn't be up.
Teasing you is completely unfair.
I shouldn't tease a hero.
Mostly. It would be an all right life, for a bachelor.
Yep.
Zee.
I don't understand.
Aw, shucks, ma'am...
I can't believe I had to blow up a train for you.
Was it worth it?
Discretion? Sir, I am a man of the cloth.
Not too young to shoot a man, not to young to drink.
Jesse, you explain to Lyla. My girl, you know, from that time...
Thank you, Miss -- ?
Why don't we get a bottle of sherry to sip while we talk?
There's only four of them...
The final route for the railroad is complete.
This is him.
Listen, what are you doing tonight?
Ummm . . yeah. Luis is calling me tonight. I need to be home for that.
Yes?
Oh God, Patrick. Shut up.
Are we here?
Courtney, you're going to have the peanut butter soup with smoked duck and mashed squash. New York magazine called it a 'playful but mysterious little dish." You'll love it. And then...the red snapper with violets and pine nuts. I think that'll follow nicely.
No, you idiot. I said "Is it a receptacle tip?" Not, is Luis a despicable twit. Is it a receptacle tip? Get off me.
Why?
See? Happy? You dumb bitch? Are you happy, you dumb bitch?
Patrick?
This is nicer than your other apartment.
Your father practically owns the company. You can do anything you like, silly.
He's rich.
Are you using minoxidil?
Your hairline looks like it's receding.
If you really want to do something for me, you can stop making this scene right now.
Eggshell with Romalian type.  What do you think?
Girls dig Bateman. He's CQ. You're total CQ, Bateman.
Listen, what about dinner?
Are you sure?
It was a pretty long message, wasn't it?
By the way Davis, how is Cynthia? You're still seeing her, right?
What are you talking about? Bateman is what?
Now, Carnes, listen to me. Listen very, very carefully. I killed Paul Owen and I liked it. I can't make myself any clearer
Because I had dinner with Paul Owen twice in London...just ten days ago.
Patrick? Is that you?
What...is...it?
Jeez. That's not a helluva lot, is it?
What's that, a gram?
Yes, Caron's right. Gorbachev's not downstairs. He's at Tunnel.
Dorsia, yes?
There are no tables available tonight. The waiting list is also totally booked.
Ricky Hendricks has to cancel today. He didn't say what he was canceling or why.
That is...if you're not doing anything.
You don't need to lose any weight. You're kidding, right? You look great. Very fit.
Do you have a boyfriend?
Interesting.
Well, I guess I do. For a long time I was too focused on my work, I think, but now I've really begun to think about changing myself, you know, developing, and...growing.
Where are you? Patrick, what's wrong?
Welt...it depends, why?
Hubert's? Oh really? It moved uptown, right?
What do you mean, she was a hot number.
Elizabeth, it's three in the morning.
Don't tell him you're here.
Come on. Don't you find Christie attractive?
Come on. I think it would be a turn-on.
KIMBALL.
Oh right. Well, I haven't heard anything about the disappearance or anything...  Not on "Page Six" at least.
How old are you?
Bad habit.
Would you rather I not smoke?
What can you tell me about Paul Owen?
What kind of man was he? Besides...  the information you've just given.
Where did Paul hang out?
Was he involved at all , do you think, in occultism or Satan worship?
How's the investigation going? Taken anyone in for "formal questioning?" 
I had a date with a girl named Veronica.
Well...I...Wait...What information have you received?
Well, thank you, Mr. Bateman.
I think maybe you've got your dates mixed up.
Oh. KIMBALL Now where were you? 
Speak up. Come on.
How's the Ransom account going, Marcus?
Why are there copies of the Style section all over the place? Do you have a dog? A chow or something?
A lot of what Larry says is true. They just clone stuff, or reverse engineer it, and everybody gets stuck with their inferior version cause they --
I forgot. That's why you have to help me decide.
It's what they said it is. An unfinished broadcast studio. You were right... I just drove to Seattle and back.
That was -- different.
Where were you?  You know you can't keep anything from me.
Great!
Not like him, is it? To do a thing like that without telling you. You're not losing your hold on him, are you?
That'll be a test, won't it?
Milo?
This is the biggest Beta demo in like the history of software. You'd be my partner.
What?
Okay.
...When did you know?
That's gotta kill him, right?
Stigma? Larry! 60 billion buys you some slack in this world.
...Hello?
You know a lot about art, I guess.
Among other things... We know convergence is the real super-highway: all the PC's, TV's, phones, etc. linked together. Why cram it into a cable if you can use the whole sky?
No! Just waiting for my counselor to come by and introduce himself.
Milo. What's up?
Everything I do is under scrutiny. The questions they ask, trying to make anything strategic look sordid.  I'm confused. Doesn't everybody in business try to get ahead?
It scales, don't you think?
I heard what happened.
Did you?
I meant did you find other stuff to --
Been thinking about the push mechanism in the handler. And it came over me: it's in the wrong place.
I'm okay. It's going well!
That's great! Thanks.
"Dear Lisa. I've enjoyed working with you. I'd be lying if I didn't say I find you attractive. But in my heart I know that Alice..."  You left my party to send E-mail?
I'm pretty close. But when I wrote the last contact switches, it wiped out a piece of the content filer. You know what it's like, writing software.
Hasn't affected his work, though.
All the companies know. The faculties tell 'em. At the target schools.
I think you should go.
Your app kind of blew mine out of the water.
You guys'll be using Teddy's old space, is that okay?
Delbert seems to enter #21 twice. Without leaving the first time.
...Were you?
That's great. I -- didn't know.
I know why you're so secretive. Why you won't let anybody near you.  I know what he did to you.
Is that my -- scenario?  Tell me.
I always felt if a -- boy I liked ever found out -- he'd run. He'd think I was unclean.
The mainstream media. TV, or a newsmagazine.
He's buying up pretty much everything: cable companies, baby bells, picture libraries, museum rights, film archives... Getting ready for Skywire.
Time?
How close are you?
Why were you snooping in my office?
Thank God.
They know I broke in. Alice helped me.  Shrot's not one of them. He's blundering into this on his own.
Same with the excerpts I'm choosing: they'll play against any of the images you described.
Why?!
Please don't go.
Wanted to say goodbye to him...
I'm cool. They didn't touch the machine. Or my disks. Probably didn't know what they were. So, you a Moonie yet?  Milo?
So how'd you like the house?
Every geek here's got a thing for Lisa. But that's about the biggest reaction she's had to anybody.
Did you download Corey? In San Jose?
What, and watch all my earnings go...  Down the toilet?
In Japan, men come first and women come second.
Where am I?
You mean Mrs. Kensington?
Oh, yes. Thank you.
Hello, Exposition.
I'm sorry, Basil, I thought she was a man.
Be careful.
Well, Austin, you've stopped Dr. Evil from destroying the world with his subterranean nuclear probe, and somehow you and Agent Kensington managed to escape unscathed from his evil lair.
Congratulations, Field Agent Kensington!
Hey Austin Powers, it's me, Mick Jagger.
Yes, I am programmed to answer any question.
No, man, what we swingers were rebelling against were uptight squares like you, whose bag was money and world domination. We were innocent, man. If we'd known the consequences of our sexual liberation, we would have done things differently, but the spirit would have remained the same.  It's freedom, man.
Mr. Powers, my job is to acclimate you to the Nineties. You know, a lot's changed since 1967.
Do I make you horny? Randy, you know. To you, am I eros manifest?
I don't get it.
Fancy a nibble?
I haven't had fun like that since college.
Always wanting to have fun, that's you in a nutshell.
You're smashed, Vanessa.
No, did you use a condom?
Hello, luv.
Yeah, I can't believe Liberace was gay. Women loved him, man. I didn't see that one coming.
Who?
Austin, we don't look anything like our photo badges.
First, I plan to soil myself. Then, I plan to regroup and think about the next move. Any thoughts?
Austin, what's your point?
It's not what it looks like, Vanessa.  At ease, boys.
I have something to tell you.
OK, Austin Danger Powers: One blue crushed-velvet suit. One frilly lace cravat. One gold medallion with peace symbol. One pair of Italian shoes. One pair of tie-dyed socks, purple. One vinyl recording album: Tom Jones, Live at Las Vegas. One Swedish-made penis enlarger pump.
Commander, this is Slater in SoWest Com Three. We have a potential bogey with erratic vectoring and an unorthodox entry angle.
Shut up.
But my design was perfect!  Your autonomic functions were shut down, and even though your arm wasn't frozen, the aging was retarded, therefore your right arm is only slightly older than the left.
Remember when we froze your semen, you said that if it looked like you weren't coming back to try and make you a son so that a part of you would live forever?
Release the sharks!  All the sharks have had laser beams attached to their heads. I figure every creature deserves a warm meal.
What is it now?
No, the boy's right. I really am evil.
An evil vet?
Fascinating. What are your plans for this evening?
And that's how you want to live your life, is it?
I have a better idea. I'm going to put him in an easily-escapable situation involving an overly- elaborate and exotic death.
Dad, we just made a breakthrough in group!
Well, God knows he tried, but I've been rather firm with him, Mummy. You didn't tell me he was so obsessed with sex. It's bizarre.
No, it's been too long. Best to leave things alone.
What do you want to do, Scott?
We don't label people here, Scott.
Normally, we'd be eager to oblige --
The technology is brand new. Soon it will be more powerful. We anticipate a huge demand. Leave us your number. We'll be in touch.
Mrs. Peel ... Come quickly. Brolly's been betrayed! I'll tell you everything ... The weather's getting worse and worse ... they're after me ... coming for me ... come quickly!
May I help you, madam ...
No women. Not in Boodles. Not since 1922.
Sir August ... ? Sir August ... ?
My number two. Special assignments. She's --
How curious ...
What are you trying to do to me?
Who?
The doors and walls are monitored, Mrs. Peel. This is a very secure establishment.
Ahem. As I was saying, perhaps another macaroon ...
Of course. I planned that, too.
You disappoint me, Emma.  Can't you guess?  For you. It was all for you ...
Such as?
The missing piece of the jigsaw. I tried to get you to give it to me as Peter; I tried to steal it from you as Dr. Darling. As myself I'll be a bit less subtle.  With this ring my plan will be complete.
Dyed in the wool. But I can admire someone who doesn't play by the rules.
I didn't. Mother did.
Sir August Merryweather ... why are we seeing him first?
No thanks.
The family does seem to be somewhat meteorologically inclined.
Strange.
But that's absurd. I may not be over-fond of you, Steed, but it's not my style.
That's possible. Sir August was convinced he'd met me before. But I'd never met him. Another odd thing. When it rained, he said it was just as someone had promised.
Elementary, Mrs. Peel. Trubshaw isn't the only shoemaker still practicing his trade ...
For you, Mrs. Peel.
But
Do you always drive this fast?
What, Lady Disdain? Are you yet breathing?
This must be the last straw.
Where am I?
Was I?
You followed me.
Because you always obey orders ...
Mmm ... what are you doing?
I thought you played by the rules.
Please don't tell me it's how you play the game.
His name's Jones. 'Invisible' Jones.
We must hurry, Mrs. Peel ...
What's that you're wearing?
I don't recall Siberia being this warm, Steed.
Our chaperon.
You don't believe him?
The World Council of Ministers meets tomorrow to convene the new global defense initiative --
Under the circumstances Mother didn't see fit, but I think I can get you in ...
You reek of Mrs. Peel's Black Leather ...
Still doesn't. Better safe than sorry.  She was in a dangerous game, Steed. High stakes. She may prove to be a risk.  If she is, there's only one solution.  Termination.
I'm going to follow up on a hunch of my own. If I'm right, Mrs. Peel is innocent and you have a mole.
Mrs. Peel -- ?
No, please! I beg you ...
The last one you'll ever see.
Rules are made to be broken.
Aren't you forgetting about something?
What's happening?
Does Cole know about this?
Debbie... I don't believe it. I'm so excited.
That's what we're going to find out...
I'm glad you guys came by... What's the occasion?
All right!
Cole...
What's Debbie's blue book value right now?
Okay, ten thousand plus a G.E. toaster oven, a Litton microwave, a Cuisinart...
Rick, I want to talk to you.
I don't want any trouble.
I'm ready to make you another deal.
Cole, what the hell are you doing?
Yes, son, did you find out where the bachelor party is?
I know you're as unhappy as I am about Debbie's marriage to Rick.
Cole, I don't want you to give up on her.
Cole?
Cole, listen to me... I've got to tell you...
Cole, I'm marrying Rick.
God, you're a slob.
Don't worry... it's supposed to do this.
Of course. I'm a traditional guy... It's a traditional event.  Well, what do you think?
Huh? Wha...
Before or After I have my nervous breakfown?
Have a good time. Don't make it too late.
I can't trust you!
And I want to be with someone who understands the meaning of the word commitment.
I don't believe you.
Great. Now, what do you want to do about it?
Are you okay?
Are you sure this is a good idea?
That doesn't mean it was Rick's party.
Why is Cole here?
I hope Ilene's all right.
Great bathing suit.
Thanks for helping us out, Ed. We appreciate it.
This is bad public relations. I was planning to do a lot of business with you. But now I'm going to have to go elsewhere.
Sounds swell... I'm really touched. And my getting married's not gonna change a thing between me and my pals. We're still gonna go bowling on Tuesdays, play cards on Fridays and wear women's clothes on Sunday night. I love you guys... I always will.
Looks like the only one who got screwed here was you.
I'm telling you I am, Joe.
You are being in luck. Customers in same hotel. I let you have them at cut-rate price for 45 minutes.
So, Larry, how have you been?
You want to share it?
What the hell are you doing?
Are any of those right?
Rick, hit the ball easier, son. You don't have to kill it.
Girls, why don't we go inside for lunch.  Boys, would you mind bringing in that lemonade?
Mrs.?
Excuse me, but this is as arousing as a stroll through the Vatican.
Don't you love it when old friends stop by?
I'm not really hungry.
Under the table!
This is your bachelor party. You haven't had sex with anyone yet.
What's this?
How 'bout this?
That's an even trade... a cotton ball for all my blood.
Well, the first month it's great. The second month things calm down a little. By the third month you're looking through your old girlfriends' phone numbers; by the fourth month you're numb; by the fifth month, hopefully the football season starts.
Oh... it's... er... the guys from the beer convention. We're bringing them to the party.
Can you believe how perfect it fits?
Adcox, go with Pengelly and check the other side.
Aw man, Stephen, listen to me...
You stupid son of a bitch! What the fuck are you doing!
Did you do it for Tim?
It doesn't go like that.
Well, look what we have here. Nice costume. Rent it?
People actually used to pay you for this?
I know you cold, Brian. The scary thing is, you probably could have faked it for awhile. But you see, in this job there's no place to hide. Isn't like selling log cabins. You have a bad day here -- someone dies. And that's not fucking good enough. Want another beer?
-- I was doin' it! I was up there fucking doin' it. You don't know, man, you don't know what I did!
C'mon ladies, let's roll some hose...
Ready?
Brian, look --
Yeah? What have you got to do?  Look at you. Look at your face. All the things you must be thinking. Man, you must really hate my guts. Well, you know what? It's okay.
Oh God, Stephen, what's going on with you?
You crazy son of a bitch, why couldn't you stay behind a desk where you belong?
Don't tell them about Adcox... Don't let 'em...
Huh.
Not quite. Just visiting. I live in Lincoln Park now.
I work for city hall.
Let me tell you something. Martin Swayzak is going to be this town's next mayor.
Brian, do you always have to be so stupid? Think about your future for once.
Hey.
Boss and I are up to about three words an hour.
Hi.
If you weren't at least the 300th person to ask me that, I'd probably be pissed.  Boy, you sure know it's a man's world sometimes...
You think that's really any of your business?
Oh yeah, he's the real fireman.  Who are you? Just another probie working for Swayzak --
Hi.
We still talking?  Look, I'm sorry about the other day --
Y'know, four years ago I was working in a bakery. Two years ago I was bringing Marty coffee and he didn't even know my name. I run that office now. Marty believed in me and I believe in him. You want me to just throw that away?
I'm close... but I can't get who it is...
Your first question should be who isn't. It isn't a spark, Brian. Not enough damage. And an insurance pro? Where's the profit margin?
-- No no, your turn. Tell me a story.
Famous story even. Straight burn. Just an engine and truck first on scene. What did you feel, Brian, when you first got there?
That's a probie answer. You're smarter than that, Brian.
I got it after we talked to Ronald. Torches. Want to fry the whole goddamn world. But the fires that killed those guys never really burned up much. -- The burns were all lit in outlets surrounded by double firebreaks in the walls. And he made his burns backdrafts. 
In a word, Brian, what is this job all about?
Hey boss, Dekom Trust is owned by Pan Illinois... which is majority controlled by Lakeside Dynamics... which is a division of Windy City Ventures... who's partners are...  Alan Seagrave, Donald Cosgrove, and Jeffrey Holcomb.
So Seagrave and Holcomb were accountants...
This is the copy of Swayzak's manning report that was released. Everybody on this job knows it's bullshit but we could never argue with the numbers. They're all airtight.
Your brother was a good man.
Oh, man, I'm sorry.
Man. Something sure put a crimp in his evening.
Y'know what Stephen said to me, right when all the shit was coming hard? "You never know till the moment the fire stares you down if you're just gonna do this job or be great at it".
What?
So, you surviving without me?
Uh huh. And "Pioneer's Pride, Mobile Log Cabins". That was in your blood about six months wasn't it?
I hate it when we gotta fucking go look for it.
Stevie? Rimgale's here to see you.
They're waitin' man.
Uh, Helen, I wanted to talk to you a second about Sean...
Look, I'm sorry I --
Shadow.
You don't know him.
Knock it off. Now.
-- Burn them.
Got a cause?
Mr. Swayzak! How ya doin'?
The Church is a fucking racket. I know how they operate. I've been part of the racket since the first time some faggot priest spilt water on my head. My Aunt Lu says I was crying all the way through. Yeah, I know their game inside out. Now I'm free of it and I'm gonna stay that way.
C'mere. You got some good blow, right?
Can you believe the nerve of this fucking guy? He kills people for fun, and then, he puts up 100 G to bring in some guys who raped a nun. What a sick fuck. Man...
But you could do it, baby. We could use the bread...
You brought it back to the Church. And then it made it's way back to me, again.
There. Now you've got your profit and more. You'll have more product day after tomorrow, right?
I forgive you.
I forgive you.
I forgive you.
Fuck yesterday's game. The World Series is seven games not six. Put in my bet.
Here's the deal: You meet me tonight across from the Garden. 33rd & 8th. At the beginning of the Ninth Inning. We'll listen to the end of the game together. You bring your cash, I'll bring mine.
I got them all going for Oakland. With bullshit money. We'll cover the $800.
Take your money? This guy will blow up your house and everyone in it!
Oooo... Big fucking scary guy. Just put $120,000 on tomorrow's game.
Forgive me Father, for I have sinned. It has been two days since my last confession. Father, my sin is a terrible sin. A sin of omission. There was another sin that happened at the same time, and in the same place, but my sin I think was graver stil.
Father, if it was so trivial, so natural, so -- No. I have sinned. And you must listen if you are to prescribe an appropriate act of contrition, and to absolve me. Father, what would you do if you had but one day in which to use your arms to serve God?
Those boys, those sad, raging boys... They came to me as the needy do. And like many of the needy, they were rude. Like all the needy, they took. And like all the needy, they needed.  Father. I knew them; They learn in our school. And play in our schoolyard. And they are good boys.
Keep trying.
C'mon.  It's easy.  It's the same thing y'all do out at the Yankee game, no different 'cept we changing one word.  Everybody go it?
Alright.  Here we go.  Let's go NIGGERS!  LET'S GO NIGGERS!
My group we need some exposure. Was wondering if you could hook a brother up?
So now I see where you're coming from.  Just because we ain't rapping about Gucci, Timberland, Rolex, Benz, Cristal, ho's and bitches, we're pseudo.
Yeah, him.
What do you do?
Life is beginning to look up.  It's all good in da neighborhood.
I'm not smiling.
It's that bad, huh?  It's all over my face.
Certified ladies' man, huh?
What's wrong with him?
I'm not drinking the Kool-Aid.
Jim Jones, y'know.  I'm not drinking the Kool-Aid.
So that's what you been doing?
You're in this up till ya neck.
Sloan and I have been looking all over for you.
No offense.
What about in the mean time?  Not the in between time?
I would like to change your name.
I want you to start using the name Mantan and not Manray if you don't mind.
Our guest today is Pierre Delacroix. He is the creator of the highly controversial TV show MANTAN. Let's get right into it.  You have been called by some in the community a traitor, a sellout, an Uncle Tom. Why does your show generate such feelings?
But the line has to be drawn.
The middle class black family moves into a white suburban enclave.  The middle class black family moves into a small Southern town that is run by the KKK.  The middle class single black father raises his teenage daughter.  The middle class single black father raises his teenage daughter.  The middle class single black mother raises her teenage son.  And so on and so forth.  It's too clean, too antiseptic...
Word!!!
The name of the show?
Protest finally forced "Amos and Andy" off the air.  Could stop us from ever getting on.
I will not be held responsible for these revisions.  These changes are not the way I want to go.  This is an outrage.  This is a sham.  A violation!
Yo, DeLa, I just got the news from the CNS brass.  They saw some clips from the pilot and they're rushing it onto the air.  Yo, we're a midseason replacement, ordered 12 shows.  We're on in 3 weeks.  Didya hear what I just said, Yo?
Pull up a chair.  Oh, excuse me, this is my lady DOT.
Good woman.  I trained her right.
Dem white boys giving you a hard time?
The truth is never let them seeya sweat.  You do that, that's half the battle.
Glad to meet you, too.  You are all your father talks about.
So he drank himself into a stuper?
Don't tell him it's from me or he won't take it.
How was it?
Hello.
Why did you even come up with that shit if you didn't want it made?
We both lied to him.
Same here.
So you have your small victory, now what?
The Jolly Nigger Bank.
How so?
Oh, is he?  You getting jiggy with Mantan?
Can I kiss you too?
Please let me know when you hear from Daddy, get a number or something.
He's performing at some place outside of Richmond, Virginia.
Even more reason to see him.  He'll be overjoyed with your success.
I won't forget.  When are you coming up here to see your mother?
How did you get this gig?
Good luck, Jukka.  Do a good show.
The Mantan Manifesto.  Catchy ain't it?  Number One.  We gainfully employ African Americans, in front of and behind the cameras.  Two. Let the audience decide.  Three. Who put these critics in charge? These so-called cultural police? Four.  Who determines what is black? Five.  Mantan is a satire.  Six. If they can't take a joke, "F" 'em.
I never had a really real pair before.
So what's up with you and DeLa?
Money and nothing else?
This is my best friend Sleep 'N Eat.
No mo' "city slickers."  Ahh, can't you smell the sweet aroma of the ripe watermelons and high cotton?
Oh, because on our first date, she let me...
...then what about...
...like macaroni and cheese...
Sleep 'N Eat, what's the matter with you?  Using all dose ten dollar words?
I feel a song a comin' on.
Oh you do, huh?
I hope you save a little somethin' somethin'.
Maybe you need to start.
Why all of a sudden are you flippin' on me?  This blackface thing was part of the deal from the git-go. Don't even try to play it like you ain't a part of all this.  You down with Delacroix.
You're sure this is a good idea.
Don't try to change to the subject.
Hoity-toity!  John Best, what's the matter here?
Upon my word, sir, I think you have acted very coolly.
Sir, I'm a British officer.
What is the service, sir?
And this is the return you make for his kindness!  Didn't he harbor you in his house when your father died, and hasn't he given you and your mother, rent-free, your fine house of Jamesville yonder?
Look here, Roderick, my boy; this is silly business.  The girl will marry Best, mark my words; and as sure as she does, you'll forget her.  You are but a boy.  Best is willing to consider you as such.  Dublin's a fine place, and if you have a mind to take a ride thither and see the town for a month, here are twenty guineas at your service.  Make Best an apology, and be off.
She took on so at your going away that she was obliged to console herself with a husband.  She is now Mrs. John Best.
Mr. O'Higgins, we are in your debt, and rest assured, sir, you have friends in this house whenever you are in Dublin.  Mister O'Higgins, I wonder if I know your good father?
Chevalier, though I cannot say how, I believe you have cheated me.
Where is my rascal, Lazlo?
I risk nothing, for I am certain to kill him.
I entered here, monsieur, at a bad moment for you; it seems that you love this lady.
Perfectly so; and what is more, I will tell you that I love her, and that I am not of a humor to put up with rivals.
A man may need to do that, and find it amusing; but a girl is bound by other laws.
You will do as you please.  It seems to me that such a matter can hardly be discussed until after people know each other.  Do you not agree?
As soon as I saw you loved me, I was pleased, and I gave you every opportunity to fall more in love with me, being certain that, for my part, I would never love you.  But after our first kiss, I found that I had no power over myself.  I did not know that one kiss could matter so much.
Why are you shaking?
Were you obliged to dance five times with Captain Best, and then stroll out with him into the garden?
If ever I meet him again, you shall see which is the best man of the two.  I'll fight him with sword or with pistol, captain as he is.
As much as possible?
Last month, the Duke of Suffolk spent no more.
Then this must be done tomorrow.
I have good news for you, Mr. Cosgrove.  The firm of Bracegirdle and Chatwick, in the city of London, are prepared to lend you 20,000 pounds, pledged against your interest in the Edric mines.  They will redeem the encumbrances against the property, which amount to some 10,000 pounds, and take a twenty- year working lease on the mines. They will lend you the 20,000 pounds against the lease income, which they will apply to the loan as it comes in, and they will make a charge of 18% per annum interest on the outstanding loan balance.
Well, if my intentions are what you think they are -- if I do wish to step into your shoes, what then?  I have no other intentions than you had yourself.  Lady Cosgrove's wealth may be great, but am I not of a generous nature enough to use it worthily?  Her rank is lofty, but not so lofty as my ambition.  I will be sworn to muster just as much regard for my Lady Cosgrove as you ever showed her; and if I win her, and wear her when you are dead and gone, corbleu, knight, do you think that it will be the fear of your ghost will deter me?
Yes.  He brought me in his carriage, and he will call for me at midnight.
He will believe that it will please me if he asks about it, and I shall tell him everything except some circumstances which might humiliate him.
Hurricane kept you up, too?
Don't you ever point a gun at me!
Fuck, what the fuck is going on --
Did -- did you --
Hey, I --  Holy fuck... holy fuck, what the fuck did you guys do?
What about you, wandering around alone? At least we have an alibi --
You're under military arrest, it's not gonna happen. What's wrong with baseball?
You did Basic here?
Why'd you ask for a cop, Ray?
That'd be my reaction too --
I apologize --
We're not finished yet --
We don't need the tapes --
Dunbar you are to stand here and guard this nigger for the next twenty- four hours! He is not to be given food, water, or clothes! If he so much as moves, you are to blow his nigger brains out, is that clear?
Right?
Maybe, but that don't make me a killer --
Mueller.
You hated West, Mueller loved him --
Bullshit.
Why... why didn't you tell me?
A test will no doubt link you to the killing --
My father is a powerful man. Over the years he's used that power to protect me, in one form or another, from certain... unpleasantries.  I am a homosexual.
What happened to "degrees"?
Why did he come back for you?
Somebody emptied a full clip into him --
Dunbar was running out the door? Ohhhhhh... See that's where I was confused, because I thought you said Nunez was running out the door.
Jail if he's lucky, the gas chamber if he's not --
That bad?
Which gives us about five hours. Why'd you call me?
Pike killed West, Dunbar killed Mueller, Childs, and Nunez.
You mean not enough to save you.
If you let him testify then it would have all come out. West was supposed to take care of it out there, shut Nunez up and then disappear. But it got messy and people got killed. So you called your old pal Tom Hardy, figuring if worse came to worse, he'd cover for you.
What I can't understand is why you signed these. If you'd just let West take care of the paperwork, no one would have known, but you got careless. So when Pike finally told the truth you had to get rid of him, too.
No more witnesses. West's a ghost. But it doesn't matter because we have your signature, the hospital log, and Kendall's toxicology report. And that'll be enough.
You can't duck this, Bill. I may have done every goddamn thing in my life wrong but I won't let this happen.
Ah, Christ
Three things. First -- You don't have a choice. Second -- I've never taken a bribe in my life. And Third -- I'm still a little drunk from last night, so if I skip over the witty banter and move forward to straight hitting on you, try not to take offense. Tell me about the two guys.
Levi? Who names their kid Levi --
Typical army brat story. Dad was noncom, Mom was a Nurse. There was never any real doubt of joining up.
You guys really got the shit kicked out of you here.
He's telling the truth, up to a point.
West was a monster! Fifteen years ago, I was here, I was Section Eight, I was Pike. Fuck being the knife dummy -- that thing he did, stripping Pike down, making him stand outside all night? He did that every year, he did that to me. Fifteen years ago, I wanted him dead, and now I'm supposed to care that somebody offed him? Sorry, no can do. I tried.
Talk it through: Childs, Mueller, and Nunez know they're going out on the regular Tuesday Night drill, hurricane or no hurricane, so they plan it: Kill West, pin it on Pike.
Dunbar.
Buttfucks the cabin?
So why, after Dunbar drags Kendall out from under a house, does the Senator's son try and get us to put his savior in the gas chamber?
No, I didn't. I wanted to humiliate him. For what he did to Dunbar. For fucking over the little guy.
Four --
Hardy, what are you doing --
This isn't the time --
That's not true.
You're a good man, Hardy.
Nah.
Your phone number?
Pike, please --
Maybe we shouldn't go.
I remember now, it was before the explosion --
It won't work --
Dunbar's telling the truth.
I told him what had really happened to West. Told him to keep quiet about it or I'd destroy him. Because if it came out that I was involved with the whole PX scam, my father would be finished.
I used it to start the fire --
Goddammit, Ray, we gotta get out of here --
You are to be stripped of all weapons and placed under guard --
Search parties for the others are fanning out in a ten click radius from the pickup. If they're hurt and we can get to them in time...
Some of you may have heard there's a hurricane coming! American soldiers do not wait for good weather -- they do not wait for a bright sunshiney day to do their duty! An American Soldier learns to operate in the worst conditions and turn said conditions into an advantage against their enemy! Anyone who thinks these conditions are too harsh, feel free to lay down and die, you get me?
Bloom like a flower?
I have to leave. Tonight.
Fine, you do it.
What the hell are you doing? This is my girl. Mine!
I'm eight. That means when I'm eighteen, you'll be 28. And when I'm 28, you'll only be 38.
Promise me you'll come back.
Hi. How are you feeling?
Means when you dream about something that's going to happen.  Like one night, I had a dream where this crow came and told me, "Your Aunt is going to die." I was so scared I woke up my parents. They told me it was just a dream, to go back to bed. But the next morning, my Aunt Stacy was dead.
Because see, my mother was banging the milkman.
I thought you said you didn't have a church wedding.
Karl.
No, but I hear it's terrible. Then you spend years trying to corrupt and mislead this child, fill its head with nonsense and still it turns out perfectly fine.
People needn't worry so much. It's not my time yet. This isn't how I go.
There was this panhandler who used to stop me every morning when I came out of this coffee shop near the office.
The maple tree and the Buick. We heard it.
But the real story is how I got the car. You see...
The river.
You become what you always were. A very big fish.  And that's the way it happens.
Oh.
How did you get so many?
I was drying out.
I can't imagine any place better than here.
This is it? The whole vault.
How did you know my father?
Look, I don't know how much you want to know about any of this. You have one image of your father and it would be wrong for me to go and change it. Especially this late in the game.
I'm sorry. It seems every hour I have to...
I'm going with you.
Do you love your father?
Look, I know why you like him. I know why everyone likes him. But I need you to tell me I'm not crazy.
I need you on my side.
What I mean is, do you really know what's going on in his head?
Is he awake?
Did you and Dad have any other property?
So you never bought any land.
You know what for.
I got you those trousers from Paul Smith.
Yeah it was okay.
What? What are you doing?
This is sensitive. Your car. Lovely car. Doesn't necessarily give the right impression.
What did he say?
So?
Tell me.
Tell me what he said.
How is bank?
What did he say? Tell me!
He wants the money from your bank.
You don't understand. He wants all the money that is in your bank.
Just leave her alone.
I bet.  What about me? Am I how you imagined?
Do uh... Sorry. Can you follow me? Do you understand what I'm saying?
Good. Or should I speak slower?
Syevodnya?
"Frenzy".
Oh, I don't know. In my job as Deputy Assistant of New Business at the bank would have to listen to the problems of a great many individuals. This took a lot of understanding and sympathy, to try to work out solutions to their problems. But, you see, I'm not in that line of work anymore. Nowadays I'm a bank robber.
You must think... I'm the biggest pillock... In the world.
In every sense. If at all possible.
I'm going to be sick. Where's the...
What?
So, uh, Alexei, which I know isn't his name...
Fine.
Excuse me?
And? What are you saying?
What's a moral orgasm John? Tell me how it feels exactly.
Some... What does that mean?
I got what I paid for.
What? I... I wasn't saying...
The rest of the world, John, it's not all like St. Albans.
Are you scared?
What?
Nobody's that unhappy.
I've got an hour. Can I buy you a coffee?
Yeah. No thanks.
You can probably buy them on the flight.
Hurry. I'll wait for you here.
My name's Sophia.
You know the rules.  You do know the rules, don't you?
Then start taking them seriously.
I need to uh...
What do you need?
He black alright, he just ain't blue.
You ain't the kicker, are you?
Thought you had a skirt earlier.
Ronnie ship out this mornin'?
We leavin' this weekend. Deke got a friend in Mobile gonna get him a job at the water company...
Think this about money still, ya old fool?
Thought we was gonna be friendly about this.
Better than what you give.
SHUT UP! SHUT UP!
Don't... don't say that to me...
Mm-mm... Mm-mm...
Take it easy now. Don't rush it.
Now, no harm's come to you... and I aim to keep it that way. Ain't gonna... gonna run a train over ya... or however you call it... see... you was runnin' wild on me... these fever dreams you was havin'... these fits. I'd be chasin' you all night.
Look it, mister... you wanna have your way, you take it. I'll do whatever you want. But you gotta let me go. You can't do this! You can't KEEP ME HERE!
You take it straight?
Still makin' jokes?
If you want... I can take you back to town now.
How you feelin' today?
First hooked up with that bitch when she was 16. Girl was fuckin' the principal and two of her teachers. You know coach Reynolds?
That kind of talk is between us. Don't you go in there with that shit on your tongue.
You get a call from Rose?
Are you outta ya GODDAMN MIND?
A naked woman, chained in ya house?
Laz, I know about that girl.  Good number of this town's sinners got my ear, you know.  Oh, Laz. She's had a mess of crabs and them STD's. What'chu thinking?
You treat folks special when they company. It's just supper, R.L., shit.
Then what?
Yeah, you know you home, old man. You just walked through the door.
And now these three remain: faith, hope and love. But the greatest of these is love.  Who gives this girl in marriage?
You can't hurt people... and then just say, I'm sorry, and then everything just gets washed away. Why would heaven want people like that. People who... do what they want and then... switch.
I'm a what?
Goddamn it, I ask you a question, you better answer it, or I'm gonna blast a hole in ya!
No. That's not why...  Why we always gotta do this? I mean, you and me been at each other as far back as I can remember. Wasn't no love between us. And I'm your daughter. I'm the only family you got.
Hey, hey, where you goin'?
He works for Frank Abolofia. Atlantic City.  Casinos.
Nick, let's go hunting.  Bag Cavello.
Some party.
Where do we start looking for this guy?
No, this is the place for the young Yakuza.
You're doing fine, Ich.  Now drop it, okay?
Nick...
Broiled fish paste cake, Kelp roll, soybean curd, devils tongue --
Yakuza.
You can't come in.  They don't want --
... A Godfather.  His man was killed at the printing plant.
I want to go talk to him.
What's in the box?
Nick, you can't do this.
I was ready to have your ass for taking off on me.
Someone attacked him.
What's that for?
Louder, pal, louder.
Don't give him any more.
You know where I can get a decent cup of coffee this time of night? I'm buying.
I've heard of Sugai.  I've also heard of the emperor.  They're both national treasures.  One's a hood.
My Japanese isn't that hot... Besides, you'll never get in.
Where's the wife?
I don't remember saying yes.
Can't make you change your mind?
Keep the change.
This is my stop.
One guy do all the damage?
Doesn't speak a word of English. And he won't speak Japanese either. No papers.  The Japanese embassy is very interested.
You lost a man we wanted for some time.  It was very incompetent on your part, officer.
Hey, inspector, I don't intend to take the rap for this.
Because I want you to tell me.
Your plane leaves at six.  Two officers will escort you.
Seven years work by the finest engraver.  Mass produced, sequentially numbered.  The best there has ever been, Mr. Conklin.
Why tell me this?
I'm sure glad you found us, Sebastian.  What do you think, Mary?
Because by the second day of incubation any cells that have undergone reversion mutation give rise to revertant colonies -- like rats leaving a sinking ship.  The ship sinks.
Then a repressor protein that blocks the operating cells.
He's not really my friend.  I just do a job for him now and then.
No.
You're our best and only friend.
Where are you going, Sebastian?
What's going on down there?
This is my Uncle Roy, Sebastian.
I want to do it.
What was he after?
You got a machine on it yet?
Machines can be helpful sometimes, but they can also be a pain in the ass.  Ask for a trace on a forger and you might wind up at a steel- mill.  I don't mind a bum-steer once in a while -- it's their personalities that usually get me.  Somebody once said that man makes machines in his own image.  If that's true, whoever made Esper should have been shot.
You equipped for random questions?
Here's something you might find interesting.  They have been built to emulate the human in every way except in its emotional spectrum. However, after a period of time it is only logical that such a 'mechanism' would create its own emotional responses, hate, love, fear, anger, envy.
Those cockroaches?
How long you had these guys?
How old am I?
Hey, it's okay.  I like to pee. So how are you doing?
Let's hear it.
Considering the nature of your work, that could be unhealthy.
Why didn't you go?
I'd like  you to take a look at these pictures.
This one looks familiar, but I don't know.  Naw.  There's one came in today looks a little like this one but...
Who?
Nothing.  She wanted to know about suck night.
It that mother real?
It's a good job.
Are you apprehensive?
In a magazine you come across a full-page photo of a nude girl.
Uh-huh.
You know what I think?
Is this to be an empathy test?
But in your profession that is a risk.
We're going to have to start the sequence again if you don't stay with me, Deckard.  Concentrate.
You're not responding to the stimulus.  I can see right here, I'm not getting a reading.
I kinda get nervous when I take tests.
You're in a desert, walking along in the sand when all of a sudden you look down and see a...
Maybe you're fed up, maybe you want to be by yourself -- who knows.  So you look down and see a tortoise.  It's crawling towards you...
Know what a turtle is?
How come you were in my truck?
What about friends?
Beautiful.
Your mom was a dancer?
I'm Nina Aron, Adam.
We want you to come with us so we can talk some more about your experiences.
Please excuse this interruption.
I'm sorry, and legs. Legs, butt and hair.  Well, isn't he?  And shallow, as well?
Come on, Heathcliff, I'll walk you to the corner.
So far?
Again.
Wait! Please wait!  I'll make a deal with you!  I'll give you a Rogers Hornsby, if you'll take me to the hotel!
Rogers Hornsby's worth like four thousand dollars!
Perry Como!  You had him!  Go back! Go back!
How's that?
I am so glad to see you!!  I thought I'd never see you again!
I can't, it's yours.
I knew this would happen!  You're like a lost puppy!
Wait! Wait!
I guess we'll need another locker.
There's something else I would like you to help me with.
Then forget it.
One who's not a mutant.
Get out!
Never drive again!
Where's he gone?
The guy with the underpants!
Yep.  You know, my father -- who is a scientist -- says that everything is a miracle. Everything. Until recently I wasn 't sure what he meant by that.
Then just help me find a girlfriend! That's all I ask. I'll give you every single card I've got left!
Okay. I like that.
I've never lied to you.  I've maybe let you believe things that you wanted to believe, but I've never lied.
Adam?!
There.
Hi, Eve!
All in yellow?  Oh!  That was my father!
Like a painting?
Like one of Mom's?
Thank you, Mom! Thanks, Dad!
One more thing. If you find a healthy young woman, bring her back with you.
My gosh, those Commies are brilliant! You've got to hand it to 'em!  "No, we didn't drop any bombs!  Oh yes, our evil empire has collapsed!  Poor, poor us!"  I bet they've even asked the West for aid!  Right?!
That's right?
Who use to own it?
What's the capitol?
Not on him.
Why did you park way back there?
Okay, Troy!  Let's get those all-beef frozen patties!
You bet!
You dial nine to get out.
The hotel.
Thank you. Your father is a smart guy.
You don't look thirty-five.
I do alright.
See, my problem is, all I have are hundred dollar bills and I need something smaller.  Ones, fives, tens. Like that.
Oh, that would be wonderful!
Sir? I would really appreciate it if you wouldn't take the Lord's name in vain again.
Your father has a few final words for you. You know, he'd fight a buzz saw for you - he loves you so much. We both do.
No.
Oh, my God!
You got a light, honey?
So...you...survived the blast, did you?
Cheese is particularly troublesome.
Days??
The locks?
We have to be strong, sweetheart. If not for ourselves, for the child.
Burnt to a crisp.  I've given you the most well-done cut.
You have tranquilizers?
Yes!
What did you wish for, Adam?
In the generator room again?
Should we say a little prayer first?
Yes.
They've done a lot of re-building but society, at least as we knew it, has utterly collapsed. People throw up in the streets. Others point guns. There's something terribly wrong with the automobiles and...and I...I can't tell you the rest.  I just can't.
No, Calvin.  We're not going to make do.  Not me!  Not Adam.  We're going up no matter what!  We deserve it. Even if it's terrible!
How long will you set it for this time?
I forgot some of my stuff.
It means that your taste in men's apparel is as bad as your taste in men.
Well, what do you think?
Are you kidding?!  You wouldn't even be a crumb on her table!  You don't see that?!
Go to the bathroom.
What's that mean?
Hey, you're the psychic. Eve, the psychic pimp.  You tell me.
Where are you going?
Or pee in their pants when they see the ocean!
Or have perfect table manners.
What?
Where did he get all that information?
Gay.
What's wrong?
I don't know. I like to think so.
I'm selling this place.  I want out of this hell hole!
Buy it from me?
Tower. Wolf One. I've got a problem here.
I'm marking the 180 radial for five and ejecting.
Oh yeah? Have you seen any?
Well, I haven't seen any. I wouldn't worry about it. Look, I better go.
Suave. Goddam are you suave, you fucker. You want some beer?
Fuckin' good, real fuckin' good. You know this little tid bit, Dorothy, and this thing, here,  is a neighbor. What the shit we're doin' with a neighbor, I don't know. Goddam!!!  This is the suavest guy I know. Look at you. You're one beautiful fucker, Ben. I love this jacket and that cigarette holder of yours. Shit, that is too fuckin' much. Where's those glasses. This beer's gonna get too warm. I can't stand fuckin' warm beer. It makes me puke.
Yeah. I've got it here in this bag. I thought I should bring it to you.
Detective Williams here. Yeah. Tell him to go to Sergeant Milton. Yeah, copy.  Well, Jeffrey, you found something which is very interesting to us. Very interesting. I know you must be curious to know more.  But. I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you not only not to tell anyone about your find, but also not to ask more about the case. One day, when it's all sewed up, I'll let you know all the details. Right now, though, I can't.
These are beautiful. How's the case coming?
What is this? What color is it?
Jeffrey! Come on in.
Okay, come on in. Looks like you had a bad face lift.
Yes? What is it?
Jeffrey. Jeffrey what?
You tell me!! Let me see that wallet.  Jeffrey Beaumont. What're you doing in my apartment, Jeffrey Beaumont?
What? Are you kidding me? Who sent you here?
That's right. That's what I said. You have a good memory. Then what?
How many times have you sneaked into girls' apartments and watched them undress?
What do you want from me?
Do you like me?
Next Christmas. Is he Santa Claus who has left a present for Dorothy? What was it? An ear? Another ear?!!  What was it?
Don't say that.
Why are you here. Whatiya want?
I looked for you in my closet tonight.  It's crazy, I don't know where you came from, but I like you.
Oh God. Don!!! Why can't I just die.
Look.
Yes.
Come in.
It used to make me laugh, but.
Yes. Frank--
Do you like my body?
What do you want to do?
That wouldn't be too good, would it?
Okay. I know you've been scared. Now you want to scare someone.
Look, snap out of it, will ya?
I asked first.
Wait a minute. Wait. Whatiya want? For cryin' out loud!
I didn't mean to hurt you.
Who's this fuck?
We're looking for him. In your opinion, why did Frank kidnap Dorothy's son and husband?
Raymond! Where's the fuckin' beer?
Jeffrey, breakfast is ready.
No, you're right.
Looks like they've got you strapped in pretty good.
Are you feeling okay?
Good to see you, son.
Yeah, how did you know?
No. You're not bothering me. You a senior?
Come on, you brought it up. Do you know anything?
I guess you have to get back home soon?
That's the building. She lives on the Seventh Floor. Don't stop to look long, the police are watching.
Oh yeah. What about those other people? Anything?
You really do hear a lot, don't you?
I have to help out in my father's hardware store. They're giving me sort of my own hours for a while, which is nice.
What happened to him?
I don't want to cause any trouble.
Now, how are you going to do that?
Are you alright?
I was just about to go to the door, when that man did my job for me. Was it alright?
I owe you, since I goofed up this one.
Yes. I do.
I'll tell Mike I'm sick. There's a game tonight anyway and he'll never miss me. Afterwards he can go out with the guys. Just so the record is kept straight though, I love Mike. What do want me to do?
Here's to. An interesting experience.
Yeah, but.
That's for me to know and for you to find out. I'll see you. I mean call you, okay?
Twice. Without her sensing anything?
You're sure right. It is a strange world.
So are you.  I mean you're a neat guy. We better get back.
No, silly - I'm still in school you know. But I'll meet you after school and you can tell me what you've learned. You better be careful, Jeffrey.
Okay, be careful.
Nothing really, but it's interesting. They know each other. They seem to like each other.
You like mysteries that much?
You didn't tell him about me?
Really?
Probably not. No. Why?
I should go with her, Sandy.
Come on out a minute, okay?
Listen kid, I think you better understand who you're dealing with here.
There's ways around that.
Yes sir.
What the fuck are you doing here? What, huh!? WHAT? WHAT? WHAT? ANSWERS! I WANT FUCKIN' ANSWERS!
Anybody you think is evil?
Donna's gonna be angry about her cat.
I guess we really don't have a system of deciding who.
It's all your fault. Both you little bastards. I was a fool to believe you would bring me any peace. The day your Da left us when you were almost too young to remember, he said the two of you would do me right and make me proud, but he was wrong and I got nothin' ta live for.
Well, we tried ta make friends and she gave me a shot ta the nuts.
All right, love ya ma. Listen, before ya go just give us the goods, eh?
"Now, that wasn't too polite, was it?"
Where the fuck are you going?
Nine bodies.
He isn't to be touched.
Now, you will receive us.
Each day we will spill their blood till it rains down from the skies.
Only two did the shooting.  So what are you thinking, Russian retaliation?
Your what?! Your fuckin' what?!
Jesus. I just can't think anymore. That scene over at the coffee shop today tapped me out.
That's one big fuckin' shoe!... and think about it. Of all the ways to kill a guy, crushin' him to death. That's very particular. You don't get many of those. I dunno. I feel something big here. I wouldn't be surprised if we see more of these turning up.
While Greenly's getting coffee, anybody else want anything?
Uh.  Shit, I, uh...
Oh, she's quite proud of herself.
It's only 11:00 here boys so I got lot's more drinkin' ta do with your worthless relatives down at the Anvil.
Roc. You okay?
Hello?
No. You sure you're okay?
Hurry the fuck up!
Well he sure as fuck knew you!
You bet your ass he will.
Has he now?
I guess not.
You're right.
I want to stand for what I believe in, father.
The laws of God are higher than the laws of man.
Father, I'll do you right here.
Poppa Joe, you want me to go now?
Tell me a joke funny man. Hee Hee.
Making Hutch David Soul?
Plus where's Huggie Bear?
Why?
This is he?
Did you see what I meant about the window?
She's really kind of hot.
Anthony, we'll get two hundred for the coin collection alone. That's less than what it's appraised at.
How was I ridiculing you?
I don't think so. Just reach on in.
Holy shit. What'd I tell you?
Is it back in?
Is that the manager?
What about what that guy said?
You owe me fifty bucks.
Look, man. She didn't know anything about shirts.
Armored trucks are very difficult to steal, Anthony.
Inez, this is --
May I have a word with you, please?
Anthony, we're on the run from the law here. Did you tell these people your real name?
They don't?
Where was I?
If you wanted to go? What were you going to do? Just leave me here by myself?
If you'd gone with Bob you'd probably be in Weatherford by now. Of course I'd be here frantically worrying thinking you must of got kidnapped.
I have an idea for that.
She doesn't need to know.
Look. I'm ready to get the fuck out of here. It's real torture for me to be here. Getting the shit kicked out of me by Mexicans.
You gave $383 to the goddamn housekeeper! What the fuck is your problem?
That's what she is!
You could give somebody a concussion.
Dignan. Take it easy.
I don't know, Dignan. You went crazy.
OK. Man in blue jeans just left by southwest door. He is entering a white van. What time is it?
Do you like Inez?
What are you doing?
Wait for Kumar.
You're kidding.
You got to be kidding me.
How big is it?
Does it float?
I think I may have found a way out of here.
No. I'm not.
It's hard to get much spin with this kind of paddle.
And you're wrong if you think, I'd turn my back on a friend.
Congratulations. You passed the test.
Did Dignan take the test?
Are you afraid?
Future Man.
What do herbs have to do with it? I don't understand the --
Could you grow cinnamon?
You think he got my license plates?
Why not?
Well, because you guys don't look alike.
Yeah. Let's keep it --
You OK, Bob?
Yeah.
We think Mr. Henry maybe --
What?  What?
Yeah.
I can knock a man out with a six inch punch.
Mr. Henry pulled that job in 1965. It's famous. Applejack was the wheel man. Did you use this same car, Applejack?
Well, what do you think?
You stole a Trans-Am.
Six thousand dollars? Come on, Bob.
That's my responsibility.
He doesn't get it. Held never understand what we're trying to accomplish here. It's too dangerous for him.
What are you doing?
You can go first, Bob.
I don't think they can make it stick, Bob. I mean, what do they actually have on Future Man?
How long has he been in there?
Don't "Come on, Dignan" me.
Future Man would never go to jail for you, I'll tell you that.
I know it's not.
Hey, Dignan. How's it going?
Come on in. What you been up to?
It's too bad about what happened on the road.
Right. It was extremely stupid.
Come on, Bob.
Scarecrow?
Do you have your own room?
Do they let you --
Fancy seeing you here, Bob.
I know, Bob. You were on a secret mission.
How long do you have to go?
Oh, yeah.
You got to have fun with it. There's no point if you're not having any fun. Would you like me to be there tomorrow?
We're closed, sir.
Treadstone.
That's not gonna fly.
I want to know what happened.
So you had Conklin killed.  I mean, if we're cutting the crap...
Sit down.
Okay. What if someone decided to cover their tracks by blaming Conklin and Bourne. What if Bourne didn't have anything to do with this?
Sit. Can you...  [The chair. Have the chair.]
It doesn't matter. Your life is hard enough.
I should kill you... if it's true you should die... I should kill you now!
So why didn't you kill me then?
You're lying. If it's over, why are they after me?
What's going on in Berlin?
-- car keys?
Where were you, Jason? In the car.
I'll get the book.
I'm trying, Marie, Okay?
It's just a nightmare.
You are better. And I think it's not memories at all. It's just a dream you keep having over and over.
No... How?
But you're sure?
Where --
-- where's left to go? --
Switch! You drive!
If he crosses the bridge, it is.
See that tram coming around the corner?
I did... Jason, I swear, I did... I told them... I told them I believed you...
A Russian?
You left a print! There was Kel that didn't go off! There was a partial print, they tracked it back to Treadstone! They know it's you!
My first job.
That's a lie!
No... Jason... please...
Why am I alive?
You didn't answer my question.
We need to get in there.
-- so there were two of these explosive charges placed on the power lines. One of them failed. The fingerprint...  That's from the one that didn't go off.
Mr. Nevins?
Are you an expert in amnesia?
What do you think? Is he coming in?
Here's what I've got.  Remember Vladimir Neski? Russian politician? Seven years ago, he was due to speak to a group of European Oil ministers here at the hotel. He never did. He was murdered.
His wife. In room 645. Then she shot herself. 
What it means in England -- and in Scotland too -- is that rebels have forfeited their lands. We were ambushed last night. But the Scots dragged their dead away.
Sir William. We come to seek a meeting.
Young Robert, we are honored --
The weapon has been outlawed by the Pope himself!
So I did! And what was so important about it?
I am cheerful with a plan to soothe your miseries. All of England shudders with the news of renewed rebellion.
The Bruce is not coming, William.
Stephen ready?
I still say this is no test. A catapult can throw a stone farther than a man can.
All right, Father, I'll ask him!  If I risk my neck for you, will I get a chance to kill Englishmen?
I am the one who is rotting. But I think your face looks graver than mine.
So more men were slaughtered uselessly!
We must have alliance with England to prevail here. You achieved that! You saved your family, increased your lands! In time you will have all the power in Scotland!... Yet you grieve.
The Scottish nobles have sent him no support. His army starves. Our stall has worked, he must withdraw. You may return to your embroidery.
No. I have it to ease the suffering of the children of this war.
I'll invite you again, but your mother thinks I'm crazy.
Did God make you the sacker of peaceful cities? The executioner of the king's nephew, my husband's own cousin?
I understand you have suffered. I know... about your woman.
You have... you have a husband.
Wait! ...I respect what you said. But remember, these men have lands, castles. Much to risk.
No. But from top to bottom this country has no sense of itself. Its nobles share allegiance with England and its clans war with each other. If you make enemies on both sides of the border, you'll end up dead.
Then tell me what a king is! Is he a man who believes only what others believe? Is he one who calculates the numbers for and against him but never weighs the strength in your own heart? There is strength in you. I see it. I know it.
Who would do such a thing?
Thank you for showing it to me first. I'll... I'll take care of it. Can I have the picture?
And you say he doesn't remember any of it?
If I had to guess, I'd say the blackouts are stress related.
Darn it!
Now your father may seem sleepy to you, but that's just because of his medicine, okay?
I don't know. These things take time.
I found these. The others are still in storage.
What did you see? What did it look like?
Hello, Evan. It's very nice to meet you.  He's as handsome as his father.
Where are you now?
Go on. Nothing can hurt you. Remember, this is only a movie. You're completely safe.
Books?
Think Evan. You've invented a disease that doesn't exist. Alternate universes with colleges, prisons, paraplegia...
Get dressed, Thumper, you're taking me out for my birthday.
You really think he wanted to kill you?
I never wanted to be in the movie anyway and it was cold so I wanted to wear my clothes but Mr. Miller took his shirt off --
I'm sorry Kayleigh. This was a bad idea.
It's not your fault. Mrs. Kagan called dad and blamed us for what happened to Lenny.
Did your mom say if Lenny was... okay?
Welcome home. Thought you might like some fresh air for a change.
No, Evan. I don't know. It's been a long time. Fill me in.
When we were kids. Your dad was making a movie. Robin Hood or something?
It's just... did he... what happened in the basement?
I don't know what to say. It's beautiful.
It's my fault. I should have told you he was released a few weeks ago.
I can't put my finger on it, but everything's a bit off. Even the dinner tonight. It was beautiful, but...
What's happened to you?
Oh? There's proof now?
I just thought you should know.
Where are we going?
You know how spiritual he's gotten ever since he saved Mrs. Halpern and Katie.
Is something the matter?
I was?
I don't get it.
We're really gonna be in a movie!?
It's okay. I won't bite. You've seen pictures of me, right?
There is no "right". When you change who people are, you destroy who they were.
And you are...?
So what's the point?
That should buy you ten minutes at least.
Are you sure you even packed it?
No one thinks you're a piece of shit, Tommy.
Nothing. Just that my brother did a stint in the pen and he used to eat like that.
Evan, guess what? Dad got a new video camera and we're all gonna be in a movie.
Quit it, Tommy. Evan gets to be Robin Hood. I'm gonna be Maid Marian, and you're the Sheriff of Nottingham!
How did you get in here? You're under age.
Nobody ever loved me that much.
Monsieur Rick, I --
We read five times that you were killed in five different places.
Yes, I come.
But Sacha always puts out that light --
Hello, Rick.
That's too bad. That's Casablanca's leading commodity. In refugees alone we could make a fortune if you would work with me through the black market.
Suppose we ask Sam. Maybe he'd like to make a change.
That's why I came over here to give them a chance to ransack my place.
Don't forget, you owe Rick's a hundred cartons of American cigarettes.
And Mademoiselle?
Uh huh. Under a safe conduct from me.
It is possible the French authorities will find a reason to put him in the concentration camp here.
-- It was "La Belle Aurore."
Who are you really? And what were you before? What did you do and what did you think? Huh?
I'm willing to be overcharged. Tell me.
Yes?
My German's a little rusty.
Was that cannon fire, or is it my heart pounding?
But be serious, darling. You are in danger and you must leave Paris.
Yes, of course, we --
I didn't count the days.
Do I have to hear again what a great man your husband is? What an important cause he's fighting for?
Put them on the table.
Oh, you'll help him now, Richard, won't you? You'll see that he gets out? Then he'll have his work, all that he's been living for.
Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but soon, and for the rest of your life.
It's been a long time.
When will he be back?
Goodnight.
What happened with Rick?
Ask me?
Yes, Victor, I was.
No, Victor, there isn't.
Captain, the boy who is playing the piano, somewhere I have seen him.
Yes.
Well, isn't there some other place? It's rather confidential, what I have to say.
Don't you sometimes wonder if it's worth all this? I mean what you're fighting for?
Everything in order?
Yes.
Let us say that it is my request. That is a much more pleasant word.
Well! A precedent is being broken. Er, Emil!
That's strange. Nobody is supposed to sleep well in Casablanca.
I am afraid not. My regrets, Monsieur.
Monsieur, insofar as it is in my power --
This is hardly the time or the place.
Is that all you wish to tell us?
And what if you track down these men and kill them? What if you murdered all of us? From every corner of Europe, hundreds, thousands, would rise to take our places. Even Nazis can't kill that fast.
You may find the climate of Casablanca a trifle warm, Major.
Especially so tonight, Major. In a few minutes you will see the arrest of the man who murdered your couriers.
You repeat "Third Reich" as though you expected there to be others.
Rick is completely neutral about everything. And that takes in the field of women, too.
We are concerned about more than Casablanca. We know that every French province in Africa is honeycombed with traitors waiting for their chance, waiting, perhaps, for a leader.
The plane to Lisbon.  You would like to be on it?
Is that a serious offer?
Oh, laugh if you will, but I happen to be familiar with your record. Let me point out just two items. In 1935 you ran guns to Ethiopia. In 1936, you fought in Spain on the Loyalist side.
The winning side would have paid you much better.
That makes Rick a citizen of the world.
Well, Ricky. I'm very pleased with you. Now you're beginning to live like a Frenchman.
I see. How do I know you'll keep your end of the bargain?
Well, there are certain sections of New York, Major, that I wouldn't advise you to try to invade.
But think of all the poor devils who cannot meet Renault's price. I get it for them for half. Is that so parasitic?
Sam, Ferrari wants you to work for him at the Blue Parrot.
Well, I ain't sleepy either.
Boss, let's get out of here.
You played it for her and you can play it for me.
If she can stand it, I can. Play it!
It's bad.
Shit!  Shit!  Shit!
Can't.  Need water.
No.
No.
If they can't see you, what's the point?
Polaris, where are you?  Maybe I'm too far south.
You're putting off the inevitable.
Get water!
I float.  You sink.  End of story.
Our apologies that it never made it to the recipient.
You?  Personally?
Yeah, a long one.
Got to follow the paper path here.
Chuck.
I can't even keep fish alive.
No.
Chuck, you're breaking my heart.
I'm sorry... I'm sorry...
I got married.
Her name's Hannah.
What was inside?
That about sums it up.
So simple to say, so hard to do.
I've got to get back to Memphis. Hannah's babysitter has finals.
You're not out of Pascagoula, are you?
It seemed like she had such a good time last time.
Maybe I should take a few days off. Roger's working now, you could use some help around here...
The place is falling apart.
What a journey you've had.  It seems more than a person should have to bear.
Okay.  After three years the PTR reverts to tape storage, which is okay because we access it through the CPC.  Here it is.  Ten packages from the same sender.  Baku. Delhi.  St. Petersburg.  The guy was a real road warrior.  This package was Kuala Lampur.  No activity in his account after this package.  No forwarding addresses after K.L.
It is Ibrim, I, I am a sorter.
What do you expect, from the guy who stole a kid's bicycle when his truck broke down?
I didn't know we had sailboats.
Forget it.
You are one sick fucker.
God damn!  God damn!  Chuck, it's you!
I beat the odds!
What, then?
Permission to come aboard, sir.
They want to replace me! The Board of Trustees wants to *replace* me!
He is a goddamn psychiatrist--of *course* he wants to "help"! He'd be happy if he could help *commit* me!
These *credentials* are against the law!
He *smells* like he could put you to sleep!
I mean your parents.
Why not?
Daddy, it's a letter to *me*.
I've never seen a lobster.
I know.
Oh...
So. Not bored yet?
Aren't you worried that people will cut their feet?
Olive told me.  You might have told me yourself.
I grew up with Wally. I began my adult life with him.
No! That's not all there is to it! I love you, too--I *know* I do.
We should take her to St. Cloud's. That much is obvious, isn't it? Let her make up her mind when she gets there...
You don't understand! It's her father...
"...did." Well, okay.
I know you don't think much of being needed, or of me for that matter...
No, I'm the one who should be sorry. You have every right to be angry.
How is that Wally doing?
I've got some more clothes for you-- I just keep forgetting to bring them with me.
That's true.
Her temperature is a hundred and four.
Or that he can't be bothered to write us a proper letter? A dissertation on apples, we don't need!
Is *your* father dead?
But did you know him?
Don't get too excited, Fuzzy.
So, now, uh... you're not... I mean, do *you* do the--
They wouldn't take me. I'm Class IV-- I've got a heart defect.
Where are you going?
At what altitude?
What lousy luck--I mean your orders... to draw an assignment like that!
So. What should I do now?
It's big enough to keep you out of the war, I suppose. Ain't that right?
Cider don't have no taste till later in October--it's too watery now, when we're usin' just them early Macs and them Gravensteins. You don't get no *good* cider till you're pickin' them Golden Delicious and them Winter Bananas, them Baldwins and them Russerts...
I didn't see where you was pickin' this mornin', Homer, but you musta worked up a big appetite. You look like you're serious about gettin' to your lunch today!
I think you been stayin' up too late at night, Homer.
Ain't nobody havin' *sex* with my little girl, Homer--that's somethin' a father knows.
But she's your *daughter*...
What business is you in, Homer?
There was no visible wound?
It's obviously an aborticide.
Christ, it's oil of tansy!
If you take enough of it, your intestines lose their ability to absorb Vitamin C.
Fuzzy is not uncommon. I tell you, there's something about the premature babies of alcoholic mothers. They seem susceptible to every damn thing that comes along.
Okay, he's just a Wilbur then.
I thought you took care of this. It always breaks in the same place. It's your splice, isn't it?
I thought it was my turn.
Good-bye, Arthur.  Homer, I'll see you tomorrow?
Rose Rose?
There's a little something wrong with it. Just this part here--the right ventricle. It's slightly enlarged.
I'm not in trouble.
Who cares?
When the plane was hit, the crew chief and the radioman jumped close together. The copilot jumped third. All on Captain Worthington's orders-- the captain was still flying the plane. None of the men of the ground could see the sky--that's how thick the jungle was. They never saw the plane crash--they never *heard* it crash. They never saw Captain Worthington's parachute, either.
You all take care of yourself, too, Homer!
They're *outrageous*, them rules!
*What* view?
Don't let us make you nervous or nothin'--we know you gotta job to do.
I told him that you all is sick.
That sounds like you is in trouble already, Homer.
Where do you think you're going?
You just go inside, Homer. We don't need no help.
Rose Rose has runned away!
My name's Grant. Grant Ashby.
Right. The guys who started that did what a lot of companies in the Valley do. They get a good idea, shop it around, raise some capital, then sell it off to a bigger company. Microsoft, Intel, Oracle, whatever. The beauty of it is, they've pretty much sold the company before they're even real. The bigger company is already set to buy it, all they want to do is make sure that the idea actually works. So they get some start up capital, make it work, then sell it for like five times the initial loan.
Let's just slow down for a second...
Then there it is. Ashby gets the itch.
Same thing with playing a con. You have to be able to see that deep.
Yeah, but come on... All I get to do is cry and get insulted.
It can erase all those things about you that you wish didn't exist.
Grifters...
Keeping the Fix happy.
Like what?
She had you tempting fate.
Alright... Turn around. She doesn't get shit, unless I get that money. Where is it?
What are you? New? Let me tell you how good this guy is. Last night, Al calls this bookie to settle up. Apparently he's been ducking him for like a month. So the guy asks him where he's got all this money all of a sudden, right? What does Al do? Does he tell him that he cashed in a fucking Bar Mitzvah bond? Does he tell him he's been giving head out back for twenty bucks a pop? No... He starts going on about this job he just pulled and how he fleeced some Wall Street asshole-type... How HE fleeced.
Poor bastard never knew what hit him. Jesus, I almost felt sorry for the guy.
I'm going home
We only owe the King a hundred and fifty.
We meet him with corporate papers, inquiring about a corporate loan for start up capital. The corporate papers are in order, but we need things to happen fast. Our guy fudges numbers in the right places, moves our papers to the top of the pile or to the bottom, depending upon what we need.
She up for this?
You'll be there?
Jake --
Honest mistake. Just give me the money back and all will be forgiven.
Buddy, that was business. Besides, you have more crew. Then there's you...
Fucking grifters! I love it! You got balls, I'll give you that much.
How much?
That's more than you already owe me. What happens if you fuck this up?
Excuse me?
Look at you, you skinny prick.
Oh Jesus!
We're going to rope this banker tomorrow and you gotta at least look classy, if not be classy. You gotta do this thing and I don't even know if you can.
I'm your basic underachiever. Can't stand working and porn doesn't seem like a good option.
Who says you have to know the King to be in a hole? I actually did have a real job once. When I was in high school, I worked as a candy striper.
We were friends. I trusted him. I should have known it was weird. But, then again I was weird.
Shit, what was that guy's name? I really liked him.
You are such a raving pussy sometimes.
Everyone's working an angle, right?
What do you get, Lily? Finder's Fee? Because it is all about the money, right?
It's bad luck.
Why?
Uh...
Yeah, well we never had this kind of problem before.
Is it all fugasi?
Excuse me? I believe you're holding something far me under Pearson.
I'm sorry. Nothing under Pearson.
A ring for my wife. A lot like that one. In fact, it was that one.
I know it's policy, but...  The thing is... It's our first anniversary and we're only in town for the weekend. It's a very, very special night for my wife and I. This ring is my gift to her and I think she's going to really love it. I can give you phone numbers to call for people who'll vouch. I can send you I.D. later...
Exactly. 'Cept this Gillette guy. He gets to walk around in three piece suits, hob knob with the Mayor, own a bank, that kinda shit. Meanwhile, the King sits holed up in the steam, afraid to even take a leak without me or Harlin watching the door.
Your buddy. That fat guy. The King couldn't wait to have that guy whacked. He didn't even know who the guy was, but he was so pissed off at him, he gets him drilled. It ain't personal. It's business.
He's wheeling around two million dollars in cash and he wants to stop to use the bathroom. You believe this?
Hey, I been on the ramp all my life, so I got no problem with the way you help yourself, Jake.
Can't say.
The King? Jake, you play the heavy rackets like that... They put the lug on for nothing at all.
Preliminary forensics suggests he was sitting there, bloated and purple in his egg foo young for at least seventy two hours. Alfonse was not a small man and there was a lot of food ordered, so you can imagine the smell. Bad for the neighbors, good for me because in all the time I've been looking for Jake, this is only the second time I've even gotten a whiff of him.
You guys awake?
Who?
Don't be an idiot. How hard do you think it is to sell one drug dealer's drugs to another drug dealer? If Vig's right, we might be looking at a hundred, maybe a hundred fifty grand...
Hope so. Those fucking orthodontist bills are killing me. One fifty every time they tighten those bitches up. One fifty! It's not even covered.
You trust this Moonan guy?
Hi, Jack.  Welcome to the cesspit.
My car's in the garage.
I'll take you up on that.
I got scared.
I've been watching you work. You're the best in the place. But you know that.
Hi-ya... I'll call you back.  Now then...
She's a dab hand With a racquet, your friend.
A bit unexpected, wasn't it?
How's that football story corning along?
I couldn't resist them.
No, no. I'm not ready for you. There's some vodka in the freezer.
You really are a beautiful woman.
I had training. In the Republic.
I loved it blond.
This fucking job's getting to you. You haven't written a fucking word since you started.
You're my conscience.
What are you doing here?  You know the rules.
I don't finish till eight. Make it nine and you're on.
No.
For Christ's sake, Jacko, don't look a gift horse in the mouth. Have you written that name down? Reynolds, at the Golden Lion. 
Do you believe in astrology?
I'm in trouble.
They mean it.
You don't have to be criminal. A man will come up to your table and deliberately cheat. You'll see him, stop him, and the guy will make a big scene. There'll be chaos. And that's when it'll happen.
What'll you do when it all goes wrong?
Next time it'll be my neck.
Did they tell you to sleep with me?
Yes.
And your hand too.
Hello...
Did you solve your problems?
Where do you live, Jack?
Look Matt, there's something I have to say to you. I saw you cheating.
What are you, a cop?
And the girls?
I'm off. I need to sleep.
What? You know what happened to me, don't you? That bitch Bella shopped me. I'd like to beat the shit out of her.
I'm sorry, sir, that's a late bet.
David Reynolds, I'm the Manager here. Sit down, John.
Haven't you forgotten something?
This isn't South Africa. We'd know, because someone would report it. Believe me, someone always does.
This is our Crow's Nest. I'm showing it to you now, but you'll never see it again.
I just want the job.
Why don't you take a break, Jack.
I'm not sure. I think something is fucked up somewhere in the ship, though.
No, no, the key, the key to the fail- safe lock!
Where's the fail-safe key?
Why doesn't Talby ever eat down here with the rest of us?
Thanks.
Do you remember the detonation time?
Hello, bomb, are you with me?
Well of course I exist.
My sensory apparatus reveals it to me.
Now, bomb, consider this next question, very carefully. What is your one purpose in life?
So you have no absolute proof that Sergeant Pinback ordered you to detonate.
Yes, of course you remember it, but what you are remembering is merely a series of electrical impulses which you now realize have no necessary connection with outside reality.
...you may be doing so on the basis of false data.
Pinback...
Must get lonely being up here so much.
Waves would be peaking really high and glassy. Hit that water. Ridin' the wall just perfect.
Ah, Doolittle, I do have a malfunction on this readout, but I can't seem to pinpoint exactly where it is.
I really think I should try and locate it immediately. Might be something important.
It is, Doolittle, it's the Phoenix! They glow with all the colors of the rainbow, just like everybody said.
Commander, sir, we have a big problem. You see, the Veil Nebula bomb, Bomb Number 20, is stuck. It won't drop from the bomb bay. It refuses to listen and plans to detonate in --  -- less than eleven minutes.
What were you saying, Commander, about the bomb?
Look, that thing about the pliers, I was just doing what the man pays me to do. Ya know?  Comin' off hard.
Security camera got you coming outta the stairwell, weapon in your hand, going to room one-oh-four and greasing the patient.  It's embarrassing to the professional community, is what it is.
How're ya doin', Max.
Trying to have a relationship with you, Max, is like standing in a fog bank.  You know you're in the middle of something only you have absolutely no idea where you are.
What are you doing here?
Nobody there to sign for it, mon.  What's a bruddah s'posed to do, ride around all day with the damn package?
I'll give you seventy-five bucks for it.
I shouldn't do this.  But I got a client lookin' to score some fire power.  Maybe you'll keep your eyes open for me.
He's a mistake I made about six months before you did.  But don't feel bad. Justine made the same mistake, along with Renee, Jada, Tia, Brooke--
What a creep.
You didn't...
Oh my God!  In here!  IN HERE!
What else can we do?
I know, Honey, but just think how exiting it will be-- new house, new school, new friends--
No...
I was expecting someone else.
You have good taste.  French, 1920's, attributed to Chitarus.
Who is...
Girlfriend?
So what are you gonna do about it?
Personally, I'm more interested in going fast on my motorcycle or climbing the Trans American building with my pals. Instead of giving myself a headache over stuff I can't do anything about.
Gold leaf, art nouveau, French, early nineteen hundreds... I could probably fence this for three or four grand.
I don't know what kind of game you're playing here but I'm out because you are a whack-job.
Your basic hodge-podge.
Christmas is a snap when you got no parents or relatives, just a bunch of gene sequences from probably twenty different people.
That's low, but this effects me how exactly?
They've lost track of me and I plan to keep it that way.
See you're back and still rocking the boat.
I would've come sooner, but...I didn't... How're you doin'?
What's this?
These girls, kidnapped during the last month and sold overseas to the highest bidder.  The oldest is twelve.  The youngest about the same age you were when you escaped.
I'm looking for a lady who works here.
Max something.  I got no clue where she stays.
Who is it?
Look, I don't know what you want--
You drive away business roarin' in like that.
I got a hit on the car.  An oh-five Tahoe, blue, with Wyoming tags... AGT349... It wasn't easy 'cause you were off in one of the numbers.
Guy says he made the trade in Gillette, Wyoming sometime in the fall of oh-nine.
Then what?  That's it.  That's all I got.
She was a nurse.  She must've lived near there, somewhere, near the...  ...the clinic.  There must be some registry of nurses or medical technicians or whatever for Wyoming.
I need a favor... I need you to trace a number for me.
Zero... C'mon, Dan I don't have all day.
Morning, Sunshine...
Now, why can't I find a girlfriend like that?  Brings him lunch everyday, thoughtful, sweet, legs from here to there--
That's odd...
Tell me the truth.  Am I a female fog bank?
A little what?
A long time.
Gotta go.
Not right now.
And she bought that?
It's payday, need me to pick up your check?
Probably a touch of what's going around.
I don't see how you cheating on Natalie involves me.
And you were a sympathetic ear.
Convinced her she needed to visit her mom in San Mateo.
She came by the apartment once already. Fortunately, I'd disconnected the doorbell as a precaution... Lydia's not gonna back off until she gets her pound of flesh.
Max, what did I do to deserve a friend like you?
Fourteen-thirteen Market.  Get a signature, then take it to this address... By the way, that guy who was in here sniffing after you yesterday called twice already.
Huh?
No, I mean... you love your son?
Jeremiah?
I didn't mean for that to be so... intense. Forgive me.
So. Is it true that Gene Simmons had a cow's tongue grafted onto his real one? Y'know, to make it so long?
Ann Arbor isn't... that far from Cleveland, right?
We are not stealing my mom's car.
Sunday, but...
Very funny, Hawk. Okay, I'm in on this hare-brained scheme, but if anything happens to my mom's car, I'm blaming you. I'll say you drugged me or something.
Ok, dudes, follow my lead.
We got you a change of duds when we picked up the car.
What the fuck!
Now listen up. Here's the game plan.
Okay, one of us sneaks in, gets four ticket stubs off some kids in the audience, comes back out, and we all "re-enter" the concerto. Voila!
Where the hell am I gonna scare up that kinda gravy in one hour?
They're still at my house in Trip's jacket.
Oh no, Jam. I'm not falling for that twice.
I got...
They're not idiots.
What?!
So, you see if it wasn't for me, me and my friends would be at that KISS concert right now... together.
I was insulted, so I asked her if I was wreaking some wicked b.o., right? Then she said no, she wanted to take a bath with me.
Yeah, right. She wishes. Look at that big ass.
Hey, take it easy, man. This is the girls' crapper, remember?
I did it! I did it! We won!
Simplicity, Hawk.
Well, here we are back at fucking school again.
It's gone.
Please sir, don't beat me up. I do have a KISS ticket, but not on me.
What do you want?
Oh, yeah! You and what army?
I don't even think you have a gun!
Yeeeehaaawww!! This is totally fuckin' curly, man! Thank you God!
Are you AFRAID?
A wormhole with an Einstein-Rosen bridge, which is, theoretically... a wormhole in space controlled by man.
Each vessel travels along a vector path through space-time... along its centre of gravity.
DARKO CHEATS DEATH! Man... you're famous! I called you, like, a jillion times last night!
What'd you do, Donnie? What'd you do!
Oh, I... have those too.  What kind of problems does your dad have?
The best thing about soap is that it's the only thing on earth that can never get dirty. No matter what crap you throw on it... it always rubs off. And there it is again... perfect.
Babies cry because they're afraid of the dark. And because they have no memories... for all they know... every night could be the last forever. Like, perpetual darkness.
Well...
They suspended me for two days.
My mom is gone.
I don't know. She didn't leave a note. The house is all messed up.
Know what?
Oh, shit!
So... will Donnie find his Cellar Door?
Your mother said that you've been skipping cycles of your medication.
Follow him where?
So, tell me about your day, Donald.
Nothing.
Yes. I went to jail.
Hungry Hungry Hippos.
Regret.
How is that possible?
I can see him right now!
Your medication. They're placebos. Just pills made out of water.
Whoa, Elizabeth. A little hostile, there. Maybe you should be the one in therapy. Then Mom and Dad can pay someone two hundred dollars an hour to listen to all of your thoughts... so we won't have to.
What's her name?
Thank you for seeing us... We... just felt that it was time to discuss...
Has your son ever told you about Frank?
If that's what you think is necessary.
I haven't been accepted yet, mother.
How did this happen?
Do you even know who Graham Greene is?
Rose... I have to appear at his arraignment tomorrow morning. And as you know, the girls also leave for Los Angeles tomorrow morning. Now, as their coach... I was the obvious choice to chaperone them on the trip.
Yes. And believe me, of all the other mothers I would never dream of asking you, given the predicament with your son. But none of the other mothers are able to go.
What is this shit?
We got eggs, water balloons, and a dozen rolls of toilet paper.
Mommmm! I'll be right behind you in the hearse!
So, what do I say?
Hell-no, she ain't quittin'.
Oh, shut up. I thought it might help you get some sleep.
Oh, Mom's okay. They're just givin' her a ride back. She almost blew outta the back of Loretta's pick-up on the way over.
What is wrong with you?
It's all the stuff I get to do. Oh my God, oh my God... Okay, okay... We get a "personal consultation" with a make-up artist -- Eeeh! Okay, um, there'll be a choreographer to the stars and, oh no -- No way. Oh... My... God!
I'll be stayin' overnight at... The Airport Howard Johnsons!
Oh c'mon, I love 'em, but you know they only had me 'cause Peter needed a kidney.
I'm gonna need more caps.
Ow!
Bye mom.
This, this... This is bullshit!
What?
If you're gettin' at somethin', you better just say it.
So, anyone talk to Janelle?
It's just the guys that are... you know, makin' the movie about the pageant. I told you about 'em.
Annette, just use your hand.
That bitch from...
And the year before that?
Can you remember the theme of your favorite pageant?
What a surprise. Gladys Leeman's finally gonna go to State. And she'll probably ride on Becky's ass all the way to Nationals, too.
Hey, Ted, sorry. I didn't know your family was in the garage when I set it on fire!
Well, you know, I think everyone's doing really well considering the fact that she was so young.
So, remember the three most important parts of a good interview...
This is -- what?
Oh, I almost forgot...  I got my acceptance to Tokyo University.
That's not right yet... put back "President" and take out "dear"... How does it read now?
Eureka Ammunition Company -- Gentlemen -- Your shipment of sailor hats arrived this morning by freight --  Gloria, I could go for you in a big way --  However, the rifles you sent were a little rusty --  -- and I don't say that to everybody --  Have not received last month's drawing account.  How come?  Your neck is like a swan...  Yours very truly.  Now read it back. 
Well - what is he now?
What do you whistle?
Sure.  How much does the job pay?  Sure, if there's a chance for advancement.
What other job you got?
My card.
Why wasn't I insulted?
You no gotta no gun.
Late again, eh?  You haven't been on time once since this war started...  Get out there and fight... 
Well, we'll let that one go.  Now -- how many battalions you got?
Not a bad idea.  If our horses get tired they can ride your men for a change.  Now, I don't mind letting you have our horses, but you must promise to put them through their maneuvers.
Fine.  We'll throw in the matches before we make the delivery.  By the way, how're you fixed for spys?
If we should choose to chew, we'll be pursued -
You keep that up and you'll crab the whole war.
Are you sure you're not tired?
I'll keep the greetings -- but you can send back the good will... what we need right now is twenty million dollars.
I'll tell you what I'll do.  I'll give you Mrs. Teasdale as security.  or my jackknife.  If you want my advice, you'll take the jackknife... I've a better proposition...  Make it $25 and I'll give you a first mortgage on my son and I hope you foreclose.
When you get through with her feet, you can start on mine.  I haven't been to a chiropodist in two years...  If that's not an insult, I don't know what is.  Gloria, I love you.  I --
Oh yes! -- UPSTART!
You've made a wonderful impression. Your views are liberal... It is easy to see you have an open mind.
Guard them with your life... don't leave them out of your sight...  If the enemy gets those papers  we're lost.  If they don't get them, we're lost.  Can't you see what I'm trying to tell you?  I love you...   Mrs. Teasdale, you're the salt of the earth.  They don't come any better than you...
Your uncle has been such a friend to us in every crisis.  Without his country's financial aid --
Gentlemen!  Gentlemen!
Oh yes. You have so many nice things, and so much room.
Oh... why Mr. Merrick she's beautiful.
You won't be long?
Did it go well, darling?
What are you going to do?
What did you do to him? He's been like this all night!
Pull the other one, why don't you! We made a deal!
You think you're better 'n me? YOU wanted the freak to show all your doctor chums and make a name for yourself, you guv. So I gave him to you. On trust, in the name of science! And now I want him back.
A hospital is no place for secrecy, Mr. Treves. Doctors spiriting hooded figures about are liable to cause comment. Why wasn't this patient properly admitted, and why is he in isolation? Is he contagious?
Why isn't he in the General Ward, then?
A few words? I thought he was imbecile?
It's only a physical problem. He has trouble with certain sounds because of the constrictive deformity of the mouth. But he can talk, and has a great eagerness to make contact with people who will let him. So if you have any difficulty understanding what he is saying, just tell me and I'll make it clear.
...As I said, it's only a physical problem... but I do feel that Mr. Merrick is very flattered that you're taking the time and trouble to meet him, and he's most anxious to make a good impression, so he might seem rather nervous.
It was a nice try, Treves, but the man is so obviously mouthing your words.
Treves. Well done.
You are quite right, Treves, this is an exceptional case. And I quite agree that the committee should see Mr. Merrick.
Excellent. We shall present them, along with the other particulars of the case to the committee. I want them to see, exactly, how horribly his body has been affected. You and I shall vouch for his inner qualities.
Don't you think this is a bit premature? We don't have the backing yet to...
...everyone has been very kind.
What is it, Treves?
How long has this man been here?
Good Lord, Freddie! What have you got in there?
Fair Katharine, and most fair, will you vouchsafe to teach a soldier terms Such as will enter at a lady's ear And plead his love-suit to her gentle heart?
What say you, fair one? That the tongues of men are full of deceits?
Oh, no.
I want you to know that I don't go about giving my pictures to just anyone.
Alas, no.
How awful for John.
You alright?
Want to come out?
Of course! You want out?
The... oh, the spire! How silly of me, it's as plain as day... Mr. Merrick, where did you learn to do this?
Yyyy... Yyye... yyyess.
My... name is...
Mmmerrick.
Mmmerrick.
Righteousness for his namesake.
...Yes potatoes... but...
This... is my new home?
John... what's the matter? John... why are you upset?
The Children. Where are your children
Mr. Treves, there is something I've been meaning to ask you for some time...
The cathedral is coming along nicely.
My home.
A dressing bag?
Well...
YOU BASTARD! You tortured him. YOU TORTURED HIM, you bastard. WHERE is HE?
I'd pay handsomely for a private showing. Are you the proprietor?
There is no magic, Father... My mother had no magic...
It's your fantasy...
It's all right! It isn't happening!
How d'you KNOW we're "friends"?
What was she like?
But you LOVED her all the same...
That's just what I was trying to tell you. You ARE...
Just give me a hand.
YOU still want to go to Asgaard?
Erik! You've done what you came to do!
I don't want to live WITHOUT you.
But... How is it you can see me?  You can all see me?
How do we know this is the way?
What do you see, Erik?
Have you ever seen the sun, Erik?
Well, OBVIOUSLY there's no killing.
What's the matter, don't you WANT to hear our singing?
You don't think our singing's going to be good enough for you?
Really.
No.
The Gods are asleep, King Arnulf.
I'll tell you what...
Have you done this sort of thing before?
It's obvious you haven't raped anyone in your life.
No. It isn't rape then, is it?
I've come to take you back to the land of the living.
Have you tried to ask the God for anything?
What are you talking about?
Erik! Row! What are you doing?
Halfdan the Black's here!
We're missing all the fun...
You talking piffle, son?
Faster!
Look, the sky is blue...
Wait, Erik!
Don't you see, Erik! She wants revenge!
I AM one, Dad!
Bye, Leif.
You don't need to feel bad about being sea-sick, you know.
I know. I know.
He used to puke in his sleep.
And a sort of slightly sick feeling?
Let me go, Sven.
What?
If this IS the Age of Ragnarok, Keitel Blacksmith, it is GOOD to us.
My brother blacksmiths!
Shut up!
We're being attacked! KILL! Kill! Kill!
HOLD it! HOLD it in!
Well, of course he is!
He drove me mad!
He's not in Valhalla! He died of old age!
Thorfinn! You can't die!
You'll see my grandfather in Valhalla!
And something to sharpen them with?
Who was the girl you walked off with?
May I help you?
How are you today?
You rat.
Come up to Boston with me?
Now. Now! I have to go now. I have to see the frozen Charles! Now! Tonight!
I'm so excited. Yay!
I didn't have a chance to wrap it.
What's wrong with me?
Well, I've been having a bad time of it with um, my boyfriend, I guess.
Really?
It's okay, really.
Rockville Center.
-- because I go there all the time. I don't think I ever saw you before.
I don't really know how --
I'm sure you would.
No jokes about my name? Oh, you wouldn't do that; you're trying to be nice.
Yeah. Although it hardly fits. I'm a vindictive little bitch, truth be told.
Why wouldn't you think that about me?
I don't need nice. I don't need myself to be it and I don't need anyone else to be it at me.
Oh, okay. Well, sure, I'll just...  Take care, then.
You're sure? It's cold.
I'm not a stalker.
Take care.
Ready for another?
Me neither. But sometimes I have premonitions, so, I don't know. Maybe that's just coincidence. Right? Y'know, you think something and then it happens, or you think a word and then someone says it? Y'know?
I'm nervous. You don't need to be nervous around me, though. I like you. Do you think I'm repulsively fat?
That made me cry. But, anyway, we went up to Boston, because I had this urge to lie on my back on the Charles River. It gets frozen this time of year.
So, I enjoyed meeting you.
Yeah.
How could she have done this to me? How could anyone do this to anyone?
I can't believe you wrecked my car. You're driving drunk. It's pathetic.
You can't fucking say something like that and say you don't want to talk about it!
You're drunk.
More?
You know, we're okay. They're not finding us. You'll remember me in the morning. And you'll come to me and tell me about us and we'll start over.
He stole a pair of your panties while you were being erased!
But can't you see... I love you, Antoine.
Yeah.
I thought I was foolish. I thought I'd mistaken infatuation for love. You said:
I dropped you off after. You said --
It's very late.
I didn't think you'd show your face around me again. I figured you were humiliated. You did run away, after all.
Well, you're married.
I had you pegged, didn't I?
Hi there.
You know what I did.
Oh God, how horrid.
No, I stopped. I didn't want to feel like I was being artificially modulated.
Have you ever read any Anna Akhmatova?
I think, before.
I wish we did. You married?
Bye, Joel.
Have sex. Y'know --
Well, sounds like me. Sorry, man.  Says you were jealous and suspicious.
Says you were constantly calling me a slob.  It's sexy that we were like a married couple, griping and overly-familiar and bored. Don't you think?
You must have been crazy.
I know. I had to take the day to think.
Clementine.
Clementine.
We can help you through this. Why don't you start now by telling me everything you can remember about --
Yours?
Naomi, I really value our relationship. I hope it's possible for us to stay in touch.
Bullshit. Who is it? You met someone.
Hi.
How was it?
Say hi to Rob and Carrie. Have some fun!
Oh, sweetie. It really does cut both ways. We were taking each other for granted and --
So I'm going to get some sleep. I'm glad you're okay.
Oh, Patrick, you didn't want any, did you?
It's just... y'know... I mean...
Nietzsche. Beyond Good and Evil. Found it my Bartletts.
It's stopped.
I don't know what to do! I don't know what to do! Crap. Crap...
He's coming?
Hey.
Oh.
I know what it is.
Mary, people come to him voluntarily.
Yeah, yeah it is, Howard. And here I was thinking I could tell you something you didn't know.
I've loved you for a very long time. I'm sorry! I shouldn't have said that.
You made me have you erased! I loved you. I love you! How could you --
You get some sleep, Howard. I'll take it from here.
Howard, they've disappeared again.
I'll go out for a smoke. If no one minds.
Oh, hi.
I think he's in a conference. Unfortunately. I'm really sorry.
This book -- It's essential that people read it because --  -- It's the truth. And only I know it.
I like Mary. I like when she comes to visit. I just don't think she likes me.
What's your bartlett's?
The Clockworks is one reason that I am here on Siwash Ridge. I accepted the invitation to be initiated as a shaman by an aged Siwash chief who was the principle outside confederate of the Clock People.
What do you believe in then?
Suppose that you bear five or six children with your characteristics. All in Siwash Cave. In a postcatastrophe world, your offspring would of necessity intermarry, forming in time a tribe. A tribe every member of which had giant thumbs. A tribe of Big Thumbs would relate to the environment in very special ways. It could not use weapons or produce sophisticated tools. It would have to rely on its wits and its senses. It would have to live with animals -- and plants! -- as virtual equals. It's extremely pleasant to me to think about a tribe of physical eccentrics living peacefully with animals and plants, learning their languages, perhaps, and paying them the respect they deserve.
Welcome, podner. By God, it's great to have you here. It's an honor. Sorry I took so long getting to you, but we've had a mess of hard work these past few days -- and a heap of planning to do.
Tell me about it.
You're political, then?
What do you think?
What do they do to you boys in those Ivy league schools, anyway? Strap you down and pump the Nature out of you? They can even press the last drop of Nature out of a Mohawk buck. Why, send a shaman or cannibal to Yale for four years and all he'd be fit for would be a desk in the military-industrial complex and a seat in the third row at a Neil Simon comedy. Jesus H.M.S. Christ! If Harvard or Princeton could get hold of the Chink for a couple of semesters they'd turn him into a candidate for the Bow Tie Wing of the Hall of Wimps. Oogie boogie.
That's the very first time in the eons that I've known you that I've ever heard you complain. And now you're tired, poor darling.
You were the Yoni Yum girl from, let's see,  from nineteen sixty-eight through nineteen seventy. You've always smelled so nice. Like a little sister. The irony has just killed me. You, the Dew Girl, one of the few girls who doesn't need Dew. I loath the stink of females! They are so sweet the way God made them, then they start fooling around with men and soon they're stinking. Like rotten mushrooms, like an excessively chlorinated swimming pool, like a tuna fish's retirement party. They all stink. From the Queen of England to Bonanza Jellybean, they stink.
You still need the rope? I thought you were one a those spacemen with ice in ya veins.
Shit! Do not do that! Where the fuck are you?
Okay, listen up. As you all know by now, we have an addition to our crew. Dr. Weir, this is: Starck, navigation; Smith, pilot, Justin, ship's engineer --
...cancel our leave and send us out on some bullshit mission...!
From what?
Captain Miller, we're ready to repressurize the Clark.
What?
It's holding... She's holding...!
Damn, Dr. Weir, don't scare us like that. Coffee?
Coffee.
The Event Horizon only had life support for eighteen months. It seems impossible, but in light of the transmission... I have to think that someone has managed to endure until now.
I don't know what happened to Justin.
What you saw could have been an optical effect caused by gravitational distortion.
Can you shut it down?
How is he?
I, I tried to go back for him, to save him, but I couldn't get to him in time. The fire... Have you ever seen fire in zero-gravity? It's like a liquid, it slides over everything. It was like a wave breaking over him, a wave of fire. And then he was gone.  I never told anyone until now. But this ship knew, DJ. It knows about the Goliath, it knows about Corrick. It knows our secrets. It knows what we're afraid of.  And now you're going to tell me it's carbon dioxide.
What is it?
Please... kill...
What's happening...?
You've reached the First Containment Seal. The engineering decks are on the other side.
Justin, finish your sweep.
...I don't want to die...!
Since the initial transmission, there's been no further contact. Just the beacon, every two minutes.
What's the hold up?
Can anybody hear me...
I can run the image through a series of filters, try to clean it up.
Dr. Weir, I need you on the bridge.
I can see that, what're they for?
No one?
What could cause them?  What's in the Core?
If it worked.
It's 2041...
That's bullshit and you know it! You built this fucking ship and all I've heard from you is bullshit!
To what? Where did this ship go? Where did you send it?
I told you... She won't let you leave...
If you miss me, you'll blow out the hull. You'll die too.
You want me to believe you're the Devil, well, I don't, that's bullshit!
You can't have them. Go to hell.
1500 meters. We're getting too close...
Captain Miller...
Sir.
I didn't say that, I said the bio- readings correspond to what happened to you, the ship is reacting to us...
If you knew it was impossible, then why'd you waste my time?
I'm on my way, Starck.
Weir can't be alive.
Weir activated the drive. He's sending us to the Other Place.
Weir.
First time in a grav couch?
No. I saw nothing.
There's no one in the corridor but us.
He's engaged the override.
You got any coffee?
30 hours to Neptune orbit.
What is it?
What are you doing?
Justin said something about, "The dark inside me..." What did he mean?
I'm not really dressed for a party.
Those yours too?
You look like an eighties rock band.
He didn't mean it. You know Johnny. He's always been a hothead --
What are you doing here?
What do you want, Vic?
He couldn't generate enough power for the machine to reach critical mass. Yet another mistake for "Mr. Fantastic."
Oh my G-g-g. What did you... do to Ben?
Maybe you should think about yourself for once. You always let this guy push you round --
Can't do it. I cannot do it.
They crashed it into a wall. A flight simulator.
When have I asked you to do something you absolutely said you could not do?
The shields on the station should protect us.
He's smart, powerful, successful --
What the --!
You got a chisel round here?
Ben --
We're working as hard as we can --
Please tell me your dawg's not trying to rekindle things with my sister.
What's wrong with me?
They said that's not such a good idea, the shock alone could --
And where do we think we're going?
I though we went over this.
You're on fire!
This is wrong in so many ways.
What is that thing?
Get me on the AM shows, Larry King, cover of the Journal...  I've got to do something about this scar. Make sure they only shoot my right side.
Sir, I've always wondered... Why Sue? You could have any woman in the world but --
Those solar winds are flaring, but I factored them into my coordinates and --
Well, uh, based on our history... you can handle the biogenetics, and I'll focus on the molecular physics. Or, uhm, maybe I should take the biotech, you work the microscopes, since you have some background in electropho--
As far as crew, I was hoping Ben could pilot the mission --
Material made from self-regulating unstable molecules. I've been working on a formula for this.
I mean, you broke up with me, right?
I could get Ben to tap into the Baxter's main power to generate enough voltage --
When I walked out, I waited ten minutes outside your door. Ten. Waiting for you to come find me.
I can... make it work.
The power... I need... more power... to control... the storm --
Got it. So take a walk, Ben... I'm going to borrow Susan for a second.
Ben's still out there --
Just a little banged up. A couple scrapes. Why?
But I'm not done with the machine --
It's been a good two years, Victor... The company's accomplished so much.
He's working round the clock. But the data needs to be tested, analyzed before --
Reed's gonna fix me up --
Oh, man, if you could swing something there, I'd do anything for you. I want to work with you guys.
Man, I don't even want to see those guys from Carl's again.
Come on, Hamilton. You're going over there to represent Captain Kidd Fish and Chips. We have stores all over Southern California. Part of our image, part of our appeal is in our uniforms. You know that!
Well, I believe you have to fill out a form. There's a pad right around here.
Well, that's not the way it works, really. And you ate most of your food already, too...
I can't do that. But if you wait a minute...
Brad! Have Mom or Dad seen this?
Brad, what would you say if I asked you to just put these flowers in the trunk of the Cruising Vessel and get rid of them at work?
Hey, Brad. Are you still a virgin?
Since when do you shop at the Flea Market anyway?
Did you threaten this customer or use profanity in any way?
Leave me alone.
Nice to meet you, Stacy.
Well, that's exactly why I brought some Wisk for the jacuzzi.
I can't wait until I can drive next year. I walk every day. It's such a drag.
You know Mark Ratner really likes you. You like him?
Do you have any ice tea?
Aren't you curious to see how your class picture turned out?
Mike! You have a mess on C-9!
You... are a wuss. Part wimp. Part pussy.
It's definitely your mama.
All right... where did you see her?
Did you get her name?
Hey, Rat.
I come for the seafood. It's great! Hey... you know what, Mark? I found your wallet the other day. You want it back?
Well, I've gotta be running.
Poor guy.
If you ask me, she's pretty aggressive. You understand what I'm saying?
She wasn't really your girlfriend anyway.
And... you can only tell it's the right girl if you're sensitive.
What's going through your mind right here, Jeff? The danger of it all?
He is.
No there are variables that, like, I might not be good at.
You'll always remember your first time.
So tell me, do you like Ron? Is it serious?
Does Doug care that you're seventeen?
I guess Ron hasn't called yet.
Does that ever happen?
How long does Doug take?
Stacy! I've got water in my ears. Do you have any Q-Tips?
What do you think it is?
I really thought he would show up. I waited... and waited... and waited...
Don't do anything, Linda. I'd rather just forget about it. I don't even like the guy.
Not coming? What happened?
Mr. Spicoli?
I don't know, mon. The food lines took forever.
Am I hallucinating here? Just what in the hell do you think you're doing?
Now, Mr. Spicoli, comes a rare moment for me. Now I have the unique pleasure of squaring our account. Tonight, you and I are going to talk in great detail about the Davis Agreement, all the associated treaties, and the American Revolution in particular. Now if you can just turn to Chapter 47 of Lord of Truth And Liberty.
Well, you'll find out next year.
Don't worry, Spicoli. You'll probably squeak by.
Aloha, Mr. Hand!
Thanks for picking me up.
Where do you feel like going?
It's very warm out tonight.
You keep them.
What's your other question?
Do you mind if I excuse myself for a moment?
Sure. I'll... have another Coke.
Aren't your parents asleep?
Where's your brother?
So... pretty nice house you've got here.
What's April 16th?
Let's have lunch!
Of course, I could hear what the Clerk was really saying...
What's the message? My light is blinking.
Mr. Duke? Hello, Mr. Duke, I'm sorry we were cut off a moment ago... I thought I should call again, because I was wondering...
They're everywhere. Nobody's safe. And sure as hell not in the South. They like warm weather... You'd never believe it. In L.A. it's out of control. First it was drugs, now it's witchcraft.
Naked!?
Cut their goddamn heads off. Every one of them. That's what we're doing in California.
I'm a whiskey man myself. We don't have much trouble from drugs where I come from...
Hell, I really hate to hear this. Because everything that happens in California seems to get down our way, sooner or later. Mostly Atlanta. But that was back when the goddamn bastards were peaceful. All we had to do was to keep 'em under surveillance. They didn't roam around much... But now Jesus, it seems nobody's safe.
I want you to understand that this man at the wheel is my attorney! He's not just some dingbat I found on the Strip. He's a foreigner. I think he's probably Samoan. But it doesn't matter, does it? Are you prejudiced?
Thanks for the ride. Thanks a lot. I like you guys. Don't worry about me.
I tell you, my man. This is the American Dream in action! We'd be fools not to ride this strange torpedo all the way to the end.
We won't make the nut unless we have unlimited credit.
Two Cuba Libres with beer and mescal on the side.  Who's Lacerda, he's waiting for us in a room on the twelfth floor?
Why?
Jesus creeping shit!
Some angry Rotarian shoves you and you think: What's happening here? What's going on? Then you hear yourself mumbling.
That's what gives me The Fear.
I have to go.
When does this thing stop?
Did you see that? Some sonofabitch kicked me in the back.
Don't kid yourself. That Portuguese son of a bitch is dangerous. He's watching us like a hawk.
The cops?
You filthy bastard. I should cave your fucking head in.
What?... What kind of goddamn monster are you?
Man, I know these people in my goddamn blood!
What could they do? The guy that took the head was about six-seven, and maybe three-hundred pounds. He was packing two Lugers, and the others had M-16s.
What is this?
Adrenochrome...
Man, your head would swell up like a watermelon, you'd probably gain about a hundred pounds in two hours...
Alright, Alice... you'll be contacted by Inspector Rock. Arthur Rock. He'll be posing as a politician.
Fuck the car. They should make these things with a goddamn FM radio.
What made you do it? Who paid you off?
Maybe she's telling the truth. Maybe she's not part of it.
You realize...
Okay. Here's how it is. What goes into my book, as of noon, is that I apprehended you... for driving too fast, and advised you to proceed no further than the next rest area... your stated destination, right? Where you plan to take a long nap. Do I make myself clear?
Bullshit! You're just as much a part of it as they are!
Come on, baby don't try to tell us you never heard of the Grange Gorman.
Stop!
IS IT CLEAR?!
Well, it don't look pretty.
I have a CB in my truck, we could get some help out here.
Wha?
That's the oldest of the bunch, looked like the Grandpapa. We caught the little one, Junior, in the cooler there. As we've seen, what he lacks in size he more than makes up for in speed.
So, your husband ditched you?
HEY! No, I'm not trusting him either, that's why you and I will both be going with him.
You all sure about this?
Any more ideas Animal Planet?
We're better off.
Come on!
Your parents of relation?
All right!  Tell us about the truck!
Yeah, the lot's right there. My truck is right out back.
How are you holding up?
Wait, before you do that, help me to the kitchen, I need to lay down. There's a cot back there.
It's much safer in there, sweety.
How much you got?
My husband...
He's dead.
Go for it. It's by the far wall. A small wave band. Channel 9 is the emergency frequency. But I don't see the point.
What?
Nine?
They were all over the place.
Look, the armed surround the unarmed in a circle and we move as a tight group. Those that can shoot, protect the rest to his ride.
Shit!
I'm in a wheelchair, the truck sounds pretty good.
DON'T!
Go! Go!
Get to your cars!
Oh sweetheart! What was I thinking? Mommy is never gonna let you go. Oh Jesus... Never, ever, never let you go.
Shut up! Shut your mouth. You have no idea what is running through me right now. No idea.  I'm ready.
I know. Thanks. Just don't tell anyone I have a soft side.
Did we make it?
What did we say about lying?
Look, Frances, I didn't want this job. Think I'm crazy? But you begged me: improve your image. So please... lemme try, huh?
Come on, Frances. Louella Parsons is here. She wants to talk to you, help you out.
Excuse me, sir?
No, I'm concerned with everything.
You know what I mean.
That's not all, Frances. Mr. Bebe is very concerned about your politics. He hears you've been donating money, speaking at rallies.
Good, good. Give them that.
Okay, but come here first.
What's up?
Who?
Get your clothes on, lady --
No. It's all about that night, isn't it?
Look at her! She'll never pass that sanity test tomorrow...
We're all square now, Harry. Right?
You... I'm sorry, forgive me. Doctor, tell me honestly, what do I have to do to get out of here?
No, no, no. All he wants to do is see the common man get a little representation.
I love you, Mama.  I love you, Dad.
...So what do you think?
I know that, Dad, but --
Dad, here! You don't have to stop, just slow down. You can tell Mama I jumped out. She knows that's the kind of thing I'd do. She won't blame you.
Are you... are you hungry?
You're poisoning that child's mind.
Hell yes!... well, okay, I'm still in school. But as soon as I graduate... California, here I come!
Aren't you ever going back?
Oh yeah! I saw you in the newsreel!
Well... don't you think it's up to me to...
Not bad. But come on, Harry; what's the real reason?
Jesus.
But... but why, Harry...? Why'd they do it?
I know what ability you're interested in.
Harry... I met someone.
Is that why you did it?
You're telling me.
What're you gonna do, waste your talent? Why not use it to make something worthwhile. You can do that, you know?
I called your god-damned office! I want you to kill him, Harry. You'll do that for me, won't you? I loved him, I loved him... that bastard.
Nice joint. Can you afford it?
What for?
Six months' probation...? You gotta learn when to do battle, Farmer. You're not going to win many bouts with 200 pound cops.
I just wanted to be part of something... one thing, one play or one movie, something that was really fine... memorable. And I could say: I did that, I made something good.
I don't think I'd be much good in a war...
Why are you always leaving me, Harry?
Where to?
C'mere. I want to talk to you.
Oh, you...  ...ennh.
Very slow.  But we're not going to stop, are we?
Pretty morning.
Answer the question! Have you driven a car since you were placed on probation?
I live here.
But I want to. I'm trying!
Then show me! That's what I'm here for, to learn, to grow!
Mama...
I'll pay your way to New York. I'll work, I'll slave. I'll sell my vegetables to the truck farmers, or --
Well, they needed immediate answers, Frances. It's good manners and good sense. You shouldn't be bothering yourself with these right now.
What?
At one. Promise?
You know, the surest way to lose an appetite, is to drink, little sister.
I'm back, Mama.
No!
Where are you going?
You're not going anywhere!
You were hoping for a kind word?! You're my mother! You're supposed to nourish me! Support me!
No, my dear. You must be mistaken.
I find these initial meetings to be much easier without the concerned relatives in attendance.
Oh! Are you really?
You may discuss my predicament, Doctor. You may discuss it with anyone you like, but not with me. I'm not interested. I can solve my problems without recourse to a veternarian.
Normal. Average.
I never said... Oh look. That's just a figure of speech. She said something funny, and I said...
You what?
I'm sure you'll see it my way in the end.
I checked the files. This one holds the record for shock treatments. Four hundred seventeen and no end in sight.
It can't be as bad as that.
I have been... afraid. Afraid... they will hate me... because I am so very ugly... and they are so very beautiful
In which part of me did this knowledge reside? In these hands? In this mind? In this heart?  And reading and speaking. Not things learned... so much as things remembered.
What can I do?
Elizabeth, really! He's quite mad!
Nothing. Still nothing.
Something's wrong. I know it.  I've heard rumors of cholera spreading south from Hamburg.
I should go. I should leave today.
He always was opinionated.
Claude rode over there to see if held lost track of time. They say he never arrived.
God took her from us.
You will.  What do you want, Victor?
This feels... incestuous.
I wish to be your wife.
Our decision. Together.
What of our marriage? Victor, we've had so much tragedy. I want this family to live again.
Brother and sister no more.
I remember the first time I ever saw you. Crossing the floor of the grand ballroom with my parents at your side. So beautiful even then.
Are you having me on?
Quite a few.
The entire school heard it. It wasn't something one could miss.
You can't. Death is God's will!
Mine and Professor Krempe's.  We've been trading off nursing you in shifts. The rest of the time we're out working with the cholera victims. It's his turn for that just now.
Are you sure you'll be all right?
To say the least. I came here to expand my mind, but honest inquiry seems strangled at every turn. All we do is cling to the old knowledge instead of seeking the new.
It is a thrilling direction to explore. Thrilling and dangerous.  Nature can be wonderful and terrible. Science is not a realm for the reckless; it needs a conscience. We must proceed cautiously. Assess as we go.  What I do on my own time is my own business. The same holds true for you. You wish to expand your mind? Fine, do so. You can even join me here, if you like. But not at the expense of your normal studies.
"...a sincere and heartfelt apology which you will then read aloud to him before the assembled student body and faculty.
You're awake. I've prepared some broth. It'll help restore you.
Ah. An explorer.
The killer is still out there.
Shows how much you know. It's something about tomorrow.
Melvin Belli.
Next Friday.
Steve said for you to start on the boats.
Steve said you were thinking of leaving. True?
It still hurts?
Trouble?
Where?
How come?
You know what I said, though.
Somebody's there, Barry.
This is almost like the one at my uncle's cabin in Maine.
You saved my life.
Thanks.
What is it?
You ever fire one of those bows again, and I'll tack you up on the wall to dry.
Ha!
What about Neddy?
Don't call him.
Looks like a storm.
Like waves. It's never been likes waves before.
It's beautiful...
Last line of Gone With the Wind?
Yeah. I got it on before this --  -- all started.
What is your purpose in Mexico?
I don't know, one place's as good as another.
You like the car?
We got about two more hours of day light left. That'll get us into El Paso, which is right next to the border. We'll stop at a motel --
What are you gonna do?
If they get over the border, they're gonna let us go.
Son, I have this situation under control. I know exactly what I'm doing. You're going to have to trust me on this.
Now, you listen to me. You ain't gonna do a goddamn fucking thing, you hear me! Nobody cares what you think, I'm running this show, I make the decisions.
Not a chance.
Yes.
Jacob Fuller. Jacob, that's biblical, ain't it? What am I askin' for, of course it is.  What are their names?
Who's this?
Where is the little lady?
Died instantly?
Didn't think so. So, as I was saying, I'm willing to make a deal. You behave, get us into Mexico, and don't try to escape. I'll keep my brother off your daughter and let you all loose in the morning.
What did you call me?
Did he...?
Well, I say lets tear this place apart for weapons. So when they burst through that door, we'll make 'em wish they never did.
I promise.
It's the bitterest of pills.
I just bet you would. Don't even think about it. Besides, I want to have one night's sleep in an honest- to-goodness bed. The beds in the home are okay, but they're not like a real bed.
You're gonna be okay, aren't you, daddy?
I promise.
Not good enough, swear to God.
Richie, will you do me a favor and eat my pussy?
What?
What?
Do what?
Yeah.
Are you okay?
I'm sorry.
We've received no news one way or the other. We can only hope for the best.
They'll probably make a run for the border, which would bring 'em this way. And if we get our hands on those shit asses, we're talking payback time. We'll get 'em all right. I gotta piss. I'm gonna use your commode.
He comes in here every day and we bullshit. He's used my toilet a thousand times. If I told him no, he'd know something was up.
I never said help us!
What the fuck is wrong with you --
Start the car.
What did I tell you? What did I tell you? Buy the road map and leave.
Where's the woman?
I just want to go on record as saying this is a bad idea.
They're gonna search the van.
What does that mean?
You okay?
Well, let me tell ya something, gonna clear your head right up. We are officially Mexicans.
What dya mean, don't worry about it. Of course I'm gonna worry about it, I can't fuckin' see.
How?
What do you mean?
I don't know if there's any single reason.  But my father was Navy. And he had this old-time recruiting poster in his den.  It showed a girl trying on a sailor's uniform while saying, "Gee, I wish I were a man! I'd join the Navy!"  Was maybe 10 years old when I first saw it, and even then it felt wrong.  Made me mad.  And I don't think a month has gone by that I haven't thought about that poster.  "Gee, I wish I were a man."
Awright.  How's our girl doin', anyway?
So.  We're still coming to terms with the exact protocol for this -- for integrating the Spec-Recon training.  It may not always be smooth, but we're trying to make it as painless as possible for you.
Barber was my next stop, sir. Would've had it regulation sooner, only --
Pardon the hour, sir.  But you told me to come to you immediately if I felt I was being mistreated in any way.
I don't know of any delicate way to say this, lieutenant, so I won't try.  Claims have been made that you have engaged in fraternization -- of the same-sex variety.  Specifically, that you were...  "... seen leaving the apartment of another female officer at such a time and in such a manner as to suggest conduct unbecoming."
Fine by me, sir!
What, we're gonna pry 'em out with paddles?
Yes?
She made it through S.E.R.E. training.  Got a call this morning from --
The commission concluded that the aviator in question failed to execute a proper approach to the carrier.
Uh, ma'am.
Jordan.  I always hoped we'd get together -- though just now I'm gearing up for a child-care vote that --
You know him.
Wickwire was there to help.  To be my eyes on the inside, to make sure you were getting a fair shot.  At least that was the intent.
You don't know that.
Six o'clock!  Marking, marking!
Don't have to use it, O'Neil, but it's gotta go out.  Five... four... three...
Just do it, okay?
Boat Five -- Wickwire, Cozad, Vinyl, Intagliata, Ayers, and Wise. Lieutenant Wickwire is your senior officer.  Follow his orders to your death.
I've had it.  Just because they pay me like a baby-sitter doesn't mean I'm gonna be one.
She's an officer.  There's a higher standard.
Of course it is.  And I'm gonna stay on her until everyone realizes this is not some bullshit equal-rights thing, that real lives are gonna be lost.  Maybe mine, maybe yours.
I'll try anyway, sir.
The Navy Cross...
Just a coincidence?
Unless you Whiskey Run.
You expect the extraction team to ride the sub bare-back?  Is that correct, O'Neil?
So why're you even considering it? Are you?
She's haze grey and underway...
I'll try to keep the door open.  If you wash out, I make it so that --
So why are you telling me this?
You know, Royce, I got enough heat on me without you turning up the jets, too.
Someone screwed you over like this, left unanswered charges hanging over your head, and you're not gonna fight back?
Or like maybe he was baby sitting a problem child for the Navy.
"Wickwire, Thomas Dane"... Second run at Coronado... and correct, they had him stashed in the "Appropriation Liaison Office," whatever that is.
I'd sure like to know who.
O'Neil?
Last time I didn't.
Do you, uh, know...
She part of the training?
Are you hungry?  What's your favorite food?  We'll try to get it for you.
I'm not the one who got five good men thrown in a bamboo cage.  You wear the bars, you made the call, and you got your whole crew --
Didn't you know you'd be raped if you were captured?  Didn't you even think about that?
Thought you two were file-closed.
Congress cuts, military bleeds.  But Pentagon's a big place.  Let's narrow the sights.
I take it this file is still open.
Where's Audrey?
Me!? You where the one...
That why you dumped him?
He stole my report! That's my report!
Yeah. Why are you asking?
Animal, I can't.
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
So, you still picking apart cockroaches?
I still can't believe it. How does a guy go from an anti-nuke activists to working for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission?
What are you doing here?
Who was that French guy, anyway.
Did Romeo have a name?
Wish me luck!
We've secured the doors on both levels.
When we learned he could burrow his way through the tunnels we realized he could be out of the quarantined zone.
You didn't answer my question. In fact, for the last 18 hours no one has answered any of my questions.
Do you know that you just interrupted a three year study of the Chernobyl earthworm?
The radioactive contamination in that area altered the earthworm's DNA! You have any idea what that means?
Organize a search party. I want a complete sweep of the entire city and subway system.
I need you to trust me.
So why all the secrecy? Why aren't you guys working with the US military?
Here. 23rd street subway station. Where we first found the fish. With a little luck, this will lead us right to it.
I understand.
Not so bad. We'll get you to medical quarters. You're going to be fine.
Come on, old friend...
"The show must go on."
NO!  WE'RE ALMOST THROUGH!
About this much.
What?  What?
ALEXANDER??? PLEASE? You're my advisor, advise me!
Sense memory. I see you got to win the fight...
He's a twit!
Settle down, Alex...
And note the sucked in gut.
Oh my god, It's real.
... But I want you to know that I am not a complete braincase, okay? I understand completely that It's just a TV show. There is no ship, there is no Beryllium Sphere, no diagital conveyor... I mean, obviously it's all just a-
Commander, do you have a camera?  I'd die to see this in person... All they showed on T,V was a machine here, and a wall here... I don't know why they didn't show the whole thing.
How did you come to that conclusion?
Commander, you and Lt. Madison will have to go through the crushers one at a time in three second intervals. Tell me when the first crusher hits the bottom...
That's It?
A hologram...
...The digital conveyor.
THAT'S why you built this ship?
Oh, they're so cute.
...Okay
More to the left... Stay parallel...
We're alive!
A few fans built a little set in their garage.  .  I come in for an hour at most. It's a nothing.
Well you have to tell them.  What if something happens? We're actors, not astronauts... We can't do this stuff!
Hey... Hey where are you going?
We're leaving, Jason. We're leaving NOW.
I made the CUT THE LINE gesture. You nodded okay.'
You're playing your good side.
What IS that thing? It serves no useful purpose to have a bunch of CHOPPY CRUSHY things in the middle of a CATWALK!?.'
We got the Sphere but the Commander's down there with a bunch of cannibals!  Teb, reset the pod, we're going back.
I heard it too.
Tommy, look!  Those lights...
First, I require the Omega 13... Second-
Is it a bomb?  A booby trap?  Tell me!
Wait. What did you say?
We pretend...
We.. We lie.
Accelerate to Mark 4, Tommy.
Commander, I must speak to you. It is a matter of supreme importance... We are Thermians from the Klatu Nebula, and we require your help. I beseech you to come with us, back to our ship. A great many lives hang in the balance...
I... certainly, but-
You... You mean Earth?
How can we thank you, Commander. You- You have saved our people.
A thousand apologies. We have failed you.
I'm not a Commander, there is no National Space Exploration Administration. There is no snip.
The ship is a model... As big as this!... A very clever deception indeed! He oan't oontaln hIs lauchter.  A belle-----TOMMY Set a course for home, lommander?
Anything.
Go for the eyes. Like in episode 22 with-
NO NO NO.
I'm accused of using some government wagons to ship personal property.
Over three hundred miles.
What do you think, George, shall I resign?  It's what they want.
They're ready.  Believe me, the ones that stayed on here at Valley Forge are ready for anything.  Of course, we get nothing from Congress.  They need boots, coats... we desperately need food.
There's this whispering campaign against me ever since Gates won at Saratoga.
They love Reed and his inquisition! I think they hope to share in his disgusting profits!  It's becoming the American way!
You, you just need a new flint, General.
Misunderstood what!?
We've got powder but no ball!
That young school teacher... I heard the British hung him as a spy.
I was a clerk's apprentice on Saint Croix.  But, then I went to King's College.
It's impossible to stop these men deserting in winter, you might as well stop geese from migrating.
What is this?
What's your advice, Alexander?
George, you're the only man the people trust... trust with power. They know you won't betray them.
Colonel Charles Lee... Hounds and all.  Quite the character.  He's got a tremendous reputation.
If he supports the British why is it that every time he gets near them he kills so many of them?  Unlike General Lee... who you and Congress backed for second in command and who is a goddamned incompetent!
George, I'm sorry.  We all know the army will acquit Arnold...
They are... friends of Congress.
Makes you gag.
You think that?
No one wants another failure right now, God knows.  But people like Arnold and, God knows, I'm having my fears about General Washington.
Congress is bitterly opposed to allowing Negroes in the army!
Any word from Canada?
George, I'm afraid if you go through with this madness I must tender my resignation as your aide. I see where we're headed, you're putting your trust in the likes of Hamilton and Arnold...
And, Hamilton?  Greene?
'Continentals', Congress' paper money.  It was worthless to start with, but as you see, counter feiters have made them even less than worthless.  Can you tell which one is fake?
And how rusty are these muskets?
Because, if the British got off their asses and came up here, now, we would be smashed.  And the revolution would be finished.  Tell King Louis, it's that bad.
I feel the same, sir.
Surely you knew this was coming.
Our beloved father, the King, also refuses to bend.
Of course, if it were that simple.  These people?  They're after something else...
I can not allow the fortune in slaves my first husband created and what our partnership has elevated, to be destroyed...
Did you know that Jefferson has proposed a law in Virginia aiming at an absolute separation of state from the church?
It's an anti-Christian dogma!  I cannot believe you are so calm about it!
To win this war I need an army.
Is that why you come in here tossing pennies to my starving men? It's damned condescending!
Well, we must keep in mind the Dower Laws.  One third of everything we have is mine and since our Negroes have been interbreeding, it would be legally impossible to distinguish them.
A horseshoer?
No.  We're all of us after something.  It's easy for me to fight for the common man.  My father could only dream that I would be... a general someday?  And what of my daughter or son?  I know what I'm after.  But now, with all this talk about compromise?  It means the rich will just be more wealthy and the common man has no hope.
Nathanael, I'm sending you to Virginia to head the southern army, to harass Cornwallis.  Marquis, you must go with him.
George, you know I only love you, but...
And what is this, then?  Been off to fight the French because you are a patriot?  Or is this you, gaining your long sought after rise in society by becoming victorious in war!?
Now that is a lie!  See how much you want to create a scandal in exchange for a glowing reputation and polite society laid at your feet!  When you break off your engagement to Martha Curtis, I'll divorce William!  Do you hear?  You get what you want from this world, then throw it all away on love!
Oh, but you must not mind my talking about you!  In fact, William says my main job here at Belvoir is to civilize you; to make an honest English gentleman out of you.
Africa?  That's so far?  How do they get here?
Cranes?  Who needs to walk like a crane?
I always though London was the place to be:  capital of the world, the most spectacular city on earth.
Do you?  When I saw those men yesterday in the field... and the women and children in those hovels? I'm not so sure if America is as far from England as I'd hoped.
What are you doing?
You are a slave owner!  You have been illegally surveying lands beyond the Ohio Valley!  That land belongs to the natives!
I say!
I guess still in the locker.
His foot. Jeez, poor Ronnie...
Whoa... This is the man used to jump offa high buildings?
And if we don't happen to find it under Palmer's mattress or inside Karen Flores' undie drawer? What then?
Hell, why not just shoot her? Why not shoot everybody. Fuckin' shoot me. Shoot the fuckin' president?
You keep hittin' him like that, he ain't gonna look like he broke in anymore, he gonna look like someone beat him up and then shot him.
He comes up here with our product. He suppose to come home with five hundred thousand dollars. He never shows up. Meanwhile, my sister's going crazy calling me all the time worried about him. Me, I just wanna know what happened to my focking money.
Now why would you do that? Put the money in a locker?
You know, you speak very good English, Mr. Escobar.
She's... young.
I need the money.
In just a second. Two...
You broke in my house and I have a witness to it.
Only this time, no John Wayne and Dean Martin shooting the bad guys in El Dorado.
Assuming I go along with this, when can I have the five hundred?
The airport.
Ray Barboni?
How'd you get in here?
I checked the bag at the airport, when I came.
Tough shit, bro. This ain't Miami. You want something, talk to me.
You live in Miami?
What're you doing in Los Angeles?
Your wife a Lakers fan?
That's the idea. I'll think about it.
Anyway, you want this guy, he's in L.A. We put him on a flight after he spanked one a my cocktail girls in the Keno room.
Hey, Chil? Since you're goin' out to L.A. anyway.
I'm looking at you.
I want you to.
That's it? That's your movie?
That's half a movie, with holes in it. Maybe forty minutes of screen time. You don't even have a girl, a female lead, and on top of that, there's no one to sympathize with, you don't have a good guy.
You mean, Leo?
I'm not the guy, Harry.
I'm out here looking for Leo. I just looked you up as a favor to your dear friend, Dick Allen.
Is that right, that's what you do for a living?
You pack a gun?
Ever shot anybody.
Murray Saffrin, guy who wrote it, did all my Grotesque pictures, had it in a drawer for twenty years. He shows it to me one day, tells me he's got a star interested, would I produce it.
Two time academy award nominee, Martin Weir.
That, or I'm thinking what if some tragic accident were to befall the widow Saffrin -
That's the difference between you and me, Harry. I say what I mean. I want something from someone, I ask 'em straight out. I want Martin Weir, I go get Martin Weir. I don't fuck around with his trainer's shrink.
So how 'bout it, Mr. Selznick, do I make my deal with Bo? Or you gonna finally help me out, have a word with your dry cleaner when you find him.
Harry, if I gave you Leo's money you'd have Ray Bones all over your ass and then you'd be in a whole new kinda trouble.
Maybe I oughta talk to this Ray Bones character myself. See if he wants to invest in my movie.
Yeah, he told me.
So you want to know.
I turn it on when I confront the guy.
The wife sues the airline.  This is a gutsy babe.
At that point, basically, that has to be it.
You've been losing.
It's all mine.
You take all my money, but you're borrowing part of it?
A couple days ago by, people from the airliner come to see his wife, tell her how sorry they are and all that their plane exploded and offer her a settlement, the amount based on what he would've earned operating the dry cleaner's the rest of his life. Leo had some kind of trouble with his kidneys, so they were giving him about ten years.
Ripped nylons work. Makes the shot more real.
Yeah... that was a good scene. I mean, for a horror movie.
I know I'm better than what I've been doing the last ten years, walking around in a tank top and fuck-me pumps, waiting till it's time to scream.
Harry told me Martin loves it, he flipped.
Well, I gotta have a talk with Leo, my runaway dry cleaner.
I think it's not horrible.
I was never much into it. All that bullshit having to do with respect. It's bad enough having to treat those guys like they're your heroes, having to smile when they make some stupid remark they think's real funny.
That was Martin. He wants to have lunch tomorrow. That is, if you can make it.
How'd you meet Martin anyway?
No. I don't mean that. I just meant in general.
Harry... My God...
Harry, what're you doing? You're supposed to be in the hospital.
You okay?
They're closing the Granview. You know, theater down on Biscayne?
Hey, Chili.  Get your coat, but don't piss the guy off, okay? It could get complicated and we'd have to call Momo to straighten it out. Then Momo gets pissed for wasting his time and we don't need that.
I hate to say I told you, but I did. I told you don't start nothing with him that time.
What're you talking about? You wanna be a movie star?
How you gonna do that? You don't know shit about making movies.
Yeah, but whose point of view?
So Mildred says to the cashier, 'I saw the new Streisand picture.'  'God, I just love it at the end when she brushed Robert Redford's hair off his forehead the way she did when they were together, and the way they gave each other this look that said they still loved each other, but knew they couldn't be together. That look was so... romantic.'
Hello, Doris.
I miss Murray, Harry.
I'm not sure how I feel about this, Doris.
When I came upstairs, you stayed to finish your drink. I told you to turn off the TV when you were through.  Come to think of it, I also told you you could sleep in the maid's room.
That Miami flight that went down, it was on the news every day for about a week. Harry must've been busy.
I have to run. But what I hope to see, they begin to have misgivings about wanting the money. It becomes their moral dilemma and they try to rationalize keeping it, but in the end they can't. Can they?
Yeah and I'm wondering, how did it go wrong? How did it all... slip away?
Lufkin. His... agent.
Passenger vessel "Chimera." I will spell: charlie hotel india mary echo romeo alpha. No registry information is available at this time. I have determined to the best of my ability that the vessel has been abandoned on the high seas at position one seven four west, five seven north at...  Two zero one four hours zulu time. Over.
North Island, have you got any additional information? Over.
Roger, North Island. Please advise pending further information. Over.
What's so great about Sweden?
Where's his boat, then? Where's his crew? He ain't gonna be out here by himself, that's for damn sure.
I need lag bolts, especially one inch standard. And sheet metal. Preferably steel, about a sixteenth of an inch. Aluminium, even tin'll do.
When they find out what it's carrying, they may not be so interested in what's legal.
The turbine blew.
You'd think on a ship this size there'd be something left to eat.
One more?
Maureen.
You think that's funny
Probably slipped her moorings, got tangled up in a current.
Ready?
Nobody just scuttles a passenger liner either.
If this thing turns out to be a ship everybody thought sank a long time ago, we just hit the jackpot.
I don't know what else you'd call it. He's breathing on his own, but his pupils are completely blown out. He's totally unresponsive to pain.  What happened up there?
Other than the obvious, there's nothing wrong with him that I can see, not on the outside.
What say, Epps? You up for some roasted albatross?
If you get it back in one piece.
I thought you said it was just a blade.
But how long?
Didn't happen yesterday, I'll tell you that. Torn parts rusted bad as the rest of the boat.
Or somebody stopped them.
Then we're rich. We're damn, filthy stinking rich.
Yeah, yeah. I'm on it.
That'd be my guess.
Dodge to Murphy.
The radio!
What's slow?
Could be a fishing boat.
What'd he look like?
Headache, nausea, lights?
Sudden flashes of light.
She was sailing up north, right?
Ever heard of the Mary Celeste?
Nobody knows. There've been a lot of theories, of course. But we'll never really know for sure.
Maybe they didn't want it back. Maybe the whole fat deal was insured.
What? What the hell're you talking about.
So, we find this guy and make a deal with him.
Guess that'd be me. Again.
Hey.
Are we smart enough to avoid that?
What happened.
Murphy to Epps.
What do you think?
Too deep to anchor out there.
Yeah, but we still gotta haul that big piece of shit all the way back to Sitka.
I heard that.
What now?
Pretty low all around.
Greek citizen. Merchant navy.  Obviously we aren't the first to come across this ship. They probably stumbled across it just like we did.
What happened?
Gettin' a little hot under the collar, I'd say.
He took the shotgun and a light.
Now hold up just a minute. Let's be reasonable here.
I thought you say Tuesday.
Maxine.
Hi.  Look, I'm kind of tired - I think I'll go to bed.
Well, Maxine thinks she can get you a sales job at Computer Station. Normally you have to have references and at least two years of experience, but she thinks she can convince them.
Pumpkin? What's wrong?
It's nothing -- it's just some hormonal thing... don't worry about it...
I-I'm not sure... yeah, maybe.
What are you trying to say?
I dunno... Would I have to take classes and stuff?
What the hell is wrong with you?!
What can you tell me, young man, about the various flavors of "frozen yogurt"?
That's not him... Jesus, stop freaking me out.
Forget it.
I just stopped in to say hi.
Yeah, right...
Why not?
Okay... I promise.
What?... Oh suck my fucking dick!
What? Why?
God, just think, we'll never see Dennis again.
Hi.
Hey, look, the satanists are leaving!
Maybe there's some weird secret satanic society that meets at the Quality Cafe and all of the other regular customers are in on it except for us.
Maybe they're slowly poisoning us or they're planning to brainwash us and --
I want to do him!
You know, the green cardigan guy.
You call.
You're better at it.
What does it stand for?
God, I think Josh is too mature for us.
Are you sure?
He doesn't even look that bummed out, really.
That was truly pathetic.
He should totally just kill himself... Hey, here's one  ...Oh wait...  you have to share it with a non smoking feminist and her two cats...
I've been thinking about when we look for our apartment how we have to try and convince people that we're like these totally rich yuppies...
There he is...
I'll bet he never jerks off...
Why are we going here? I hate this place.
I didn't get it either.
Give me all your money, bitch!
Anthony's II!
Nothing. Don't worry... I promise I'll get a job next week.
You hang out with me because nobody else can stand to be around you.
What was that all about? I thought everything must go!
I think one of us should fuck Josh...
I am not -- I just think it'd be funny to see what he'd do...
Look, we have to get these...
Don't you want nice stuff?
That guy's band is playing tonight... Alien Autopsy.
What? When did you see Josh?!
Twenty-seven fifty-three... do you see it?  That must be it...
You're the psycho! You haven't been able to deal with anything since high school ended!
So, whaddya think?
I dunno...
You're lucky then, you can't see the veins on that guy's biceps.
May I ask what you're doing?
Well, if it isn't Enid and Rebecca, the little Jewish girl and her Aryan friend.
Fine, and how are you?
Thanks for the tape - I'll have to pay you later, I'm broke.
Do you have any old Indian records?
Is this one any good?
Yeah, it took a while before I got a chance to play it, but when I heard that song it was like --
Wow!
Yeah, sure, I guess...
Really? Can I see it?
I mean it -- You leave everything to me -- I'm going to be your own personal dating service!
What about her? Would you go out with her?
But putting that aside for now, would you go out with her?
C'mon Seymour, I'm trying to collect data here! Don't you want me to find you your perfect dream girl?
Every guy has a type!
I don't think so...
I really don't think it's a good idea.
What are we, in slow motion here?! What are ya, hypnotized? Have some more kids, why don't you?... For Christ's sake, would you move!?
It's not hopeless...
Yeah, well, I can't relate to humanity either, but I don't think it's totally hopeless...
"Four-piece Cook's special deep fried with side n' slaw it's OUT RAY-GEOUS"!
Hey, I get good benefits, a good early retirement plan, nobody ever bothers me...
Hey, can I borrow this?
Arrrghhh! Ah Jeez... Christ...
What, like a girdle?
Aren't you going to get that?
Uh... hello?
Yeah, I'll bet! So, how's it going with what's-her-name? Dana?
So, what kind of stuff do you guys do together? Is she into old records and stuff?
I'm going to this stupid art show and I want you to be my date... There's something I have to show you...
Well, you know... what do I know about clothes... I've never been the most fashionable guy -- it's nice to have someone do all the work for me...
No, no... not exactly... she just doesn't understand how I would know somebody like you...
What are you doing here?
That's Dana's - I'm supposed to be saving it for our two-month anniversary. You better not --
You need a bigger place - this is like a little kid's room.
I'm just being realistic.
Yeah, sure. Of course.
You know what my number one fantasy used to be?
You know what we should do? Let's go get in your car right now and just take off! We could just drive away and find some new place and start a whole new life... fuck everybody!
Who cares? Let's just go... what's stopping us?
Yeah, well... me neither...
So what's the story with the two cheerleaders over here?
Let me tell ya somethin', Joe... Listen to me, Joe... you can't hit a home run without swinging the bat!
Well, here's where the fun never stops!
So Josh, if this guy freaks out, will you protect us?
Very good. Now, what can you tell us about it in regard to your artistic intent?
Uh... hi. Uh... Enid's stepmother told me I'd find her here?
Why did you say she might be hiding from me? Did she say anything to you about me?
Thank you, doctor.
-oh, sing a different song, Abdullah-  -there's nothing wrong with your men so stop telling me there is-
Starting now, we attack them.
You'll need your confidence, I promise you.
What?
I'm David Hawthorne, this is my hospital. And my advice to you is, "don't get sick in front of it."  That was meant to be charming, sorry. I seem to have lost the knack.
A man-eater attacks and you're such a buffoon you almost forget to mention it?
-then he feasted on him, starting with his feet-
That's a terrible idea-
Oh dear-  -you're geting that downtrodden look again-
Many thanks.  You're Patterson, yes?  Nigel Starling- I'll be assisting you at Tsavo- but surely Beaumont must have told you that.
I've lived in Africa a year and I don't know what you know. How long have you been here?
I don't suppose I could watch.
I hate to be a bother, John, but the cramp's getting worse.  The pain is actually quite unbearable now.
John? I know this isn't the time to ask, but-
Second death? Where?-
I don't really. But understand something- even though it may take me two or three days to sort this out-  -when I'm gone, you'll still have to build the bridge. And I don't want the men to have lost respect for you.
The best way to ensure the kill when you're using trackers is for one to shoot while the other uses the trackers to force the lion toward the shooter. Have you ever led trackers?
Samuel says you killed a lion.
...misfire... it jammed...
Meant to ask you- the railroad car trap. Your idea?  Excellent notion- I used the same device myself once.
I'll be bait alone?
I'll have to.
Why do the workers look unhappy?
What are they looking at?
Oh yes, I think so. 
You like him, don't you?
He has children?
Afraid of lions.
Why do you laugh?- you don't believe she taught me?
Did you ever see a lion that size?
Gentlemen, there's no sickness smell at all here, and little blood. When we leave, close the gate securely, don't open it til morning and keep your fires high. Any questions, ask them now.  You two will sleep beautifully in your tents.  And stay there.
Oh, yes, I got in a little late this morning, Janosz.
What do you want with my baby?
We'll do the happiness index next.  I'd like to bring Ray in on your case, if it's all right with you.
Occasionally
You're also a human being, Frank.
No, you didn't, Frank.
I'm sure you didn't come here just to talk about art.
I may be wrong, but I think you've got a little crush on this guy.
You know, if anyone else told me that, I'd have serious doubts.  But coming from you, I can't honestly say I'm surprised.
They didn't find anything?  In the bathtub ... the pink ooze ... nothing?  So, what do I do now?
I'm not here to date.  I can't leave Oscar in a strange place with someone I don't know.
Does that start exactly at midnight tomorrow, or could you hold off for a few days maybe?
Can I help you?
Who are you going to call?
I'll let you get back to it.  Nice meeting you.
So you see, everything is in order, is it not?
Keep that up, mister, and I'll find you in contempt.
These boys aren't playing around.
The witness is leading him.  Sustained.
This is my cousin Sherman.  Sherm, say hello to the Ghostbusters.  I promised him a ride in the car if he got you out.
So what are you saying?  That the world of the supernatural is your special province?
Egon!
I'd like to have a stool specimen
It's working.  The positive GeV's are climbing.
This one's interesting.  Berlin, 1939, a flower cart took off by itself and rolled approximately half a kilometer over level ground.  Three hundred eyewitnesses.
Hey, I didn't imagine it.  There must have been ten thousand gallons of it down there.
We've found it at every event site we've been to lately.
Late Renaissance, I think.  Caravaggio or Brunelleschi.
Oh, hello, perhaps you could help me.  I'm looking for an aerosol love potion I could spray on a certain Penthouse Pet that would make her unconditionally submit to an unusual personal request.
Nowhere -- fast.  Why don't you lock up and buy me a sub?
This is what you do with your spare time?
Like a goat on garbage.
I hope we have enough stuff to do the job.
Vigi, Vigi, Vigi -- you have been a bad little monkey.
What's your story, Pete?
Give it up, Ray.  You're living in the past. Ghostbusters doesn't exist anymore.  In a year these kids won't even remember who we are.
Are you all right?
She's moving!
Well, I guess some people have it and some don't.
You know you shouldn't leave your TV on so loud when you go out.  That creep down the hall phoned the manager.
Oh, sure.  I'm getting used to this.
That's too bad.
Uh-huh.
I think I should spend the night here.
You must have gotten the last copy.
I don't think so.  I'm busy Thursday night.
I don't know.  You've got two people in there already.  It could get a little crowded.  I want you to close your eyes and relax.  Now I'm going to speak to Dana and I want Dana to answer.
Right ... You're the Gatekeeper.  But I want Dana.  Dana, speak to me ...
Nothing!  We just got rid of that thing in your kitchen.
Yeah, along with most of your furniture and a lot of your personal possessions.  This one took some work.
I trust you're moving us to a better space somewhere on campus.
But why?  The students love us!
What's that got to do with it?
You're very handy, I can tell.  I bet you like to read a lot, too.
Great!  How's it going?
And how many ghosts have you caught, Mr. Venkman?
And would this storage facility be located on these premises?
And may I see this storage facility?
And what is the magic word, Mr. Venkman?
Mr. Mayor, it's a pretty simple choice. You can believe Mr. Pecker here ...
Circle?
Hey, Mister!  Can I see those guns?
Yes?
He wants to shut down the storage grid.
Who?
Look at the structure of the roof cap.  It looks exactly like the kind of telemetry tracker NASA uses to identify dead pulsars in other galaxies.
Spengler and I have charted every psychic occurrence in the Tri-State area for the past two years.  The graph we came up with definitely points to something big.
What is it?
"Get her?"  That was your whole plan?  You call that science?
Everybody can relax.  I found the car.  How do you like it?
They will.
I'm getting high readings near the air vents.  It must be using the duct system to get around.  See, I told you we'd get something.
Third floor.  Get down here,
It doesn't seem to have slowed him down any.
I couldn't help it!  It just popped in there!
Hey man.  What is it you're so involved with there?
Me, too. Parts of the Bible are great.
What's he talking about?  Choose what?
Where are we now, Commodus?  Can you see the camp?  My Gods!  The air is turning into ice!
Quite so.  Narcissus and his courageous men; may they live long to serve Rome...
I should at least have you, don't you think?
Being as close, I'm certain you've noticed what we all have noticed.
I'm ordering a general stand-down in preparation for withdrawal back across the Danube.
Forgive me, Caesar, but do two Senator represent the mood of the whole Senate or the will of the Roman people?  Besides, every truce we make with the Germans they break!
Give away food?
Marcus Aurelius has died.
We must obey our emperor and the Senate.
Where is my father?
Tribuus, what happened in the arena? Was Narcissus killed?
So tell me, what happened between you and the emperor?  What really happened on the German front?  You know the Senate's arguing your case...
My birth sign is Water Bearer, twenty-fifth day in the month of Janus.
It's time for you to tell the Citizens that Commodus stole the money allocated for defending the German border.  It's time to tell the citizens everything.  Will you write it?
The battle was won, today, and I prefer to believe it was a gift of Janus, the eldest God of Rome.  God of my ancestors.
The Senate too?
Who are you?  Narcissus The Good?  I have heard of Narcissus Meridas. That's who I hear you are.
I thought all good generals were quick to recognize opportunities.
Why do you keep playing at being so humble?  It's a little embarrassing.
You cannot die.
Commodus, it's we who are going on the offensive.
I want you to start your work for the last phase of the campaign.
If I'd ever had a sign that you wanted to rule I would have... no, again, it's my own bullheadedness. Narcissus, I should have adopted you years ago.  And now the Gods are begging me to make you my son!
I made the plume from a quail feather.
What are you fighting for in here? The good of Rome?  I can end this madness now!  Take the job for the sake of the Gods, live!
I'll never die.  You tell the girls that.  You honor our ancestors and I'll be there.  Every night.  At the table of life.
Who the hell are you?
Thank you.  What is going to happen tomorrow?  Exactly?
At the end of the day I was approached by the Golden Pompeii Olive Oil company.  Small, but profitable.  They asked if you would endorse their oil.  We could get some very nice posters.  Make some very big money...
No more bad luck now!  The people are anticipating you!  I have posters up over half the city advertising you as the great warrior -- the true Roman!  The man who fought side by side with the wolf of Rome!
You get to come alive again in the country!
But -- you have to go out there! I'll give you more than your one third!  When I get paid... just take the fall!  You're too hurt to fight and the man's a killer!
Such nobility from such an ignoble mouth.  Take my advice and make that bet.
How much money is involved?
I want another interview with Cos. Tell him to bring plenty of ink.
So, things change.  The government has moved to the circus.  You're going to fight last.  And Commodus is going to fight first.
Let's talk about this later.  Right now we have other things to settle. You and your family will be leaving with a supply ship returning in the morning to Ostia.  From there, Caesar has decreed you be given an estate in Paestum.  It's beautiful; an old Greek town right on the ocean.  Rich soil.  Perhaps we could keep our financial arrangements... although Caesar will give you a sort of pension it's always good to look to the future, keep your hand in the arena... so to speak.
You're living at home now. Is that right?
Why not?
Where is the car?
I want to go home.
Listen -- could you stop crying, please?
I'm sorry. That is not my business.
Did they ever find out?
You mean the one who --
Where are you meeting this person?
Benjamin -- you're -- I don't know what to say -- you're --
-- really incredible --
What?
No. I want to know why you're here in Berkeley?
Well, I want you to leave.
-- how you -- how anyone -- could do a thing like that.
Then you took her upstairs and you raped her.
Please let me go.
Benjamin, when you came up here, what did you think was going to happen between us?
I don't want you to go anywhere until you have a definite plan.
You won't?
How about tomorrow? I don't mean to be pushy but --
Well -- look -- don't be confused. We're getting married.
Elaine -- are you serious about this?
Why wouldn't it?
Carl who?
657-2036
This is Dr. Smith's answering service.
I like to know who's living in my house. I like to know what my boys are up to.
Oh -- hello, Mr. McCleery.
Look -- I'll give you ten dollars for a dime -- I'll give you twenty -- for God's sake, will you let me use that phone?
I'm putting it on the top step.
Hello.
Where are you?
What?
Oh -- yes. The Singleman party.
Yes sir?
Where is your luggage?
I'll have a porter show you the room.
Is it a girl?
What do you drink? Bourbon?
All right then.
No.
For God's sake, Mrs. Robinson, here we are, you've got me into your house. You give me a drink. You put on music, now you start opening up your personal life to me and tell me your husband won't be home for hours.
Mrs. Robinson, will you forgive me for what I just said?
Her portrait?
I don't remember her as having brown eyes.
Yes?
I think I'll go to bed.
Thank you.
Then why do you keep running away?
But they would! Don't you see?
I really don't want to put this on again. Won't you bring it up?
I want to say something first.
Do you understand what I said?
He didn't see me.
Do you want to?
But there's one thing. The desk clerk seemed to be a little bit suspicious. I mean -- I don't know what their policy is -- but --
Yes -- I think that would be good.
Yes?
To tell you?
Well -- I want you to know how much I appreciate this -- really --
Well.
Sure. Shall I -- I mean shall I just stand here? I mean -- I don't know what you want me to do.
Thank you.
Would this be easier for you in the dark?
Are you afraid of me?
Oh my God.
Yes I do. I know quite a bit about it.
Are you interested more in modern art or more in classical art.
You're not interested in art?
I got up. I ate breakfast and went shopping. During the afternoon I read a novel.
So you don't love him. You wouldn't say you --
Oh no. You had to marry him because you got pregnant?
And you were a student also.
Because I'm interested, Mrs. Robinson. Now what was your major subject at college?
Oh no. In the car you did it?
What kind of car was it?
Do you understand that?
I'm good enough for you but I'm too slimy to associate with your daughter. That's it, isn't it? ISN'T IT?
You go to hell. You go straight to hell, Mrs. Robinson. Do you think I'm proud of myself? Do you think I'm proud of this?
What are you doing?
Yes. Please. I want you to.
Now it seems to me --
What have you done to her?
Ahh. I don't think you'll have time for that drink after all.
No -- actually I'm not --
Braddock -- Braddock?
Say hello to Mrs. Robinson, Benjamin.
You don't have to tell me if you don't want.
Oh. Well, I don't. Shall I tell you what I do?
But I want you to. Please. Please will you believe me.
Don't go on like this. Now if Benjamin absolutely refuses to take her out --
I'm going up to Berkeley today.
They don't know?
Well -- when did you decide all this?
Would you mind telling me then -- what were those four years of college for? What was the point of all that hard work?
Sir?
I know.
You have yourself a few flings this summer. I bet you're quite a ladies' man.
Ben -- I want you to give her a call.
Hi, Ben. What are you doing with yourself these days?
That's what I'd do if I could. Nothing wrong with that. Hey Ben, Elaine's coming down from Berkeley soon. I want you to call her up this time.
No, I don't.
Listen to me. We got -- we got into bed with each other. But it was nothing. It was nothing at all. We might -- we might just as well have been shaking hands.
Can you see me now?
I don't believe it.
I'm having luck for the first time in my life.
It's a short life and a gay one...
Time's getting short.
I want to speak --
Need any help?
How?
No -- no -- no -- no...
I've quit.
I have an idea working in my head... 
Too bad.
Shall we say five o'clock -- downstairs?
Chasing around.
I'll do anything for you.
Going?
So you feel like coming into a lady's room -- and you come... What now?
Why do you look at me like that?
And -- and --
Alone. All alone.  Oh, you strange -- strange creature.
I want to be alone.
I see -- you do only what you take pleasure in doing. You take pleasure in coming into a woman's bedroom and you come. You take pleasure in a dangerous climb onto a balcony, so you do it... And what is your pleasure now?
The veronal -- you. I'm going to stay here with you.
No?
That's a silly joke.
Grusinskaya --
I want to be good to you -- madly good.
You must go now. Be careful on your way to your room.
Thank you, sir.
Then you know him?
Baron, we must have gone a hundred miles an hour, at least...
Perhaps this evening, Baron, we could go to the Casino -- the place we passed with the marvelous bright lights?
If we could scare up some men to play.
That was my last.
Drink to me, Kringelein -- it's my last chance.
Good evening -- my key -- one sixty- eight.
Well -- last night was not so good.
Pardon me, the lady has urgent business here with me.
I think it would be much better if you went away.
Aha! -- The Baron. What do you want here?
So that's how we stand, Baron.
For me?
And the child isn't coming?
It seems that he was a thief and an imposter.
Oh!
There is no pocketbook here... On the floor probably. 
You may laugh. Caviar and champagne may mean nothing to you, but to me -- they mean a great deal. You see, I'm ill and all of a sudden I got a fear of missing life. I don't want to miss life -- do you understand?
You like music?
Dance then? 
You must look at my face and not at the floor.
You dance splendidly.
Then why did you have anything to do with him?
When I -- I'm ill, Flaemmchen -- It will not be long -- I'll not last long. Will you stay with me until...
What...! --
Moreover --
Do you work in Justice Zinnowitz' office?
Tired?
What is this?
You...
What?
Cotton Company --
How nice -- your daughters?
Oh -- too bad. Did you quarrel? 
Now, children, no fighting -- save that for the office. Let's have our dance. 
Oh, yes, Mr. Preysing?
Yes.
You see, I'd like to take a secretary with me for my correspondence and -- humm -- humm -- for company on the trip -- I'm nervous -- I need somebody -- I don't know if you quite understand me. You said you have travelled with gentlemen -- and I mean --
Baron!
What we want to know about is Manchester.
What?
I mean with the Manchester people?
No water -- What a place!
I know you did -- I said you did --
Madam will dress now, it is late.
Oh! Madam is cancelling the engagement. Madam has chosen a funny time for such a funny joke. Ha, ha, ha -- hurry, come on. Tonight -- there's a line in front of the theatre since six o'clock. The house is jammed to the roof.
Take them back, Suzette.
It is time for the performance.
Gru -- you are positively radiant.
Certainly, sir.
What is this insolence?
My best friend -- poor, Baron -- dead -- just like that.
Yes, the police must be called.
Yes, I know them --
Just one moment, sir.
We will wait.
If the house is empty again, I don't know --
Ach! Here you are, Doctor Zinnowitz.
I can make no statement about Manchester at this time.
What's the matter with you?
She had an engagement in the Yellow Room at five o'clock -- she was in a hurry.
Pretty as a picture.
How'd you figure you were gonna get away with that?
Now I'll ask you another. You think I got no contacts out here? That nag paid off at just the opening price. There wasn't hardly a flutter on the tote board from the time the odds were posted. There ain't enough action to tickle the tote, but you claim a ten grand win! You send me ten thousand dollars, like I'm some mark you can blow off!
Permanent damage.
Almost forgot. That ten grand of yours. It's in the envelope by the door.
You want a drink?
He's a good kid. A salesman.
Yeah? You really think so? A lot of people been telling me the same thing.
Worries about his mother, eh? Give him a hug for me.
Come on, kid, let's see if there's any food in the house.
Right in front of the room.
Cole, it'll be all right. Honey?
His blood pressure is under a hundred. I don't think he'll live to get to the hospital.
Yes, yes, but that's --
Bobo wants you to go on to Delmar.
Nine hundred. Bobo needs somebody to handle playback this time. Come on, Lilly, you don't argue with Bobo.
Mrs. Langtry, I'm sorry.
You are a valued customer, as you know.
Whadaya say?
Makes no difference to me if they're only on commission. If they don't make good money, they're not giving us good representation, and we can't afford to have them around. Ever supervise salesmen?
I can't take that job! I mean, I mean, I can't take it right away. I'm still recuperating, I just dropped in to say hello, see everybody --
But you need a man right now. It wouldn't be fair to you to --
You're turning me down? Makes no sense, Roy.
Oh, come on, Roy.
That's what we'll do, then. But I tell you what, Roy. Before I hire anybody else, I'll ask you one last time. Fair enough?
What happened to your hand?
I like those.
Why?
You're dead, Lilly, it worked.
I sat in there with her, I thought, what do I do now? Run and I've got Bobo and the law after me. Stay, and how do I explain?
What do you want me to do? Pin a halo on you? You're doing a pretty good job of that yourself.
Roy... What if I told you I wasn't really your mother? That we weren't related?
Let me see how you did that one.
Look at me.
Who else is paying for all this? You badmouth the woman all the time, but you sure do take the payoffs she gives you.
I don't like to come here, Roy. Every time I do, your mother comes in and makes remarks.
And you never defend me. You're afraid of her.
I don't see why we have to take the train.
Big spender.
The tap. What you do for a living.
You talk the lingo. What's your pitch?
He'd explain he had to have cash, so there wouldn't be any paper trail for the SEC. And a lot of cash, or it wasn't worth while. The least we ever took was forty thousand, and the most was one hundred eighty-five thousand dollars! From one sucker!
No no! He never calls the cops, not after we give him the blow-off.
He retired.
Upstate.
Take a hike, you mean?
I still don't see why we have to have separate rooms. You expect your father to come through?
Running your broker scam, you mean.
You mean, it would be too tough to give me a turndown here. Easier on home grounds.
Wait a minute! When did this happen, that we're partners?
I grant you, it's a little odd, shoot yourself with a gun with a silencer on it, but it was hers, all right. It really is your mother, Mister Dillon.
What?
Oh, Jesus.
Well, when you put it that way.
One set of muddy shoe prints.
As which point she drops to her knees in pain...
Impressive, Blake.  Where'd you learn how to do that?
That's it?
Yes.
Mind if we sit down?
Might want to stop and think about the safety of your students, Miss Tate.
My god...
Do you know who did this?
Another historical inaccuracy.
No.  Wait for the police.
Don't think so.  But they sure did a real number on your office. Crap everywhere.
The dorms are only fifty feet away.  You could practically see into my window.  So, what difference does it make?
Alright, I was wrong.  There is a big difference between rooming with your buddies and living with your mother and school headmaster.
Where are you going?
You're twisted.
Shit, John!  What the hell were you doing out there?!
You some kind of fugitive or something?
Any other psychotic relatives I should know about?  Jason?  Freddy Krueger?
Why didn't you tell me?
Where's Molly?  She's not in her room...
Keri.... Laurie... how about if I just call you Mom?
Not me.
What are you doing here?!
Are you crazy?  You'll get caught.
You really think Eddie killed her?
Aren't they doing a terrific job this year?
I have to pee.
You aced it, didn't you?
Fuckin' A.
Shane's going as a condom.
I'll pop a Benadryl.
No!  I keep seeing him staring out his window. Watching me.
Seven-thirty is the costume pageant ... Carving jack-o'-lanterns at eight ... Photos for the school paper at nine ... Then Harry lights the tree at nine- thirty ... I just know I'm forgetting something!
Jesus, that's my neighbor.  Tommy.
Guess they -- went to the fair after all.
Mommy!!!
Shitheads ... Defacing my property.  I showed them ...
See what I'm talkin' about?
Where are you going?
Where's the baby?!
As always, your keen powers of perception astound me.  And you're right.  I've come to celebrate.  After thirty-two years as Psychiatric Administrator, guess who has been named Smith's Groves new Chief of Staff.
But with Rogers and his house of hacks gone, you'd make the rules.  Just think it over.
It was Jamie Lloyd.  She came back, as I knew she would one day.  And whatever has brought her back has brought Michael back as well.
There you are.  Who was that boy?
What's wrong?  What's happened to Jamie?
She has the gift -- the blood of Thorn running through her veins.  Michael's mother had it, too.  So for six years I incubated her, prepared her for this night.  Michael has served his purpose.  And soon we will have a new progeny.
What do you know about Michael?
Home, sweet home.
No.
You were rich before.  This is the first time I was ever rich.
You ever own a motorcycle?
And how were things?
I dunno, boy.
That's against the law, isn't it? I can't wear a uniform anymore.
All the more reason to go to Africa.
Go live in a safe-deposit box--with your things. LOOSELEAF Jesus--I wouldn't want to be married to him.  You know?
You never played a violin.
Anybody who'd drop an atom bomb on a city has to be pretty dumb.
Hello.
Is Penelope in?
Blue soup.
Would somebody please pass me the catsup?
Who's going to fly our helicopter now?
You invited me.
What went wrong?
I wouldn't drop my gun.
I'm smarter than Looseleaf.
You don't know where your mother is? Does she put on a short skirt and go drinking all night?
Aha!  He has a brilliant military record, I'm sure.
Oh hell.
Behind a desk for a little while.  A desk!  They had him planning air raids.  A city can't flee like a coward or fight like a man, and the choice between fleeing and fighting was at the core of the life of Harold Ryan.  There was only one thing he enjoyed more than watching someone make that choice, and that was making the choice himself.  Ask about Spain, where he was the youngest soldier in the Abraham Lincoln Brigade.  He was a famous sniper.  They called him "La Picadura"--"the sting."
The story gets hairier.  Should I stop?
You're supposed to get hurt!
Alive and hale.  He's throwing a little surprise party for his own family.  Is your mother often this unstable?  Penelope!
She said you were legendary.  I wrote a theme about you, and she said, "Your father is a legendary hero out of the Golden Age of Heroes."
Dad--
"Hamburger Heaven."
How do you do?
You feel that you're behaving as a woman should?
Bluh.
We all are.
I'm so glad you like each other.  I was so scared, so scared.
Awful.  I can't tell you how sorry I am.
We were one hell of a pair--and we'll be one again.  What we need is a honeymoon.  Let's start right now.
I have some change!
Breakfast?
That's what you're supposed to say.
That's too bad.  I would rather have him at home--to see what I'm going to do.
Two hundred years old.
Well--what have we here?  A family.
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye.
Money?  There's plenty of that. Mildred got the brewery.  You'll probably get the baseball team.
Testimonials of that sort are--are beyond my range.  I don't do them well.  That's a failing, I know.
You're begging him to kill you?
So he can kill you.  You hate your own life that much.  You beg for a hero to kill you.
I'm going to call the police.
Give me that Goddamn thing!  Now get out of here, or I might kill you.  Who knows?
Norbert--you come, too.  Let him go, Harold.  Let him go.
Can I--uh--help you gentlemen?
Safe and sound, I see.  Oh--you came back.
None.
Pacqualinincheewa root.  Means "cougar fang." Cures anything but a yellow streak down the back.
Good Lord.
It died for your sins.
What brought you back?
A living fossil!  Like the cockroaches and the horseshoe crabs.
I haven't told you, Harold, how comical I think you are.
Glands.  You're supposed to be happy when you die.  Call me comical again.
You hope.
Cut me open.  Find out.
I put a poisoned thought in your head.  Even now that poison is seeping into every lobe of your mind.  It's saying, "Obsolete, obsolete, obsolete," and, "Clown, clown, clown."
You have a very good mind, or I wouldn't have come back.  That mind is now asking itself, cleverly and fairly, "Is Harold Ryan really a clown?" And the answer is, "Yes."
Don Quixote.
I'm going to shoot you now.
Don't shoot.
No.  No.
No.
Jesus--I dunno.  You know.  What the heck.  Who knows?
You didn't even find that out?
Dead!
How horrible.
And you, Colonel?  Let me guess: You don't know.
So long, you guys.
That goes double for me.
That's an interesting piece of news.
Then who flushed the toilet?
What?
I don't get it.
What are his symptoms?
Peace, everybody--Paul, Penelope.
We don't have a maid any more.
Everything stays as it is!
It's fine!
I hate that thing.
It came yesterday.  I haven't opened it yet.
He'd kill me.  He'd be right to kill me, too--the kind of guy he is.
I'm touched.
Did you see him?
The park!
Then I saw this bakery store that was still open, so I bought a birthday cake.
A week.  We were waiting for the right time to--
It's true.
"War is not healthy for children and other living things." How lovely.
Oh no!  Wear a coat of cotton--wear a coat of wool.
After this explosion, I think, he'll be able to accept the fact that his mother is going to marry again.
Every night, Penelope, for the past two years, I've made it a point to walk through the park at midnight.
They didn't murder me.
He can make the sound of human footsteps--which is a terrifying sound.
I'm taking her to the airport a few minutes from now.  She's going to East St. Louis--to visit an aunt.
You fool, you fool.
Everything's going to be beautiful.
You've got to fight from time to time.
Or get eaten alive.
Phooey.
We simply stop doing that--dropping things on each other, eating each other alive.
Chinese maniacs and Russian maniacs and American maniacs and French maniacs and British maniacs have turned this lovely, moist, nourishing blue-green ball into a doomsday device.  Let a radar set and a computer mistake a hawk or a meteor for a missile, and that's the end of mankind.
Start with the smallest weights. Every week add a pound or two.
You ever hear the story about the boy who carried a calf around the barn every day?
Minors aren't allowed at fights.
We have this new club up here in Heaven.
No, just not the type.
Okay. I'll take a half hour.
You're still dressed?
Well, actually I wanted to ask about this girl. I have her picture here.
What do you mean?
That's cool.
Hello. You want some information?
My name is Hope. This is Faith.  Charity's in back.
Man, how many girls do you need?
Is this all the display space we can get?
Yeah. He's a nice guy. Don't lose him. Maybe we could tone down this stripe a bit. It's a little...
Are you sure it's all right?
Kristen went on that convention today, didn't she?
Do I know you? Weren't you on the set the other night? With Ramada.
You making a feature?
Joanne?
You don't drink?
Okay. Sucking off. Now does that make me as good as you?
Is that the way it was with you?
How important do you think sex is?
They were here?
What does that mean?  What does he do?
What the crap?
I is for Irresistible Grace. God's grace cannot be resisted or denied. And P is for the Perseverance of the Saints. Once you are in Grace you cannot fall from the number of the elect. And that's the 'TULIP.'
He has to. That's Predestination. If God is omniscient, if He knows everything -- and He wouldn't be God if He didn't -- then He must have known, even before the creation of the world, the names of those who would be saved.
Yeah.  Well, mostly.
I wouldn't expect too much. I mean about her coming back. Once a girl gets into the life.
Look, Niki, this really isn't my business. I don't know anything about...
Dogshit. Worse yet, they don't care.
I've got a meeting...
I've got some news. Your daughter's all right. At least I think she is.
They're legal now.
I'm only human, you know.
But this is my apartment.
What are you doing here?
Andy, can you do something for her? Maybe money...
Is Marsha there?
Wes, do me a favor.
Hey man.
I know. Word's out on the street -- word's also out you ain't really hiring anyone.
God, I don't know what it was called. I never saw it. I only got twenty- five bucks for the whole Goddamned thing.
Do you work for the San Francisco Police Department, or do you have any other affiliation with any law enforcement agency?
What you got in mind?
I don't know no Ratan, but I may be able to help you out. It's not me, of course. Just helping out a friend. It'll cost you five hundred bucks for a single screening.
Meet me here today at seven o'clock. With the money. Then we'll go see the film.
You wait here. I'll find out where she is.
Who the fuck knows? The Four Aces. He goes there.
This is from the movie I was talking about.
I wondered if you had ever seen this film or this woman...  ...right here.
Here. Take your fifty cents back.
Yes.  I'm interested in financing an adult feature film. I was told you were the man to come to.
Jake.
Look again, Billy-boy. This is jail bait. Could get you in a lotta trouble.
Eh, Poli Sci?
Yes.
Could I see your registration?
Your tree.
We planted it.
Well, I don't know. Do you know, Harold?
How interesting.
Sorry I'm late.
Here's your shovel.
Yes.
Not <u>any</u> car. I like to keep a variety. I'm always looking for the new experience, like this one. I liked it.
It's all memorabilia, but incidental and not integral, if you know what I mean.
A self-portrait.  But over here is my favorite. It's titled "Rainbow with Egg Underneath and an Elephant." Do you like it?
Now I'll pump it up...  ... and you just turn the handles.  Okay. What do you smell?
Here we are, Harold. Oat straw tea and ginger pie.
The universal language of mankind.  What music do you like, Harold?
What is it?
An ice sculpture. It's Venus - the Goddess of Love, the completion of which is his unfulfilled dream.
He's never finished one yet. He has around him every kind of hand tool known to man, but the poor dear has difficulty staying awake.
A little after-dinner liqueur, Harold?
Thank you.
What were you fighting for?
Oh, yes! Every day. But I don't need a defense anymore. I embrace! Still fighting for the Big Issues but now in my small, individual way. Shall we have a song?
There. Oh, I like the feel of soil, don't you? And the smell. It's the earth. "The earth is my body. My head is in the stars."  Who said that?
Oh, those motorcycles are awfully chilly.
I <u>think</u> I see it.
Well, I really don't smoke.
I'm sure picking up on vices.
Did Confucius say that?
Died! Seventeen times - not counting maiming.  Shot myself in the face once with a popgun and a pellet of blood.
No. I'd feel stupid.
It's sinking, Harold. Going over the horizon - where we are all going to go. It's getting dark. "Let each man hold on to his candle and get a light where'er he can."
Maude, I must speak to you.
You sure have a way with people.
Supper for two.
Farewell?
Oh, Harold! What a fuss this is.  So unnecessary.
But, Harold, we begin to die as soon as we are born. What is so strange about death? It's no surprise. It's part of life. It's change.
Chardin. Dame Marjorie. But you may call me Maude.
Please, don't you realize? She is dying.
Of course, Harold's father had a similar sense of the absurd. I remember once in Paris he stepped out for cigarettes and the next I hear he's arrested for floating nude down the Seine - experimenting in river currents with a pair of yellow rubber water wings. Well, that cost quite a little bit of "enfluence" and "d'argent" to hush up, I can tell you. Harold, dear, stop playing with your food. Don't you feel well?
Mother.
How do you do?
I don't think I'm getting through to Mother like I used to.
Yes. It does.
My mother spoke to my Uncle Victor. He's in the Army and he fixed it up.
Is it the machines? The noise? The people?
Your classmates?
We are not relating today, Harold. I sense a definite resistance. A lack of true and helpful communication. I find you a very interesting case, Harold, but this reluctance of yours is detrimental to the psycho-analytical process, and can only hinder the possibility of effective treatment. Do you understand?
I see. Tell me, Harold, do you remember your father at all?
Let's examine the facts on it. I say this country has been too harsh in its outright condemnation of war. I say you can point to many material advantages brought about by a crisis and conflict policy. Hell, World War II gave us the ballpoint pen. That's common knowledge.
How about to slit his throat?
Sir, how about souvenirs?
Good afternoon, Officer. Bit of trouble here?
Frank.
She's done it.
I want to go back!
Almost complete withdrawal. She hasn't said a word for nearly two years.
No bad dreams.
What do you mean?
Get out of the way.
I don't know, Kyle. You're the fucking expert. Now get out of the way!
No deals! Just information. Information. Free of charge. No strings. Just information.
What is this? Someone else you think escaped us, like Frank?
Easy, easy. Whatever happened, whatever you saw, it's not here now.
Look at them ugly suckers, Blue. One sheet of glass between them and us.
Don't get psychic with me.
Would'ya look at this babies? Made 'em myself. Holy water, silver shavings, white oak: the works.
That's all for you, Sammy.
You are a Catholic??
You're wasting our time: There's nothing on this island but sheep and rocks.
Do you believe in hell?
What the hell was that? An ape?
Every time the media get a look at him, they come to me. I'm running out of lies, Trevor.
These freaks, Trevor, they give me the creeps. And I'm not the only one. You're up for review. You and your petting zoo.
Son. About Rasputin --
Don't look! Turn around.
They took his name from this little inscription that was stuck on his tank.
Well, you did break out --
C'mon, champ. You look a little woozy, there.
Uh-oh -- John.  Staring at what?
-- should go back. Now!
You'd better stay here. I'll find a way out. We'll come back for you.
Yup.
Myers?
Hey, your chili's getting cold --
It's nothing. Just a list -- It's not finished --
Liz -- can I call you Liz? It's a beautiful name --
You fucking ass-holes.
It's my lucky day.
Got her mother's looks.
Oh.
It's a means to summon us -- it's called the Lament Configuration.
This isn't for real.
Many times.
We've got such sights to show you --
Please. Get back into bed.
Please listen to me --
Oh my God.
You bastard --
Frank --
What about Larry --
Julia.
Back from where?
My nerves... are beginning to work again.
Ssh. Don't want babe to hear.
A long time.
I was bored. I'd done everything. I'd gone to the limits. There was nothing left to experience. At least nothing I could buy on earth.
You would be. They tore me apart.
It gave me a little chance, and I took it. They won't get me back. I'm going to live, and you're going to help me. Yes?
You can't love him.
There's a towel in the bathroom.
It's ONE of these.
I thought half of it was your brother's?
What have you done?
You're NOT going to faint.
I'll be down in a minute
Oh baby.
What's wrong with you?
What are you drinking?
I try not to drink at lunch-time. Makes me sleepy in the afternoon. You like to keep a clear head, eh?  One soda, one whisky.  I do it anyway. No will-power. Got a busy afternoon?
Well, isn't it?
Why don't you take off your jacket? You're warm.
Why don't you do the same?
Oh Christ.
You're awake. Good girl.
What a pretty tune.
Who's there?
Where are you?
You'd like the house.
Great.
Maybe later in the week. First I've got to find myself a job.
Of course. Every day.
Big house.
I'll show you around when we've got this damn bed moved.
She doesn't even want to leave the house.
It's like she's waiting for something.
He's gone.
No you don't.
I'm here.
Not that late.
All right.  No. That's nice.
Oh!
What?
What did I say?
Do I know you?
Really?  Married Kevin?  Her junior high sweetheart... What chance would I have had against that?  None, no chance.  That's just fate.
Since you brought that bullshit tape in.
You just drove a fucking customer away, Barry.
Barry, I'm fucking broke!  I know we used to fuck with anyone who asked for anything we didn't like, but it's gotta stop.
It wasn't even his terrible taste. It was his daughter's.
Okay.  Top five side one track ones. Number one... "Janie Jones," the Clash, from The Clash.
"Thunder Road," Bruce Springsteen, from Born to Run. "Smells Like Teen Spirit," Nirvana, Nevermind.
Shut the fuck up, Barry.
Don't be sad, Barry.  You'll find true love someday.
They were fucking called that before I was in it, okay?  It wasn't my idea.
Great!  That's fucking great!  They only asked you to sing because of your name!  You can stick it above the browser racks over there.
Of course I'm not coming.  Do I look like I'd want to listen to some terrible experimental racket played in some hideous cave?  Where is it?  The fucking Bucktown Pub?  Ha!
That's what I said.
He's got one!
Anna.
"Somebody's Gonna Die" by Blitz. "Bella Lugosi's Dead," Bauhaus. It's got that creepy Halloween feeling.
Uh.  That's me.
Sure, but is that it for the list?
Rob, hi, so sorry I missed your call. In LA on business.  You know how it gets.
I always hated this song.
Well we rang $900 today.
Can I help you?
Yeah.
Good.  So shall we leave it at that then?
Jeez.  He goes on long enough.
Are you coming home?
Look.  Maybe you'll grow up and we'll get it together, you and me.  Maybe I'll never see either of you again. I don't know.  All I know is that it's not a good time to be living here.
I suppose so.
No problem.  If I can ask one question.
But not even before, when he was living upstairs?
I told you I slept with him.
I figured it was.  Where are you?
I don't want to.  Don't need to.  I love you.
I don't really want to talk about it, to be honest.
Don't forget your CDs.
Okay, okay.  I get the picture.
I guess I am.
Guess who I just saw, right by my store?  Ian.  In Starbuck's.  Neat, huh?
Are you alright?
Me?
I can see why you say that.  Look, I'm sorry.  I really am.  The last thing I wanted was... that's why I left, because... I lost it, and I didn't want to blow my top in there, and... look, the reason I fucked everything up was because I was scared.  I just wanted you to know, that's all.
When are you going back?
What?
What about Ian?
What it was like.
Was it like good sex or was it like bad sex?
You know the difference.
But what?
Yeah, you're alright.  But you're certainly not happy.  So what happens if you get happy?  And yes I know that's the title of an Elvis Costello album, I use the reference deliberately to catch your attention. Should we split up because I'm used to you being miserable?  What happens if you, I don't know, start you're own record label, and it's a success? Time for a new girlfriend?
What do you ever do that can't be cancelled?
I'm sorry I've been acting like a jerk.  I do appreciate what you've done for me, and I know you've done it for the best possible reasons, and I do love you, even though I act like I don't.
Well forgive me if I don't think of you as the world's safest bet.
No.  Probably not.
About what?
To think I sympathized with you for two seconds!  Poor Rob!  Laura left him out of nowhere for the schmuck upstairs.  You let me believe that!
Rob!  Two years ago you got Laura pregnant; you then proceeded to cheat on her!  You borrowed money from her and never paid a dime back!  And then, just a few weeks ago, you told her you were unhappy with her and were "kind of looking around for somebody else!"
Enough, Liz.
Only because it's never the time.  I can't go on apologizing my whole life, you know?
Is that why you came to Chicago in the first place?  Because of, you know, dividing up your record collection and stuff?
What do you mean, the Crumblers? You know the Crumblers?  Nobody's heard the Crumblers.  Except me.
The Conformist.
That way.
I'll call you.
Yeah?
Hi, Mom.
But you must have --
It must have taken him a long time to get them together.
Oh, come on!  Let me give you ten dollars for this, and you can give the rest away for all I care.
Eno import.  Sigue Sigue Sputnik. Break beats.  Serge Gainsbourg. Ryuchi Sakamoto, Syd Barrett... What's going on here?  Are you guys stealing for other people now?
I think you have more.
It's rough.  But it shows promise. We record a couple of songs right, in a studio.  I'll take care of the rest.  I'll put out your record. Any profits after recouping expenses get split down the middle, between us and you guys.
I can't figure out why he's doing it. He's been Richard Taupin at least since 1967.  And the guys rich.  You should see the stuff he has in that shop.
Well, the cream of society awaits.  If you're ever in the neighborhood...
Didn't look like it came from "Toys-Are-Us", that's why I called you.
Figured you knew more about swords than I did.
Huh?
Don't know about any of that. Suppose nobody does.
Have you spoken to anyone else about this?
Charming guy, Basil.  Once after beating an army of Serbians he blinded all but-
What will you do now?
I left a man dead in Felton.  But you don't really care, do you?
I'm a historian, Mr. Taupin. Only once in a lifetime do you stare history in the face.
You're wrong.
You did kill those men.
You want me to front for you.
No.  So what now?  We just wait?
Here, try this.  I suppose they're still making women the same as back then.
William Taupin seems to have left his mark.
And you are William Taupin, aren't you?
You're using your son's name.
It's frightening sometimes the way you talk about other people's lives.
I hope I never get that old.
Who are you?
Perhaps.  There is something more. An inheritance.
I liked the bit you did about Baltic chastity belts. Too bad no one else did.
Someone should check him out. Maybe a collection somewhere got knocked over.  He has one, he might have two.
You're not from these parts.
Aye.
How can you know this?
Listen to me.  Hear the words.
How can I stop such a man?
Harder!  You swing like an impotent cow!
You have a gift.  One you must protect.
The Fabric of life.  The spark that allows the passing of existence from one generation to another.
You must be.  You have responsibilities. You must learn the rules.  You can never attract attention to yourself, never show the side that will draw others to you.  You will always know when you are in the presence of another.  Beware. But more importantly Conor MacLeod, will be your battle against time.  In the coming years you will see kingdoms rise then rot like wheat.  People will become a transitory, pathetic lot.  The only constant you will know will be the others and the tradition their greed and quest represent.  But life without morality, without the ability to truly taste the sweetness of wine and love, is no life at all.  That is how the others exist.  Nothing more than walking corpses living only to slaughter each other in an insane quest to be the last.  Keep your soul sewed to the earth.  Do not become one of them.
There's rumor in the village. Some call it magic.
Please not be touching me, Conor.
Not so scared.
Our common heritage.  I am your only real friend, you know.  The only one who truly understands you.  I look forward to the day we meet again.  And I kill you.
Eat up Dupont.  It will probably be your last.
Your name?
I thought I gave orders the regiment was to drill.
What is your position?
We must talk.
Are you sure?
How are you?
How did you find me?
No, seriously.  We used to shoot pool together in Rangoon.
The pressure only comes when you let the taste slip into your mouth.
Long time.
You've been here from the start.
Friend of yours?
You disappoint me.  I thought you'd finally gotten over that sort of thing.
What's the point!  You have me, finish it!
We have some unfinished business.
What were _you_ looking for?
A claymore to be exact.  You wouldn't know anything about it would you?
My condolences.
Look, I don't know what the hell you're up to, but I think I've got a pretty good idea.
Steven, Conor didn't die.
Sure take after him.  Never seen a father and son look more alike.
The resemblance is amazing.
Such a pretty day.  If I live to be 90 I'll never tire of mornings like this.  Mind you I'm 74 now.
Hello, Harvard! Got anything new on the hanging?
Ready? The Sheriff's just put two hundred more relatives on the payroll to protect the city against the Red Army -- which is leaving Moscow in a couple of minutes.  Up a dime.
Who is it?
Oh, did you -- care for the poem, Mr. Burns?
Of course!  Roy Bensinger, the poet. Of course you wouldn't know! You probably never heard of Shakespeare, either! Put Mr. Bensinger right on the staff.  How much are you getting on the Tribune, Roy?
I don't use my wife for business purposes, Mr. Burns!
All right, dear.
Oh, I realized right away. He's really a very nice fellow, Hildy -- I found that out.
No -- but I'm sure it'll be all right with Walter.
Did you give her the money?
Then suppose you give me the money. Four hundred and fifty dollars.
I know I wasn't a good husband, Hildy, but you can always count on me.
Mighty nice little town, Albany. They've got the State Capitol there, you know.
Gee, you almost make me feel like a heel -- coming between you.
Well, Bruce, here you are -- certified and everything.
Ts! Ts! Ts!
I'll find her, Bruce, if I have to put every detective in the city on the job. Tell you what -- go over to the Missing Persons Bureau and describe your mother. What does she look like?
Who do you think you are, breaking in here like this?
I'll show you what I'm doing. Burns, you're guilty of obstructing justice and so is the Morning Post. I'm going to see that the Post is fined ten thousand dollars for this.
Hartman, if you take this desk out of this building, I'll put you behind bars.
This is the Morning Post you're talking to!
How long is what?
Let's see. I was in Reno six weeks -- then Bermuda... Oh, about four months, I guess. Seems like yesterday to me.
I'll always remember it. If I hadn't remembered it, I wouldn't have divorced you.
Done what?
Well, why did you promise me you wouldn't fight the divorce and then try and gum up the whole works?
A fellow your age, hiring an airplane to write:  'Hildy: Don't be hasty -- remember my dimple. Walter.! It held things up twenty minutes while the Judge ran out to watch it.
Was it my fault? Did I know that coal mine was going to have another cave-in? I meant to be with you on our honeymoon, Hildy -- honest I did.
Well, go on and take it. Work for somebody else! That's the gratitude I get for --
I made a great reporter out of you, Hildy, but you won't be half as good on any other paper, and you know it. You need me and I need you -- and the paper needs both of us.
You've got to help me, Hildy.
If you won't do it for love, how about money? Forget the other offer and I'll raise you twenty-five bucks a week.
All right -- thirty-five, and not a cent more!
You can't sell me that, Walter.
Not what you'd call rich. Makes about five thousand a year.
The quicker the better. Well -- I finally got out what I came in to tell you.  So long, Walter, and better luck next time.
Then what does he want with you?
Allow me.
I suppose I can't call this off without creating a scene -- but remember, it's your last fling.
No, Bruce, dear. Don't you see? This is a trick to get your sympathy. No, Walter, I've been waiting for something like this -- but I wasn't sure when you'd spring it. If you want to save Earl Williams' life, you can interview him yourself. You're still a good reporter. Bruce and I will be on that four o'clock train -- and thanks just the same.
What do you mean, only an act? Haven't you got any feeling?
Exclusive? That's great.
Never mind that. What's the story?
Walter! D-did you see --  -- that?
Not if he's inside the desk. We'll carry the desk over.  Give me Duffy!
Hildy!
How about the time he had his house painted by the Fire Department?
Listen, did you impress it on Butch that I want him and his gang here right away? You did? Every minute counts. All right.  Duffy's getting old!
Double-crossing swine!
Don't tell me -- was she killed?
Who?  Hello, Butch! Where are you?
When did you deliver this first?
Worried! I was petrified. Weren't you?
We've certainly been in some swell jams.
Suit yourself, kid. This isn't for me to decide. Of course, you could make a later train and still be in Albany tomorrow morning.
He's going to have you the rest of his life, Hildy. Can't you give me another hour?
Hildy!
What do you mean? Bruce'll be waiting for you in Albany.
That's what makes it romantic. Every other married couple goes away on a honeymoon and for two weeks the bride knows just where the groom is, and vice versa. But us -- you never know where I am and I'm not sure where you are. That's Romance!
How about Bruce's?
Louie, take this lady over to Polack Mike's and lock her up. See that she doesn't take to anyone on the way.
Come on, Sheriff. We've got to get bail.
Oh, dear! Oh, dear!
Butter-fingers! I give you an old lady to take somewhere, and you hand her over to the cops!
Now everything's fine. She's probably squawking her head off in some police station.
Cooley, I want to talk to you.
Yes, shaking hands. I don't take a very good picture, though.
Better let us in on it, Mollie.
So have we!
You can send somebody with me if you don't believe me!
Johnson, I'm going to the bottom of this. What do you know about Williams? Are you going to talk or aren't you?
He's harmless.
If the Mayor wants me, he knows where I am.
A fine fair-weather friend you are!
After all I've done for you --
Read it! Insane, he says.  He knows very well that Williams ain't insane!
Well, wait a minute, will you? I'm in conference.
Pete, I want to talk to you!
I mean I'm scratching your name off the ticket Tuesday and running Czernecki in your place. It's nothing personal. And, Pete -- it's the only way out. It's a sacrifice we all ought to be glad to make.
Now, Pete! Please don't appeal to my Sentimental side.
Williams ain't a Red, and you know it!
I know it! But they've got nothing to do with this case! Do you realize there are two hundred thousand votes at stake and unless we hang Earl Williams we're going to lose 'em?
Dementia praecox Oh-h-h!
Tell 'em the party is through in this State on account of you.
What is it?
Tell 'em to hold the wire.
All right. Tell 'em to shoot to kill.
I'm telling you. Can you imagine bumping into a load of cops?! They come rollin' out like oranges!
Who is it?
Certified, eh? Who is it -- your milkman?
Hello, Hildy. I thought you were gone.
Four hundred and fifty and I'll cut your throat if you try any tricks!
You know it is!
No -- and you don't know that your cheap boss has had Mr. Baldwin arrested again -- do you?
Hildy, I thought you were gone --
It's the only answer. Everything has a use and if we let it be used for its purpose, we could solve all our problems. Food was meant to be eaten, not stored away in restaurants while poor people starved; clothing was meant to be worn, not piled up in stores while people went naked. Doesn't that make sense?
You're not going to phone anybody where I am.
Earl, you don't want to hurt your friends, do you?
Earl, there's just one thing I ought to clear up for the interview.
Come on, Mollie. This is no place for you. 
Where are they gone? You know where they are?
What do you want?
How much do you make a week? What's your salary?
Who? Me?
This puts me in a peculiar hole.
Here's the picture of my wife.
Never let a rat creep up on you.
You're a dark horse, bowling googlies at your age. Toss me up another.
I never was.
I know a secret.
Well go on then. You can't join if you can't answer.
That word is special. That word is only for something really important. Now, repeat after me... Bugger off.
Now put them together. Bugger off, you bloody sod.
He's never going to come back. He's gone off to be a soldier and Mummy doesn't even know.
You wouldn't.
Go and ask her if she wants to play.
I suppose they're still learning, that's why they keep moving about.
The next one is ours. Either it hits us or it goes past us.
Now, the googly looks like a leg break, but it's really an off break. Got it? Like this.
Who pays for them?
Root it out Clive... the thought of it, before it takes hold.
Consider Grace, the kids. I love them like my own. And you.
What about it?
Why not?
I don't understand. Is there any point to it?
We all had to write a last letter home.
You mean they let you go through the officer training course and then said you were too old for a commission?
I'm glad you didn't send them to your aunt.
I doubt if a few bombs would wake up Dawn on a Sunday morning.
And where do you think you're going?
I want him. I want him so much. I'll kill myself if I can't have him.
What is it, pet?
What did he say?
I don't believe this is happening to me.
It looks a bit fishy to me.
It's not fair on them. It's selfish to keep them with you.
It's so far way. I couldn't bear it.
I didn't mean it like that, Grace. Why does it always come out wrong?
Yeah, it's a tree. I used to play there all the time. But, you can't find it without me. Outsider can't find no deadwood.
Maybe, maybe, maybe... hey, you know what word I hate?
Ma, Tiny's in.
Take his gag out, it's more fun with the screaming.
Aw, I was going home to my Mamma's house... yeah, I was out doing this thing.
Which way?
I guess I'll try to back it out on the rim... at least to the main road.
OK, whatever. Let's go get your brother's truck. Faster we get the truck, faster we get out of here.
Is your brother ready to go?
Um, yeah sure, I guess.
No! He's one of God's creatures, he can't help it if he's dumb... I'm just crazy about animals.
I'd like to see that.
Wondering what?
You all sure are buying a lot of holy water for two people.
Yeah, yeah...  ...I like to fuck shit up.
No, no I think it's really interesting.
As far a hot... goes I gotta go with... Ruth Ann Moorehouse.
I'll let it slide, she was only seventeen.
Yeah.
Holy crap. You gotta see this place. It's awesome.
Jesus Christ, Jerry.
Don't forget the flashlight, it's pretty dark out there.
Fuck! We are fucked!
Just grin and bear it.
Sounds like a magical trip through the heartland.
I hope to Christ she doesn't expect us to wear these things.
How much is a person supposed to stand?
Come on, get with the facts.
And...
I... I got back a stack today. Some nice shots.  See, a good topless June Wilkinson... unfortunately she personalized it...  to Stucky, love June.
I'm sure that ain't the only place he's sticking those pencils.
Goddamn.
I always loved that mute broad that Chuck Heston was shacking up with.
Ya hear me? You bust that crapper and I'll beat your ass.
No, he's just joking. We don't really have any plans other than spending the night at my Dad's house...  ...which is where we were headed when our car broke down.
How long is that gonna take?
Aw, come on. It will be fun.
So what?
I can't... I can't move my arms. I hurt so much.
Oh yeah, yeah I've driven by that place before. I seem to remember a crabby old bastard in a crummy clown suit running the place.
Too late. You're in for life, let's move it out Private Shutterbug.
It will be nice to have a few days off to regenerate. This trip is fun, but it's starting to get brutal.
I think I'm going fucking crazy.
I still don't.
Excuse me, may I please use your phone?
Holy Jesus, somebody had themselves a field day beating the shit outta this thing.
God damn.
What'd ya got there?
Bye sweety, we could of been great together.
God damn it, I must be fucking crazy to let him go off with that crazy fucking bitch.
This is way too fucked up for words.
I'm with Denise, can't we just walk to someplace, this is getting fucking stupid.
Questions? Well, heck, I'll tell you anything you want to know.
Please, just a minute.
Otis! Otis! Come quick, there's cops outside.
Shit, don't these packrat hillbillies throw anything away?
Jesus Christ.
Well, all we know is the kids were headed out to a spot the locals call Deadwood to play Nancy Drew with some local legend about this character everybody calls Dr. Satan.
You know, your hyper sensitive Spidey senses... like Spider-man...  ...you know, like in the comics.
You know, his senses start tingling... when he was approaching danger and shit.
Yeah it's horseshit, just some boogieman crap that the kids like to scare each other with.
I'm gonna see if anybody's home. You and Mr. Willis take a look around the grounds for any sign of anything.
Wydell.
Oui. Nathan's silk suit, just like you asked.
You remind me so much of Nathan plus so much of my little mongrel doggie.
Let's go eat, I'm starved.
I have had such a difficult time in my personal life and you seem to be such a nice man... but I'm talking too much again, no?
I was in my p.j.'s when I remembered I left some papers I need to go over.  See? I rushed right out of the house. I must look a mess. I'm so embarrassed.
Oui.
Shall we close up, then?
Yet you look so sad. A great man like you should not be sad.
Really? I always think myself so ugly. No, not ugly, but plain. A wallflower.
Thank you so much. Merci. It's very wonderful to hear a man say such a nice compliment.
What is wrong, my darling?
Dr. Bronfman's line. Yes. One moment please.  Lila.
Isn't Puff doing spectacularly, honey?
What is it?
Gabby, you know I'm trying to sort things out.
I love you so much, Gabrielle.
Call you back.  You bastard! What do you want?
So we've got seventeen new bookings for speaking engagements, my wonderful men.
Yes, please, somebody ask him what is wrong.
I want our boy back.
A little resistance would be nice, damn it.
You what?
No. This is the end of the road. There's a dead human being here. For all of his faults, he was a human being, and certainly a victim of his culture as much as anybody.
You still in the market for a real boy?
Cause there's this guy. My brother knows him. Might be right up your alley.
I don't get that. Is that sexual?
My brother says the guy's a thirty- five year old virgin, so maybe he won't know how women usually feel. Plus he's got bad eyesight, almost legally blind, which is helpful in this situation. Plus he's got an extremely small penis, of which he is "mortifyingly ashamed", so chances are he'll be so grateful for any non- judgmental attention, that he'll be yours forever.
My brother says things are going really well between you and Nathan.
Don't throw that away. I had that once with a guy. But I threw it away for a cheap thrill.
I don't know, honey. I don't know. Maybe he just didn't want to get involved.
I'm going to miss you.
I'll be in touch.
No no. I'm a psychologist, but I do research. I'm a behaviorist. I work with animals. Mice at the moment.
I'm sorry?
Boy, this is good!
It's just that I have some peculiarities, and...
You do?
Do you? Oh do you, darling?
Shaving cream?
Oh, and the sun block?
I think I'll get Johannsen in chemistry on that.  Oh! Did you bring the first aid kit?
We could call it "Quit Bugging Me, Sunny."  Get it? Sunny. S-u-n-n-y.
No. Too... upright. Might've been a person.
You'll catch cold. It's cold.  What do you suppose he is, a survivalist?
Feral? Don't touch him! He might be diseased! He might... My God, rabies!
I think we should go. Please. Before he wakes up and, I don't know, eats us, or whatever feral things do.
Feral, huh? Totally uncontaminated?
It's perfect!
Don't you see? He's my Tabula Rasa, my Eliza Dolittle. He's my ticket to the top of the Behaviorist food chain. He's going to make me famous.
What are you doing in there?
Who is it?
I'm the same person I was before you knew, damn it! Oh God!
Because I'm really trying, you know. Rosie says maybe only another two years of the elctrolysis.
Oh!  I didn't see you there, sneaky boy!  You're like a boy sneaking in...
Oh yes, baby! I think that this is a wonderful project you're doing, taking this poor unfortunate, uncivilized creature and turning him into a human being! What a wonderful wonderful compassionate man you are!
Who needs it? I have you and I have being a woman and I have thinking about womanly things! I love being a woman because...
Such as my man and how to please him!  Such as making wonderful dinners for my man!  Such as looking pretty for my man!  And I'm writing an article on quilting for the Ladies Home Journal!
I think he's ready.
I'm going to go down and check on Puff. See how he's holding up.
So he's doing okay?
Aha! Finally. I've covered almost the entire seaboard and parts of eastern Ohio.
Shut up!  I gave you... life. I created you in my image, Puff. I took you from this primordial ooze and brought you into the world of culture and art and manners. And this is how you repay me? By heading back to the ooze first chance you get? I should leave you here with Lila the ape woman. It would serve you right, you ungrateful piece of crap. But I'm not going to. You're too valuable to me. Totally selfish of me. You serve my purpose. But if you had any smarts you would realize that I serve your purpose as well. Life is so much more delightful when lived in a silk suit.
Oh boy!
Free to come and go as you please. There's some "mad money" in the night table drawer.
And of course to you, my sweet, for your... moral support.
Ugnh.
Let's be reasonable human beings here. We're all reasonable human beings, aren't we?
So anyway, that's the nightmare I've been having lately.
Oh, I see. Yes, that's something to think about. That's very good. That's what you get the big bucks, right? Ha ha.
I love Lila. I mean, she's a wonderful person. And... she loves me! That's no small potatoes. I mean she really loves me. She's sacrificed so much to be in this relationship with me. And she's a good person. A truly good person. How rare is that in this world, eh? And how could I stop loving somebody because of a little physical imperfection, if it can even be called that. I mean, God knows I'm not perfect! What about my eyesight? It's lousy, that's what! Lila's not going to leave me because of my eyesight. What about my penis?
Yes.
What makes you know so much? How do you know what Eddie was thinking?
Yeah, I think we do. We could try to cut each other up. But that would be bad for everybody. Bad for me, bad for you. And worst of all, be bad for Eddie.
For what makes the world go round. For money, and for glory.
You bastard.
Put it on the bed. That's the way it's done, isn't it?
That seems a shame. The night is young.
Hey, mister.
Okay?
Only when I work.
You're damned right I'm sure. Everybody's got talent. I got talent. You think you can play big-money straight pool, or poker, for forty straight hours on nothing but talent? You think they call Minnesota Fats the best in the country just 'cause he's got talent? Nah. Minnesota Fats's got more character in one finger than you got in your whole skinny body.
He drank as much whisky as you did.
See that big car parked out by the fireplug on the way in? Well, that's mine. I like that car. But I get a new one every year because I make it my business to know what guys like you and Minnesota Fats are gonna do. I made enough off of you the other night to pay for it twice over.
Eddie, you're a born loser.
Sure, you got drunk. That's the best excuse in the world for losing. No trouble losing when you got a good excuse. And winning! That can be heavy on your back too. Like a monkey. You drop that load too when you got an excuse. All you gotta do is learn to feel sorry for yourself. It's one of the best indoor sports: feeling sorry for yourself -- a sport enjoyed by all, especially the born losers.
Ten reasons. Maybe fifteen. And also there's something in it for me.
Seventy-five per cent.
I never saw you do anything else.
Everybody who can hurt me, everybody who can help me. It pays.
The first match I got in mind for you is in Louisville, Kentucky.
He's a gentleman. Gentleman gambler. He gets his kicks playing with hustlers. He's got an old Southern mansion with a pool table in the basement, drinks eight-year-old bourbon, smokes cork-tipped cigarettes.
You must have a lot of confidence in me.
You know, that's real sweet music in there. You can almost smell the action and the money. You know, I can feel it right down in the bottom of my shoes.
What's the matter? What happened?
How do we stand?
I can beat him.
Eddie?...  YOU OWE ME MONEY!
Fifty per cent?
Boy, we really gave it to her good.
Maybe. You want to play?
Okay, I'm Eddie Felson. I shoot straight pool. You got any straight pool shooters in this here poolroom?
Yeah, that's right.
Druggist supplies. Buster here is gonna get an award.  No, he sold seventeen thousand bucks' worth of stuff last month. Fastest boy in the territory.
Looks more like a morgue to me. Those pool tables are the slabs they lay the stiffs on.
The pool game is over when Fats says it's over.
Ah, get with it, will ya, Charlie?
Well, maybe that's it. I'm chicken.
Is this all we got left?
Hello, Charlie...  C'mon in...  That's my girl.
You walked out on me like that. No goodbye, no nothing. Like a thief in the dark. We were partners. We were more than partners.  He was like a... like --
Yeah, yeah, like a son.  I've known this boy since he was sixteen. The first time I saw him, back in Oakland, I said, "This is a talented boy. This is a smart boy."
HOW MUCH?!
C'mon, c'mon, just give me the money.
You still don't see it, do you, Charlie? You are nothing but a small- time Charlie. You'd love to keep me hustling for you, huh? Wouldn't ya? I mean, a couple more years with me, scuffling around them little towns and those back alleys. You might make yourself enough to get a little poolroom back in Oakland. Six tables and a handbook on the side. Is that when you say goodbye to me, Charlie?
Just like that?
What time?
I thought we came here to play pool.
Beautiful shot, Felson. Beautiful. You've played billiards before, Mr. Felson. Ah, you gentlemen sure you don't care for a drink?
Like to raise the stakes, Mr. Felson?
There it is. I'm broke.
Yeah. You must come again.
Who's he?
Hey, I'll tell you what -- I'll play you jack-up pool -- just keep one hand in my pocket.
Gimme ten bucks.
You quittin' too?
You sure you don't want to quit, friend?
Long wait for a bus?
Same reason you went: at that hour of the morning you haven't much choice. Besides, I only live three blocks from there. Where do you live?
So why go to college?
What do you do on the other days?
What time is it?
I got my things over at the hotel. I'll bring them over later...  Come here.
Where you been all day?
You know, I've been living here for almost three years. Now in three days it seems as if I know everybody. When I pass people on the street I want to stop and say, "Listen, I got a fella."
Eddie, where do you go when you go out?
Oh, stop talking about yourself like you're a lush or something. I don't like it.  Maybe you ought to go to a clinic, get some treatments.
I'm hungry.
Give it back to me.
Who is it?
He knows. A lot.
A week? A year?
I'm going to Kentucky. To Louisville. With a friend. Try to make some money. I need it, the money. I'll be leaving early in the morning.
Oh, grow up.
Go on back to the hotel.
Fats, I got about two hundred dollars here.
Shoot pool, Fast Eddie.
...you shoot a great game of pool.
It is not arguing to speak the truth.
How much do you remember?
Who is this?
Was this -- "beautiful?"  Before?
What choice did I have -- ?!
Do you still want me to stay?
Good evening.  Did you have a pleasant day today?
Son ... are you awake?
Wow.  Look at the mountains.
There are more this year than last.
... and Rigel.
Are you sure you saw that?  In the rain -- it may have <u>looked</u> like it changed shape --
Are you all right, Dad?
It was so real, Dad.
It's probably the solenoid.  Take it back to Gleason's, they said they'd fix it if we found anything wrong.
What do you mean -- gone?  What the hell kind of a nurse are you, anyway?
Hello, this is Ms. Magnuson speaking.
Mr. Gardner, I --
This is where it was -- the tunnel opening.
No.
No one comes here after dark.
You're looking for life?
Mom.  I gotta talk to you.
What do you want?
This is not the time or the place to have this same old discussion.
In case you haven't noticed, we're in a little bit of a crisis here.
I can't leave. We have to tell this to the President.
Better be. You left me for him.
David thought I was having an affair, which I wasn't.
Did you try to switch to transponder channels?
I've got a lock on the signal pattern. We can filter it out.
What're you talking about?
A countdown to what?
You have any idea how long it takes for those things to decompose?
I'm only saying, it's been what? Four years, you still haven't signed your divorce papers.
It's the White House, for crying out loud. You can't just drive up and ring the bell.
Not listed, huh?
Perfect, she's using it.
Dad, please...
I'll see how they're doing with the radio transmitter.
I have a confession to make. I'm not real big on flying.
Must be thousands of them. What are they doing?
General Grey, co-ordinate with Atlantic Command. Tell them they have twenty five minutes to get as many people out of the cities as they can.
Is my wife in the air?
Any news on my wife?
Where are they?
How're we doing?
Grey, you read me?
You said you were on leave for the Fourth.
You know, you're not as charming as you think you are.
That is an affirmative. I have victory dance. Mmmmmmm.
Stop it.
I couldn't find anything. Everyone is packing up, they're leaving. Word is a space ship is heading this way.
I'm not leaving.
Why the hell wasn't I told about this place?
Call them back.
Where do your people come from?  Where is your home?
Can we negotiate a truce? Is there room for co-existance?  Can there be peace between us?
What do you want us to do?
Oh, what?... your servant, sir.
Yes.
Yes.
Venice, Italy!
It's Dad's Grail Diary. Every clue he ever followed. Every discovery he made. A complete record of his search for the Holy Grail. This is his whole life. Why would he have sent this to me?
But if you want facts, Indy, I have none to give you. At my age, I'm prepared to take a few things on faith.
Henry, the pen --
The Word of God...
This is a castle. And we have many tapestries. But if you're a Scottish lord, then I am Mickey Mouse.
The Arthur Legend. I've heard this bedtime story before.
Hard to resist, isn't it? The Holy Grail's final resting place described in detail!
Doctor Jones?
And my mother's ears. But the rest belongs to you.
Fraulein -- will you permit me?
Except he's lost, and I'm not.
Wouldn't it be wonderful if he were here now to see this?
Uh-huh.
This one. I think he's in here.
This book contained a map -- a map with no names -- precise directions from the unknown city to the secret Canyon of the Crescent Moon.
You came back for the book? Why?
Is that what you think of me? I believe in the Grail, not the Swastika.
Oh, it breaks the heart.
I'll never forgive myself --
No! Dad, get your stuff. We've got to get out of here.
If only I could have been with you.
Rats?
They want my diary.
You didn't, did you?  You didn't bring it, did you?
How did you she was a Nazi?
Ooooh... I like the Austrian way better.
Dad!
Stop!
You're going the wrong Way! We have to get to Berlin!
There is more in the Diary than just the map.
What did you get?
A regret. It was just the two of us, Dad. It was a lonely way to grow up. For you, too. If you had been an ordinary, average father like the other guys' dads, you'd have understood that.
Well... I can't think of anything.
Dad -- eleven o'clock!!
Nice landing.
Those people are trying to kill us!
Dad?
Dad?!
"Only the penitent man will pass. Only the penitent man will pass."
The penitent man is humble before God.
The last of three brothers who swore an oath to find the Grail and to guard it.
That car belonged to my brother-in- law.
I'm going after those horses.
I don't need camels.
Where's my father?
Then we'll die.
Who are you?
And why were you trying to kill me?
I believe we're being called to dinner.
Jones isn't in his room. Miss Scott -- my troops are leaving at dawn if you want us to escort you to Delhi --
Who?
The plane crash and your journey here sound -- most incredible.
He's not exactly what we call "a spring chicken".
Listen, Mr. Lal, what do you call the Maharajah's wife?
Miss Scott, you're not making any sense.
Their stories are just fear and folklore.
The newspapers exaggerated the incident.
You understand what he tells us?
I ride with you, Indy?
Next time I flatten him! Did you see his eyes?
He was afraid of you. He knows a tough guy when he sees one.
Give me the stones!
You will go to palace there.
You will find them when you find sivlalinga.
I like the service here.
You don't look very good.
I'll take the extra ticket.  Where's this plane going anyway?
India...
Dream -- nightmare is more like it.
What'd he say now?
Indy! Help me!
Hurry, help me out of here! What're you waiting for?!
What?!
Listen, Willie. Do exactly what I tell you now.
Where'd you find your little bodyguard?
What about the future?
Couldn't keep away, huh?
Five minutes... you'll be back over here in five minutes...
WILLIE?!
Oh God, it's soft -- it's moving!
Let's go! Let's get out of here!
What?
Well, you didn't get your prince, and there goes your diamond.
This is the first time anybody ever cried when I left.
Figures...
I don't appreciate being cooked like a french fry!
...reporting....him... ventriloquism...On a bus
Arrrgh!
Who was it?
Who?
No...no...it's nothing.. Rehearsing a play...  What light through yonder window breaks...It is Al... and he's in my head.
What??? You lose your lease on a condo?
Yeah...Who?
Quit screwing around, this is important.
Look! I didn't ask to be in you. Don't blame me for it. You did it.
I know...it sounds insane.
What are you doing?
Yeah JOE Why there's a little man in my head?
What was that?
What do you mean we.
I did. I brought you back here.
Thanks.
Now what.
Corridor A.
Black suits and helmets.
That's not a good idea.
Who is it?
What do we do?
Who?...  Wait a minute! I'm no agent, secret or otherwise. And..I'm alone.
I don't have any.
I can't do that.
What's wrong with how I carry myself.
Oh yeah, to what?
It's sand.
Beautiful!
This must be business, there's nothing else here.
What do I do?
Wait.
...Joe.
Without your pants.
Yeah. I did it.
Mind your own business.
They both look good to me.
You got a better idea, you tell me. Other than her, there's no one here I know.
Who are they? Stay on them, will you. How can we find out...Wait. The glasses.
Which one?
They're all in it.
Voice stress analyzer.
What is it, your charm?
You're doing great with her.
It's embarrassing.
You shut down your sensors.
Ahhh...works...Ryuji... travel...just business...She's.. Fine Arts, University of Tokyo..
No. What do you hope? AL  I hope. I just hope. That someday, you're real small, and you've got no time. And you got no one to help you. And you depend on me. And you know what I'll do?
Some agent you are.
Better. I found Ryuji.
What do I do?
What next!
I can't...
What are you doing?
What?
He was with Gruner!
I don't trust her.
Do something.
What happened?
Never mind that, where are we now.
Gimme a minute.
You're a lucky man.
Awwww...
What are you doing?
JOE What does some island have to do with this? It's a mistake?
We've ruined his market in Japan.. Where's Dieter?
I'm against it.
I knew you were trouble.
They have stolen state property.
Must be delayed effects of the drug... I'll get him out of here.
Sir?
That crazy guy?
Well, I'm glad to see you. Sorry things broke up like that.
Enough ROmance.
I don't know...the last couple of hours...last few days.
When you do...
Anything....You call us right away. You got that?
Right.
Sergeant Finnegan. Name's right there on the card. Are you sure you're alright?
Don't you want to get out?
Why don't you lie down until you feel better.
Why would we want to hurt you?
Not...complaining, actually.
What?
The poet...something he said...
Let you leave without it.
That was then. This is now. Who am I talking to?
And how'm I doing?
He likes the quiet. They were here last week.
You work for Ryuji?
Were you working for him last night?
Who did?
A chip. Goes in a computer.
The most important one. Can you help me find him?
You don't believe me.
Chiang Cho?
That's not this direction. It's back the other way.
What happened?
He told me what to do.
Riuji?
Water fountain's through that door, down the hall.
Could I have it, please.
That's alright. Just tear it apart.
Mom...what are you doing here?
It will.
He's into kind of little cars, that...
Mom.
P.J.'s.
"Tortious interference"? Sounds like a disease caught by a radio.
CBS does not do that. And, you're questioning our journalistic integrity?!
You are a fanatic. An anarchist. You know that? If we can't have a whole show, then I want half a show rather than no show. But oh, no, not you. You won't be satisfied unless you're putting the company at risk!
So, what are you going to do?
I'm staying right here. Doing my job. Fighting to get my show on the air. You don't like it? Hey, I'll tell you what... fire my ass...
So, now, if you'll excuse me, gentlemen, Mr. Rather's been complaining about his chair again.  As they start to leave...
You can't take that... It's personal property...!
If this holds up, and it very well may not, Mike... but, if it did. And we aired this segment? And CBS was sued by Brown & Williamson? I think we could be at grave risk.
Well, as a "standard"... I'll hang with "is the guy telling the truth?"
Come again?
Is CBS corporate telling CBS News do not go to air with this story?
You ready...?
I can take her.
Uh, what are those boxes?
What do you need at the store?
Right now?
What's going on?
Please don't wash your hands in the sink.
Use the bathroom.
I don't think I can do this... I want to stand by my husband... I really do, Jeffrey. But I don't think I can do this anymore. I am so sorry...
Yeah.
Jeffrey Wigand...
Well, I'm working with someone, now, who was the former head of research at Brown & Williamson, a former corporate officer there.
Well, we'd certainly be interested in making his acquaintance, but without knowing what he's going to do...
It would be better if he called us.
Yeah, I'm here.
...I'd be lying to you if I did not tell you how important it was in the court of public opinion...
We're there.
Yeah.
Lowell.
Lowell.
I've been banished. In lieu of being fired.
I disappeared on you?
Did I get you up?
How many shows have we done? Huh? C'mon, how many?
Oh, how fortunate I am to have Lowell Bergman's moral tutelage to point me down the shining path. To show me the way.
Tell him I will see him day after tomorrow.
Who's that?
Did work.
...protect your sources...! You screwed me! You sold me out!
What do...
This is my house... In front of my wife, my kids?! What business do we have?
You came all the way down here to tell me that?
Talk to me outside the zone of your agreement?
Okay, so, here you are... you go to work for tobacco.  You come from corporate cultures where research, really, creative thinking, these are core values. You go to tobacco... Tobacco is a sales culture. Market and sell enormous volume. Go to a lot of golf tournaments. The hell with everything else.  What are you doing? Why are you working for "tobacco" in the first place?
Hello. You there
You believe that?
I believe that? Yes, I believe that.
Are you talking to me or did somebody else just walk in here?! I never abandoned a source!
No, don't evade a choice you gotta make be questioning my reputation or "60 Minutes'" with this cheap skepticism!
Excuse me. Yeah...
Good. But Jeff...
Lowell, I can't afford --
I don't know how to say this, Jeff, except to just say it right out, so I'll say it. They do not want to air it.
Alright... the ABC Telemarketing Company?
You greased the rails!
"Up to you, Jeffrey. That's the power you have, Jeffrey. Vital insider information the American public need to know." Lowell Bergman, the hot show who never met a source he couldn't turn around.
Just give me an example...
Well, no, look... I mean, there was a footprint. Forget it. It's probably not important at all.  You know, I got a job now. I'm teaching high school. Japanese and Chemistry.  So, what were you calling about?
What do you mean there is no family?
I sent the document forward to Sandefur. I was told that we would continue to work on a substitute, we weren't going to remove it as it would impact sales, and that that was his decision.
My co-counsel, Ron Motley, and I have filed a lawsuit against the tobacco industry on behalf of the State of Mississippi to get the state reimbursed Medicaid costs for treating people with smoking-related illness.  If you'd be interested in talking to us, we'd certainly like to talk to you...
And, he gets out there and he has five strokes on us. He has more concentration than anybody I've ever met. It's spooky how he can concentrate.
Is that a threat?
Your husband, who has beaten you -- repeatedly --
As you are well aware, my previous marriage ended with an unjustified strain on my reputation My motives were questioned. I was slandered in court.
What a touching story.
I am here representing Mr. Dumbarton, on a... matter of some delicacy.
Excuse me?
Well -- I, uh, that is to say Mr. Dumbarton -- would like you to uh, neutralize a, uh, business associate by the name of Marylin Rexroth Doyle Massey uh Dumbart -- uh, Massey.
You're in a rush.
Is this Mr. Dumbarton?
You're calling me a pestilence? That's a hoot!
It's a LeCoultre Revers. You can flip the face, and set it for two time zones.
Do you think I'm going to end up like Herb Myerson, with a colostomy bag instead of a family?
She's rich. We're still married. We have no pre-nup.
Mrs. Guttman, you have testified that you were your husband's sexual slave for thirty-six years, ever since you were married --
So who'd you hire?
You're vulnerable.
Tell me Mr. Massey. What was your performance about this afternoon?
-- we are both sure that's what we want?
Well, when this goes south -- promise you'll have dinner with me?
It has bones. Be sure to swallow one.
Yes? Marylin?
I'm on Sunset. Near the Beverly Hills hotel. Wanna meet me for a drink in the Polo...?
From a -- girlfriend.
Hmmm...
Friends?
Yes? Yes, you do have more experience?
No.
I don't have a ring!
Wasn't she the Judge at my divorce hearing?
Good.  Are those foods?
I don't know. Maybe I should grab my mace. I'm a civil attorney. I have little experience with "the criminal mind."
Nonono. Marylin -- I'm your husband. I'd be entitled to Rex's money. No matter what happened to you.
Marylin. Run. I'll distract him.
Hard to believe this is the way it will end up for us.
We are. And it's winding down.
Are you forgetting about the Atcheson, Topeka and the Santa Fe?
Hello, Rex.
Do you need a Tagamet?
So. Now what?
Wow.
Miles Massey.
Lilly's up.
That stinks. They left you with absolutely nothing. It makes you wonder about the entire legal system. Like Rodney King.
Sarah Sorkin. Ramona Barcelona -- this is Miles Massey.
But you're going through with it?
Yes, I know Howard Doyle.
That's delusional.
-- So much for the icebreakers. What're you after, Ruth?
He divorced his wife -- he married Marylin -- he divorced Marylin -- and he -- remarried his WIFE? What kind of sick --
Where does that leave us?
Time marches on. Ardor cools.
Not in court you can't. Has she retained counsel?
The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars, but in ourselves. Well, let me ask you this: what kind of settlement do you seek? What are, for you, the parameters of the possible?
Wait... He wants to give her...?
Kenneth this is my associate, Wrigley. Wrigley this is my friend, Dr. Beck.
Yes.  It's for your protection, sweetheart. You're the one with the -- the...
Thorstenson Gieselensen. He just separated from his third. He's in fish. He is fish.
OhMary
Yes. I know. Still in the dumps, huh?
Mr. Warne?
don't know. I'd have to see on what you base your claim. I presume you feel you're justified in
What ten thousand?
Who said anything about a reward!
If you had half the brains you're supposed to have, you'd have done it yourselflong ago.
Come on, Ellie. Stop being silly. You know I'm going to have my way.
If you have, it isn't too late. You know how I feel about him. But I want to make you happy. You gave me such a scareIwhen I couldn't find you.  You know, the old pump isn't what it used to be.
Well, if it's as serious as all thatwe'll move heaven and earth to
Why, no . . . Don't be silly.
I'll be going.  Ellie swallows her drink and starts pouring herself another, as King enters.
Why should she? After all
Been sending her meals in regularly?
I haven't changed my mind, Westley, I want you to understand that! I don't like you! I never have!  I never will! That's clear enough, isn't it?
Ellie? Oh, she's no responsibility.
What happened?
Don't want to talk todon't want to talk to anybody. Don't want to see anybody.
We ain't ate nothin' since yestidday.
Hey, hey, aren't you afraid you'll burn out a tonsil?
All right, let it go.
No, thanks. We're not hungry.
What do you think you're doing!
That's a long story, my friend. You see, I don't like sitting on newspapers. I did once and all the headlines came off on my white pants.
Oh, I wouldn't kid you . On the level, it actually happened. Nobody bought a paper that day. They followed me all over town and read the news from the seat of my pants.
It's okay with me. I'm not arguing.
Oh, yeah?
Tell that man not to drive so fast. 
I don't know what you're raving about, young man. And, furthermore, I'm not interested.
Oh, my heavens! It's gone!
What am I going to do now?
See here, can you understand English! I don't want it reported!  Please stay out of my affairs!  I want to be left alone.  A CLOSE-UP of PETER shows him glaring after her.
My ticket?
You'll never get away with it, Miss Andrews. 
Take my advicegrab the first bus back to Miami. That guy's a phony.
Of course I do. What do you mean
Darn clever, these Armenians.
I just had the unpleasant sensation of hearing you referred to as my husband.
Who are you?
You've got a name, haven't you?
High time you got back.
Well, I hope you're not going to dictate whom I can talk to.
Why, you don't have to apologize, Mr. Warne. You'll never know how much I appreciate all this.
He apologized for last night.  Said he didn't know we were married.
Aw, nuts! You're just like your old man!  Once a plumber always a plumber! There isn't an ounce of brains in your whole family!
I did! It was my idea, wasn't it?
Yeah.
And he carried you like this, I suppose.
To be a "piggy-backer" it takes complete relaxationa warm heartand a loving nature.
What!
Sure.
I am. I only work when I have to. Two years ago I got a notion and went to China. There was a war going on. Swell! After a while it got stale. I went down to Tahiti. Just lay on the beach for six months. What could be sweeter?
What are you thinking about?
Oh, they'll stop, all right. It's a matter of knowing how to hail them.
Expert! Going to write a book on it. Called the "Hitch-Hikers Hail."
You think it's simple, huh?
You! Don't make me laugh.
What happened?
Any luck?
I couldn't arrive in New York at three in the morning. Everybody's in bed.
Better go back to your bed.
I hope you got your money.
Congratulations.
Why don't you stay and watch the fun? You'll enjoy it immensely.
I'll bet you're in an awful hurry to get back to New York, aren't you?
Why, that's ridiculous! I was on that busI told them to wait!
Here's your ticket, ma'am.
In about fifteen minutes.
What's the matter?  Where's your husband, young lady
Why, you can't put me out in the middle of the
SorryI didn't mean to
Get out of here!
What's the thousand bucks for?
I wouldn't trust you as far as I could throw that desk.
Thanks, Pal. You saved my life.
What do you reckon that's for?
But what in the world do they want a trumpet for?
Yeah.
Well, you're two up on me now. 
What's the idea?
If you wanna get anywhere nowadays, you gotta keep in touch with all the news, is what I always say.
It's a lotta dough. If I was to run across that dame, you know what I'd do?
Five G'sor I crab the works.
Lucky thing, my running into you. Just the man I need.
A gat! A gat!  Got any fireworks on you?
What's the matter with you! Gettin' yellow?
Sh-sh-sh! Soft pedal, you mug!before I What're you trying to do? Tell the whole world about it!  Now listen, you're in this thingand you're staying in! Get me? You know too much.
You love them, don't you?
You'll keep your trap shut, all right.
If you don'tEver hear of Bugs Dooley?
If this is Oswald, it must be our third Oswald.
Who'd ever thought that goofy Oswald kid would pull off a stunt like an assassination?  Just goes to show, you can never know about some people.  Am I right, Jack?  Well, bless my soul.  Your eyes are as red as two cherries, Jack.  Don't tell me we have another bleeding heart here.  Hell, all these years I thought you were on my side.
Who?
The fact is he's gone, chief, and so's our case.
Yeah, what's the big mystery? Everybody down here knows the guy.
Morning, boys.  Ready for a walking tour?
And the six of us, with almost no budget and in secret, are going to solve the case that the Warren Commission with dozens of support staff and millions of dollars couldn't solve.  We can't keep up with the crimes in the Parish as it is, Chief.
If I'm so far from the truth, why is the FBI bugging our offices?  Why are our witnesses being bought off and murdered?  Why are Federal agencies blocking our extraditions and subpoenas when we were never blocked before?
Can you ascertain if there's Proloid in his system?
I'm a dead man!  From here on, believe me, I'm a dead man.
You still questioning any Cubans?
Dave, I always play square.  No bugs. I'd love you to go on the record, but I"m in no hurry.  Whenever you're ready.
Do you mind if I smoke, Mr. Garrison?
That's not true.  I never met anybody named Oswald.  Anybody who told you that has to be crazy.
No... if he did, I don't remember him.  There were lots of kids in and out... y'know.
No, I never saw him before in my life.
Yeah, now that's true.  I drove to Houston.
I believe the boys got a couple.
Why?  What's wrong?
As a pathologist it was your obligation to explore all possible causes of death, was it not?
I'm going to have to ask the jury to leave the courtroom.
I can't believe you're saying this in the courtroom.
Are we going away, Daddy?
He kept trying to get me to change my story about the shots.  He was getting hot under the collar, and telling the woman not to write when he wanted.
...which is strange 'cause this is less than 20 minutes after the assassination.
If we go to him our investigation'll hit the front pages by sunrise. Blow up right in our face.  Ruby was just given a new trial.  If he has something to say, it'll be there. Susie, what did you find out on Oswald?
Finally they shuttle him to a radio factory in Minks where he lives as high on the hog as he ever has - he's given 5,000 rubles, a roomy apartment with a balcony, has affairs with local girls.
Don't get sidetracked!  How does he get back to the States?  That's the point.  Does he have any problems?
None either.  It's bizarre.  It's next to impossible to get Russian sweethearts out.  Nor does Lee have any problem getting a new passport when he wants to go to Cuba and Russia in '63.  A man who has defected once already.  It's crazy.
All I can find out about the Williams' is their tax returns are classified and that Bill Williams, a descendant of the Cabots of Massachusetts, has links through his family and United Fruit to the CIA and does classified work for Bell Helicopter which requires a security clearance - so what is Oswald, a defector, doing visiting his wife in his house? Williams has a relationship at Bell with General Walter Dornberger, another one of the Nazis we brought in after the War for our missile program.  He used slave labor to build the V-2 Rockets for Hitler before Bell needed him.
I think Clinton is a breakthrough. Shaw denies he knows Ferrie or Oswald. Is that right?  It proves he's a liar.  Keep on it, Bill. 
No, I don't believe I know anyone by that name.
I would imagine a uniformed waiter helps.
No.  I have never known anyone by that name.  Of course never having met Mr. O'Keefe I could hardly have met Mr. Ferrie...
May I go?  Regardless of what you may think of me, Mr. Garrison, I am a patriot first and foremost.
In the sheriff's report, Mrs. Mercer, it says you were at Dealey Plaza two hours before the assassination but that...
No.  I told you I was going to talk to Shaw.
Because when I scheduled it I didn't realize it was a holiday.  You were there, why didn't you say something?
I'm sorry, but it's important.  Clay Shaw is important.  I'm sorry.
Hi.
My sympathies.
That sounds dandy, but it doesn't replace a father and a husband on Easter Day.
Honey, some crackpot.  Martin Luther King was killed in Memphis today!
Get a hold of yourself.
Damn it, if I say I'll spend more time with him, I'll spend more time with him.  I can't fight you and the world too, Liz.
That's not why I'm attacking him! You don't believe me - all this time you never believed me.
For sexual purposes?
One little guy with a cheap rifle - look what he can do.
I'd say he was probably getting intelligence training.
Goddamn Sam!
Time?
That means we gotta subpoena Time- Life on it.
Who do you think changed the parade route?
I will not have any damned ultimatums put to me, Lou.  I'll accept your resignation.
You know, something always bothered me about that from day one, and I can't put my finger on it.
Welcome, District Attorney Garrison. May I call you Jim?
Well, thanks for coming.
Just speculating, I guess.  How do you think it started?
...got promoted to two stars, but he was never military, you know, always CIA.  Went to Vietnam, lost his credibility when we got beat over there, retired, lives in Virginia. I say hello to him when I see him at the supermarket...
I knew the man 20 years.  That's him.  The way he walked... arms at his side, military, the stoop, the haircut, the twisted left hand, the large class ring.  What was he doing there?  If anyone had asked him, he'd probably say "protection" but I'll tell you I think he was giving some kind of "okay" signal to those hoboes - they're about to get booked and he's telling 'em it's gonna be okay, they're covered.  And in fact they were - you never heard of them again.
Here's my problem, Jack.  You told me you and Guy were good friends for a long time?
Well, I'd ask Guy - we were friendly, you know - heart attack, wasn't it?
You have other information?
Why did Guy beat you, Jack?
Like I said, a fuckin' nuthouse.
Anyone else involved at Banister's level?
Didn't someone say he didn't speak good Russian?
Hate mail here.  Fan mail here.  The bad news is the IRS has just requested an audit on your income from this office.
How many men are working with you on this?
That's all you've had all this time?
Stop your investigation... it was a magnificent effort but it's over and done with.  The press is already on your behind and that's only the beginning, my boy, only the beginning.
Hello.  Is this Jim Garrison's daughter?
And you get of from school at 3 every day?
Can I make a statement?  If you request me to go back to Washington with you right now, that is if you want to hear further testimony from me, can you do that?  Can you take me with you?
What are they?
Tomorrow I'll talk to your probation officer. Karen's a good kid, but she's mad at you, because you lied to her. This business about your grandmother's funeral
I don't know. Maybe it's a language problem.  Anita, you ever cause this much heartache over something that could easily be avoided, I'll never write you again. You understand?
Naw, man. They just tryin' to put a fright in your ass.
Three years. That crime's old, man. They ain't got room in prison for all the motherfuckers out there killin' people. How they gonna find room for you?
Hey, c'mon in, man. I was just -- you know -- smokin' a fatty, watchin' TV.
Well, I'm sorry, man, but I ain't gittin' in that trunk.
Why were you with him?
And you didn't tell the Police?
Great, you're here.
What's she willing to give us?
Can I have a word with you?
Would I mind? Do I have a choice?
This is your money?
Hey, this is my office. There's no smoking.
I'd love one, but not there.
What have they told you?
But they won't want to take you to trial. They'll offer you simple Possession, a few months of County time, and a year or two probation.  How 'bout another?
He's the one who wants you.
'Cause if he busted you, you'd play hell bonding out of federal court. He doesn't want you mad at him, he wants you to tell him what you know. He uses you to get a line on Ordell, make a case, then take him federal. You know what Ordell's into?
Thanks, but I have my own now.
Somebody loan it to you?
Want to hear some music?
I couldn't wait till I got home last night and wash my hair.
Who is this?
It's a lot of money. About a half-a- million dollars. All of it in Cabo in safe deposit boxes and more comin' in.
He came by.
He had his doubts at first. But he's always trusted me an wants more than anything to believe he still can.
How do you get it out?
I'm asking how you feel. Does it bother you?
It's different with men.
My ass ain't the same.
You talk them into it?
He was here?
You know some interesting people.
No, I mean you, right now. Not it you were somebody else.
You're avoiding the question.
A lot of reasons. But the main one would be I'm tired of it.
Hi, I'm Max Cherry. Your bail bondsman.
If you had a chance, unemployed now, to walk off with a half-million dollars, would you take it?
The feds. It's evidence.
Oh, yeah. I got them thinking Ordell's real nervous. They love thinking he's scared of them.
It'll be more than that.
But you still have to show him the money at the airport.
Get Ordell to come to your office.
Tell him I want to give him his money.
I didn't use you, Max.
I'd feel a whole lot better if you took some more money.
Madrid or Barcelona?
Who's side are you on?
What if I plead guilty?
Sometimes every day, for a while.
And what would this be, Sweet and Low?
Oh, so now you know him?
No shit. You know how he makes his money?
This is A.T.F. agent Ray Nicolet, Jackie Brown, Ordell Robbie money exchange trial run. It's three p.m., July 4th 1997. The location is the parking structure at LAX.
This afternoon before I came here. He was with Ordell at an apartment in Hermosa Beach. I don't know if he lives there, but I can find out.
...Compton with a fifty-six-year- old petty thief -- woman named Simone Hawkins.
Not yet.
It was her coke I got busted with. She knows everything, but she's not part of it, and she's pissed cause she's not part of it. Ordell wouldn't even let her stay at the meeting. She tried to talk me into ripping off Ordell.
We could, if I'm not in jail.
That's fifty thousand, huh? It doesn't look like that much.
Oh, hi.
I'm waiting for the phone.
Sure.
Killian's.
Uh-uh.
You already knew that?
It looks good on you.
I'magine they asked who you givin' it to, too.
Yeah?
Baby, I ain't come here -- She shoves both guns in Ordell's back.
I got a problem...
You a fine lookin' woman, Jackie. I bet you do a damn sight better than okay. You think anybody followed you?
...I make two deliveries. The first one with ten thousand, like a dry run. They watch it. See how it works. Then we do a second delivery, when I bring in the half mill.
If you want.
I was thinkin' the Del Amo Mall. In the food court.
That's an agent. Manager's get fifteen percent.
Drink?
She saw you with Sheronda. So Simone goes to the dress department with her Robinson's/May bag.
Who's paging you?
It's boring, isn't it?
What for?
It's like this major meal in a shake you drink instead of having a big meal.
Which one?
That's not what I'm saying at all.  You know where he went?
Please.
I live here. He drops in and out. He tell you about that half-million dollars he's got in Mexico?
That's a nice outfit on her. I'm gonna go over and look at this Michi Moon display.
I'm carrying it.
Is it this aisle or the next one over?
I mean it. Don't say one fuckin' word.
See, what did I tell you? Man in New York wants a 9 millimeter Smith and Wesson Model 5946. Why does he want it? It's the gun that nigga on "New York Undercover" uses. Because of that nigga, I can sell it to this nigga for twelve-fifty.
I got me five M-60 machine guns. These came straight from the Gulf War. I sold me three of them so far, twenty grand a piece.
Louis, my man. Watcha doin'?
Guess where I am?
What did he do?
I didn't look like a bum.
Can I ask you about Melanie?
What's your relationship?
If this is about you fucked Melanie, I don't give a damn. I ain't a fool. I leave you alone with a bitch like Melanie, you're gonna be fuckin' that twenty minutes after I'm out the door. So say "thank you" and I'll tell you, "you're welcome."
I still don't understand why you keep her around.
Uh-huh.
It's Louis.
Couldn't talk to her?
Louis?
Louis, You tellin' me the truth?
Where you shot her.
Okay, so it was Jackie Brown.
You see Max Cherry in the dress department. We're about to be handed half-a-million dollars -- Man, look at me when I'm talking to you! And you don't think nothing of him being there!
You know the motherfucker's a bail bondsman, don't ya? You know every last one of them motherfuckers is crooked as hell?
How can I help you?
So, you want a ten-thousand dollar bond. What've you got for collateral?
Beaumont Livingston.
Possession of unregistered machine guns.
They do consider this a violation of his probation. Your boy's looking at ten years, plus the concealed weapon.
The bond for possession is only a thousand.
Somebody already did.
Very first motherfuckin' thing they did. They see I put up a big money bond on my boy, they start thinking with that where-there's-smoke-there's fire logic. They roust my ass outta bed, ten o'clock in the morning. Fuckin' scare my woman, Sherona, half to death. She thought they were gonna take my ass away for sure.
Who says she does anything for me? She's my friend. When my friends get into trouble, I like to help 'em out.
That's what the police thought. I told them I'm unemployed, how could I have anybody work for me? Now I bail out Jackie, I'm liable to have the police on me again, huh? Wanting to know was she doing things for me, was she bringing me that money!
Is this, me and you, like a lawyer- client relationship? The lawyer can't tell nothing he hears?
Why would a stewardess bring me fifty grand?
You still there?
I'm alone.
You know what the fuck I'm talkin' about. You talk to her?
How'd you find me?
Jackie didn't trust Melanie. She'd already tried to get Jackie to go in with her, split the half million amongst themselves. What she did was take quite a risk to see you get your money.
This place stinks.
Cherry Bail Bonds.
He's around.
Let me out of here!
Remember?
Hiya Jake. That was some dance.
What do you want?
Well, how do I look?
Dr. Singer. It's been a long time.
Daddy, what was that noise?
There was a bang.
Don't go.
Doctor.  Ph.D.
Half an hour from now and you'll be walking out of here all by yourself. Mark my words.  Well, you've done it to yourself this time, haven't you?
From a slipped disc? That'd be a first.
Perfect. We got it.  Okay. Let's just give it a little try. See if you can stand.
Jake, you need to rest.
And how is your wife? Sarah, no?
No.  I see them.
Christ, I know how it sounds.
Yes.  I don't want them. I'm not looking for analysis or drugs. It's too easy to dismiss as some kind of psychosis.  It's more than that. I can feel it. I need you Prof. You're the only one I can talk to.
What's your name?
I moved the couch. That's all.
You up?
Did you look around the headboard?
What?
Ready?
Jake!
Maybe it's all the pressure, Jake. The money. Things like that. Or your wife.
Oh, come on. It's early.
What do you mean? Where do you think?
Can't you stop it?
You're out of your mind. I'm not getting in there. I'd rather die.
How come? The army?
He said you didn't have one.
It's just me.
Who else were you expecting?
Who was that?
God, I can't keep up with all your changes.
I want to go with you, Jake. Wherever you go.
I can waitress. I'm good.
What're you ... ? Where's Sarah? Where are the boys?
Where are they?
No! What's going on? Where's my family?
Why won't you answer me?
That doesn't mean shit. Where do you come from, huh? And I don't mean Indiana.
Where's Sarah? Where are the boys?
Where are they?
No! What's going on? Where's my family?
So first I'm arrested, right? Best LSD I ever made, right down the drain. I figure this is it, twenty years in the joint, if I'm lucky. That was '68.
No shit. They had me by the balls. Next thing I know I'm in Saigon ... in a secret lab synthesizing mind- altering drugs. Not the street stuff mind you. They had us isolating special properties. The dark side, you know? They wanted a drug that increased aggressive tendencies.
Anyway, this big offensive was coming up. Everyone knew it; Time Magazine, Huntley-Brinkley. And the brass was scared 'cause they knew we couldn't win. Morale was down. It was gettin' ugly in the States. Hell, you remember.
Where's Wong?
No. I'll take the other one.  Right. Well it's good to have you back. See you tomorrow, probably.
He's burning up.
You and everybody else. God I hate this area. Makes me nervous.
I don't know who they are, or what they are. But they're gonna get me and I'm scared, Jake. I'm so scared I can't do anything. I can't go to my sisters. I can't even go home.
Don't do anything.  Paul, I know what you're talking about.
What is it Paul? What's happening to me?
The army?
I don't know. I don't know.
I don't blame him. What should I do with the ice?
Watch it punk, I'm armed.
Asshole that does not count as a kill.
What's that?
When the left hull goes, so will the right.
Bomb?
Can't shut em' down from here.
You see that?
As long as they're connected we can blow them all simultaneously from a safe distance.
Brodski! Get to Lab two. We have an emergency!
I think I speak on behalf of the group when I say this is bad news.
Then what do we do?!
My god! This is way over your head, pal. We need to call some experts and . . .
How do you know that piece of cursed rock down there doesn't carry something metal tits can't detect?
What the hell are you doing?
Yllo, what's your head count?
Lab two, relax. What's the matter? He's dead.
He's dead. They're both dead. You don't understand what is on this ship. This is a being that kills. That's what he does. That's all he does. And he is very good at it.
I doubt that. I think we can handle whatever your ancient hockey player can throw at us.
I need to know what you know about this guy.
Outta here?
Kkinsa, Crutch is hurt! We need access to the shuttle's med-kit or he'll die.
Jason seemed to have the right stuff. Physically, anyway. Radiation, cell damage, didn't matter. He just kept going.
His mother was killed before his eyes. That's what drove him insane. It'll work.
Well?
Shut up! She just wants this thing dead!
We must assume the machete was an intricate part of the game of hockey.
Okay?!!
Close the fucking door!
Hey teach! This rock's starting to freeze! Get your ass back hre!
We've got a situation here! Just do as  you're told!
YeaH, GREAT IDEA! And I'll keep the big guy distracted with a blow job.
No.
I don't know...sorry?
Robot huh?
No...  That's the sound of the men working on the chain gang.
Do I have to?
Kicker!
Leave him behind!
What?
The power's back up!
Damn!  Close the door! I'll be right back.
You son of a bitch, you know what time it is?
I'm sending you the files.
Nano...but nanotechnology is impossible.
Now lay back we need to do some tests and I have some questions...
That's ridiculous. You're overreacting.
You're not going anywhere.
Listen to me. Please. Let's get off thsi ship. Come with me.
Did you bring a check?
It's my charter. My party.
How -- if they're gonna keep on breaking?
I never saw one that big.
Let's call in -- we can radio and have a big boat here in an hour...
That's it! Radio in for help!
He's chasing us! I don't believe it.
Probably out in the back yard.
You're very tight, y'know?  Right there.
Martin!  Are you going to shut down the beach on your own authority?
Now tell me something I don't know.
He lost it on the way up.
Got a pen on you?
Something else. Do most attacks go unreported?
There's a kind of a lone shark, called, uh...
And before 1900, when people first starting swimming for recreation, before public bathing and resorts, there were very few shark attacks, cause sharks didn't know what they were missing?
...And it was Dartmouth Winter weekend, and she was Homecoming Queen, and I was her date; then she got into the fact that her family had more money than my family, and she was right -- her great-grandfather was in mining, and my ancestors were Yankee shipbuilders. So we broke up and I went home with some beatnik from Sarah Lawrence.
What? What?!
...Nothing.
You're at the Institute full time? Or do you have a job?
We will. There's something I've got to find out.
Wait a minute! I need you.
Don't shoot him any more! He's crazy on his own blood already!
Look at him take it!
Here's to your husband, the only other rational man on the island. Day after tomorrow, I'll be gone, and he'll be the only one.
Is it! The best-funded research expedition to ever study the shark... around the world in 18 months.
And I'm not talking about hooking some poor dogfish or sand shark. I'm talking about a Great White.
Watch it! Compressed air -- you screw around with one of those and Boom! Careful, huh?
I'm sorry, Martin. She's in a sick, terrible state.
Paul? Are you coming downstairs to eat?
Go Carole.  So, guess what?
So, what do you think we should do?
Well! Nothing like experimenting.
Oh yeah. I'm kind of a deadbeat lab partner, huh?
I'm going to really start looking like a dork soon. Will you still think I'm cute if I'm huge?
Jesus, Bleek.
I don't like Katrina.
You're mad. Why are you mad?
That's not how our thing works! I hurl the accusations and you talk me down, remember?
Did you put like a hundred things of Tic Tacs in my mailbox?
Well, yeah. You're the best friend I've ever had, even when you're being kind of evil.
We both have shiny happy fits of rage. You want more fans, I want more stage. I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.
Just like our moms and teachers!
Did you hear it's yours?
Well I'm a nail technician, and I think we both ought to stick to what we know.
Nails? Really?
No. The school would probably contact you in the event of my expulsion.
You mean I have to wait for it to get even worse? Why can't they just give it to me now?
No, I mean in your pregnancy.
Amanda, I told you to go to the infirmary and lie down. You never listen.
Whoah. I don't want to see pictures. I don't need to be notified of anything. Can't we just kick it old school? I could just put the baby in a basket and send it your way. You know, like Moses in the reeds.
Whoops! Yikes, I didn't expect to see you up here.
Am I supposed to feel happy now?
Viscera?
What? I'm a pawn shop rocker.
When was this, like '96?
Sure. What is it with you rich people and your herb-infused juices?
I think it kind of looks like my friend, Paulie.
Junk?
I know what junk is.
What is it?
Don't you remember you told me you loved me, baby...
It's the least I can do. What did you say your favorite band was?
Uh, thanks.
Hello?
Cute?
I'm dying to see what you've got to teach me.
Oh God, you're one of those guys...
A baby is not going to fix everything. Besides, I don't know if I'm ready to be a father.
Hi! I'm Vanessa. You must be Juno and Mr. MacGuff. I'm Vanessa.
I'll get drinks. What would everyone like? I've got Pellegrino, Vitamin Water...
The tough part's almost over for you. I mean, my girlfriends always tell me the first couple months are the hardest.
I think pregnancy is beautiful.
Well, shall we start looking over the paperwork? Gerta has already drafted some preliminary documents.
Oh. Sure. Of course you'd want to know how your kid is cooking.
Um, I think people are kind of unsure about the situation because it's not, you know, set in stone.
Well hi Vanessa! What brings you to the mall today?
Oh, okay. So... how are you feeling?
Juno? What's going on?
You should have seen this octopus furnace. I had to get out my Hazmat suit just to get up in there...
Do you need a large sum of money? Legal counsel?
Who is the kid?
Did you say you were thinking about adoption?
I thought you were the kind of girl who knew when to say when.
She's joking. Junebug has a wonderful sense of humor, which is just one of her many genetic gifts.
Excuse me?
Dealing with stuff way beyond my maturity level. Where is everyone?
I guess I wonder sometimes if people ever stay together for good.
Please stop now.
How did you even generate enough pee for three pregnancy tests?
Well, are you going to go to Havenbrooke or Women Now for the abortion? You need a note from your parents for Havenbrooke.
So, what was it like humping Bleeker's bony bod?
But then you'll get huge. Your chest is going to milktate. And you have to tell everyone you're pregnant.
Oh yeah! "Desperately Seeking Spawn." They're right by the ads for like, iguanas and terriers and used fitness equipment. It's totally legit.
The Penny Saver sucks.
Best to just tell them, man. Rip off the Band-Aid and let it bleed.
Aw, please Junebug?
No way! She's pretty.
She's gonna steal that kid for her collection.
Yes. Heating and air conditioning.
Obviously, we'll compensate you for your medical expenses.
You guys are playing music?
I've been just wondering if we're, you know, ready.
Why don't we let Juno go home and we can discuss this later on, okay?
No.
You lose!
...You can forget about 'em forever and then look at 'em and they're doin' even better than before.
One night we figured out how much bad luck he must have comin' from all them mirrors he broke...  Four hundred and ninety four years to work it all off... After he dies, he'll have to keep coming back to earth over and over and over...
You wouldn't have any color film, would ya?
You dropped this.
Better not, or Early'd whip me.
...Hey you're good. Thought you said you never played before?
You know I can fix that haircut for you, if you want?
That's me.
Hold still.
The police are after him, he's a murderer!
I feel kind of like the wizard of oz, you know when she gets the red shoes.
What's up Adele? Dinner ready?
Yeah, and in California you never have to buy fruit 'cause it's all on the trees everywhere you turn...  ...and, 'course there ain't no speed limit out there, and all drugs are legal... And I heard your first month's rent is free; state law. I figure 'til we get settled we can just move around month to month...
Don't be long now, dinner's 'bout ready.
What if they're dangerous?
What the hell is this stuff?
What's wrong with her?
What's your name, boy?
Where you from Walter?
Tight fit.
You gonna talk to the people who did those murders?
That bad?
...They never caught that Black Dolya Killer, huh?
Yeah?
...Well then, that's how many I killed.
Hey... Ain't we getting near the next murder site... Bri?
Tonight turned out to be pretty interesting.
No we can't. We can never leave once you start talking about tenure... and vacation pay... and parking privileges and... oh shit! let's just go to California now, right now, before it's too late.
Look, fuck the thesis. I think there's a book here. Your photographs and my research, together.
We could have been in and out of there in less than ten minutes...
Up yours.
All set?
What is it?
What's that?
Brian I want him out of our car!
Carrie... stop it.
Early, just think...
...Diebold?
Looks like somebody cut off his ring finger.
Have you ever had anal intercourse?
Well, girl. You tested negative for all sexually transmitted diseases and infections.
Well it took me longer than I thought it would take. It took like 15 minutes to talk her into it. But once it was on, we fucked for a good half an hour. I had to keep taking it out and putting it back in. It hurts the first time.
Well, I was flipping through a picture book of her and her family, right.
And there was this picture of her painting Easter eggs or something. And I said, you were cute when you were little.
78th.
Yeah. The way I see it. My outlook on the this situation is.  It's like getting fame, you know what I'm saying. It's like, if you died tomorrow, and fifty years from now all the virgins you fucked are gonna remember you because you were their first.
Can you do it man?
That girl you boned last year. Remember?
Darcy. Benny's little sister.
I'm not joking. I wanted to take my dick out and start jacking right there. At that point and moment, Darcy was like a vision of perfection.
You wanna run by the park and see what everybody's doing? Get zooted?
Shut up.
Hurry up man. Let's be out. I wanna go swimmin'.
Casper, where is he?
You sure?
What?
Sup then? Sup?
Yeah. Come on.
I don't know. I guess it's cause my sister Nicki had a baby when she was like 15. She was really young so my mom is like very protective over me.
Yeah. His parents are away. It's gonna be a bug out.
I just know. I know you'll love it.
I'm telling you. There's nothing in the world to worry about.
This makes Special K look weak. It's a euphoric blockbuster.
Because your a virgin?
No. I'm OK. Thanks.
Are you in trouble with the law?
Now that's it. A smile. You look like a prom queen when you smile. Like a glamour girl.
Oh yeah, sure. When I was a kid I had a crush on the prom queen. Darlene Louis. She had a big black mole in the center of her face that used to get me so excited. Darlene Louis. You know you look a little bit like her.
Telly says was up.
Yep, yep. But he has to know what he's doing and where he's going. Because they can like touch you for hours and they won't ever know.
Wish me luck.
I gotta go. I gotta find Telly.
Just a lot of crazy shit.
Diss digg, diss digg, diss digg.
You know... You know a lot of times sex gets in the way. Has that ever happened to you?
Yeah. The shit gets wacked. Fifteen minutes.
How can you hang out with Casper? He's such a jerk.
I hate 'em.
Hi mom.
Sorry. Dad made me promise not to give you any money until you find a job.
Mom.
Not too late.
Where does everyone sleep?
That's the whole thing. You know if you look at it. I mean all you hear about is disease this and disease that. And everyone's dying. And you better wear a condom or else. But the truth is. I don't know any kids with AIDS. No one I know has ever died from that shit. It's like some weird make-believe story that the whole world believes.
First times are always wacked. Just be glad you didn't lose your virginity in the backseat of a rental car.
Right.
What man? What is it?
I can't man.
Are you crazy?
You know, I figure that's pretty much how these girl's feel just before they get it.  You think I'm right?
You sure you weren't over on Pine Road?
The message!  I figured out--
It'll take hours.  You can't make me do this.
What are you talking about?
Take it easy.  Both of you.
I spoke to Jeremy.  He's watching Sanderson's kid.  Sanderson went out after the match and hasn't come back since.
Sending yourself anonymous notes in the mail is one thing -- but who called him today?
What do you mean, stand out?
We'll find the evidence.
To get your attention.
I suppose you want to know where I'm going to kill tonight, Peter?
I'm just trying to play the game.
And you want these girls to feel your pain?
What?
I know where you are.
This isn't going to help, David. You're mother's dead.  You can't undo it.
What's this?
D2-d4...  b1-c3... and c1-f4.  It's the number two variation of the Tarakoss opening.  David, can you bring up the tournament records for the last ten years.
It worked out alright, didn't it?
You must be Erica.
What are you doing up?
What is it, dad?
Whaddaya got, Nolan?
He tapes their mouths shut.  We found traces of adhesive around the victims mouths.  We're doing a chemical analysis for components, but it's probably a standard brand you can buy in any hardware store.
This is where he forced his way in.  We found some fibers on the windowsill, probably particles of clothing that rubbed off when he climbed through. I'll know more once I get it under the microscope.
What do you think he did?
I'm busy right now.
That would indicate he's playing out a fantasy.  Power-control killers usually fantasize about their actions long before they commit them.  Once they become a reality though, they reach a sense of euphoria and need to repeat the act to sustain it.  But, in all the research I've read on Serial Killers, I've never heard of one moving so fast. It's as if the game is the catalyst for the murders -- not the other way around.
Yes.  Why disguise your voice if no one knows it?
His home would be... Mount Olympus.
Well, I think you have to play to his ego.  He thinks he's superior.  The more secure he feels, the more chances he'll take.
It can't be a coincidence.  The woman that owns it has a son.  She says he's been on vacation in Montana for the last ten days.  We're trying to locate him.  There's also a cleaning service that comes in once a week.  We're checking that out too.
And what if he's wrong.  If you were one hundred percent sure it was Peter you would've arrested him.  If it is someone else then he's going to kill again tonight and you're sitting here ignoring the message.
Excuse me... you said earlier that Mary Albert just moved in.  How long ago was that?
What's interesting about it is you say you only knew her in passing.  Yet, she says on her message for you to call her at home and she doesn't leave a number. That would imply you already knew the number.
Mister Sanderson, this is Doctor Sheppard.  She's a psychologist helping us out.
That's it?
It's a commercial area.  No one lives there.
He's not going to give us direct hints. He's going to skirt around it.
Alright, c'mon Peter.  We're moving you to a cell.
Then I'll transpose.
Peter...
Bainbridge Books.
Of course.  Yes, here it is.  Why, they're all the same?
Is this your first time here?
I thought opening too quickly was a fatal mistake in chess.
In a way.
Oh, but it is.  He's killing a person everyday and challenging us to catch him.  That's a game.  It has rules and objectives.
What about you?  Aren't there times when a young child is telling you a story so sad you just want to cry?
Can you go fifteen minutes without thinking about it?
It was.
This frightens me -- because I'm starting to feel things I haven't felt in a long time.
I'm hungry.
Hi.
The other night -- I said some things that maybe I shouldn't have.  I mean, you haven't known me very long and I can see how you thought what you did.
I was thinking that... maybe when this is all over we could...
Then help me to understand.  I want to understand.
Of course it isn't.  It's always difficult when someone you love dies. But you can't feel responsible because she had a car accident.
Because I know what it says.
Me too.
I am too old to climb down a rope.
You must break when the strain becomes too great, or you will harm yourself. And you must concentrate your powers for when they are needed most. What did she answer?
Yes. Each dawn it rises in a different land: sometimes in the mountains, sometimes in the jungle, sometimes the desert, sometimes the sea. Never in the same place twice.
You have not slept in two days.
You choose these?
<u>Why</u>?
She must make a glaive.
It is my fate to die in the Fortress.
How did you know?
They can be saddled.
I know the cruelty of such a fate.
You too are lonely.
My <u>friend</u>.
I don't think you'll grow careless.
Fame.
It should be an interesting journey, then.
I'm not hungry.
Nothing worse than lower-class boors with upper-class morals.
Tonight and every night, my friend, for this is the second time you've saved my life.  I am Ergo the Magnificent, short in stature, tall in power, etcetera, etcetera.
A venison pie as big as a house.
Sugarballs?
I am Ergo the Magnificent ...  ... short in stature ...  ... tall in power ...  ... narrow of purpose ...  ... wide of vision.
I'm hungry.
One puppy? Why not wish for a hundred?
But also very young. Six to one is no odds, boy.
Food for crows.
I am being exploited! Where are you going?
My spells always go wrong when I am observed. Be gone!
He was aiming a huge spear right at me!
It's a lie!
Modred! Impossible!
The new King.
It is the time.
We'll seek an Emerald Seer. They have great powers of vision.
Yes.
Perhaps she will not kill me, for I know her name.
Each to his fate, lad.
We must reach the Valley of Reeds before the next dawn.
Look.
You had a son.
Do not try your trickery on me!
A young man seeks her. A young man about the age I was when I met you.
You will come with me.
Yeah, pal! And I didn't say anything, I said I don't know you.  But do you know what did she say, that stupid Raphaella?
...Good...  But what's special in him?
No, no.
Take...
OK, I'm fine.
Well, if the guy is far, in a car, and I know weather is going to be bad, rain for example, I think I would plastic the car, with a remote here. I shoot from the distance and if I miss I plastic.
Rocket launcher.
The fat man down there, on the bench.
I was nervous, that's all! Where is the guy?
May I go to the cinema?
For musicals?  That's part of the job!
...You can leave whenever you want. I don't refrain you.
...I'm going to kiss you.
...You don't believe me, don't you?
...OK.  I love you anyway.
...Shit!!  We'd found him. We waited for him to get upstairs and he got out of the window.
You're darkening the picture, aren't you?
Mathilda... There's equally a lot of other things!
No, excuse me... It's the yogurt that made me laugh.
Yeah, I know! But for the moment you're not yet a woman. So, be patient... I need time... And you too. You have to grow up.
How many girlfriends did you have?
...I had a girlfriend... A long time ago.  Before coming here, in my country. I was 14-year-old... We flirted like kids...  Her father didn't want her to meet me.  My family was not very respectable.
What do you do, with the money you earn?
Why did you unleash the pipe, I don't know?
...Yes?
Don't fear.
Because you have to pay.  It's like a parking meter: if you stay, you pay. It's the rule...
But... He works for your same employer?
...Who sent you?
Do you recognize him?
Listen, son, you know as well as me this kind of hitmen: they come from nowhere, get the contract and disappear. They're lonely, worse than wolves.
He probably just went somewhere.
This smells good.
Here comes the resume.
What if you don't make it?
Then it'll have to wait until I finish.
Mine.
So what's the deal Maurice?
I mean why the sudden voluntary visit  -- usually it takes gun- point to get you in here...
Yes -- you are.
I've seen it before.
You're feeling old and you want to start exercising.  A lot of men your age feel the need to recapture their youth.  Don't feel embarrassed about it.
You should start slow and easy -- fifteen minutes a day.
Yes?
A Book Society Award is a very prestigious thing.
There's no reason.
I want children.
It must've hit the window... I think its neck is broken.
That's okay -- really it is.
Doubts?  About what?
Red flags man.
Well, hello.
You know what... I'm just little now, but I'll be big soon.
Perhaps there's another route?
This story is big huh?
Michelle, breathe... that's it, what is it, talk to me.
It has to be a full character's name.
Where?
The hairs on my arm are standing up... Something strange is happening.
Are they standing?
She knows you love her Mr. Parker. She knows now.
Is it a boy or a girl?
I don't have kids.
How are you feeling?
There's a one-drink minimum per show, I hope you saw the sign when you came in. Anyway, they're supposed to tell you.
Non-alcoholic malt beverage?
Water?
That is, if you'll come to my room for an hour, I will give you five hundred dollars.
Sarah -- with an H?
Umm. We can stay in the car for an hour if you want. But I really have to go then. It's your time.
I guess I do too.
Do you want to fuck now?
No, I came here to drink... myself... you know...
I cashed in all of my money, paid my AmEx card, gonna sell the car tomorrow.
I'm rambling. I really like you. You make me want to talk... I don't know what time it is.
Yes.
It wasn't so important to me. I mean, he never asked me why I was a hooker, and that was impressive. I really liked him. So I decided to just play my part. I mean... it's good to help someone once in a while, it's a bonus to being alive, and that was my plan... to stay alive. I suddenly came to a decision.
You can never... never... ask me to stop drinking. Do you understand?
Hi!
Ben?
No. I think you're talking about you. I'll tell you right now that I'm in love with you... but, be that as it may, I'm not here to force my twisted life into your soul.
Ah, yes... I suppose sooner or later we ought to fuck.
Right... the suitcase was clinking. So what did you do with your clothes?
I am planning to go out and do some work.
Here's my speech...  ...I know this shouldn't be acceptable to me, but it is. Don't ask me why. I sense that your trouble is very big... and I'm scared for you... and so I'm doing what I think you need me to do. Falling down in casinos is little stuff. It doesn't bother me. It has nothing to do with us.
Years ago, in LA, I turned a trick on Sunset and Western. The guy was polite and didn't argue about the price. He parked his car and I took him to a house that I had an arrangement with. A fat Mexican woman was watching a TV and I told him to give her the twenty for the room. There were three or four small naked children playing on the floor and we had to step over them to get into the room. The room had a bed and a dresser. He lay on his back on the bed and I put a rubber on him and sucked him for a while until he was hard and then I eased on to him. About twenty minutes later there was a knock on the door and it was the woman saying our time was up. I felt kind of guilty because he hadn't come and I offered to reason with the woman and get another ten minutes, but he said it was all right and began dressing. When we were ready to leave the room he stopped me and... hugged me and kissed me on the cheek. He gave me an extra hundred as a tip and went back to his car. I remember being relieved that I wouldn't have to work again that evening.
Where was that house? The one in LA, I mean.
About ready for another drink?
You have been lonely?
I'm pleased with you, Sera... how you have moved up in the world. I showed you a glamorous world when I took you off the streets...  and how you repay me.
It is, after all, Sera, my money.
Yes? What?
Well, then. You'll need excellent recommendations from your professors, a heck of an admissions essay and at least a one-seventy-five on your LSATs.
Why would I kill my husband?
But is he an ass that's gonna win my case?
I'm a Delta Gamma and I'm a huge fan of yours!
No!
I got out of the shower, walked downstairs, saw her standing over my father, and called the police.
No.
Okay -- Ms. Windham, when you uh arrived back at the house? Was your father there?
Did you hear a shot fired?
But you didn't hear the shot, because you were in the shower.
Miss Windham, can you tell us what you'd been doing earlier in the day?
Come again?
Huh?
Sit down.
You're not going up there.
I do. I'm not allowing it.
What's going on?
Why didn't you call me?
We spend a beautiful night together and then I never hear from you again?
Yes?
-- his life?
After you went to all that trouble?
You ready?
God, that felt great!
You can't go home!
The idiot speaks.
Did you know he got wait-listed when he applied? His father had to make a call.
Here. You're gonna need this.
It's Elle!  Guess what I'm doing right this second?
Don't ask.
Okay, if Brooke didn't kill the guy, who did?
You're kind of being a butt-head right now.
Damn. We can't see her for an hour?
How can you still believe she's innocent?
The what?
Wait -- Hilary Clinton.
In that case, maybe Heyworth got fellated by a brunette and Brooke caught him.
Almost.
I miss you guys! The people here are so vile! Hardly anyone even talks to me unless it's to say something that's not nice. Law school sucks!
What're you doing here?!
You guys -- I can't. We're in the middle of a trial.
Neither.
Yes? Ms. Woods?
Amazing how?
You don't really believe she's innocent?
You're beautiful.
Of course.
Good. Good.
That's because I spend all my time with case studies and hypos.
If you tell him, you'll probably make summer associate. Who cares about Brooke? Think about yourself.
Pink ones.
Where?
She's naked.
So, I hear the tart from California shot Heyworth.
What's the thing that always makes us feel better, no matter what?
You passed Spanish because you gave Professor Montoya a hand-job after the final.
Fool's magic.
We come watch... we come watch...
More fun win battle?
I speak of love, and you think only of the lash.
On the contrary!  The puling, pallid creature you were before was truly something disgusting.  Now you are splendid... a fierce goddess... the embodiment of all that is strong and beautiful.
God protect me.
Like some vile toadstool.
Jack... Oh, Jack... Help me...
What was that?  Did you hear that?
It sounded like it came from the courtyard.
Might we watch, too?
You come stealee tleasoo?
No need lie, boy.  I no hurt you. Do I look like I wanna hurt you?
Course not.  I no flum here.  I come flum Cathay.
You come stealee tleasoo?
Well, bygones're bygones, I always say.
Twas Jimmy done that, I merely stood for the blame unfairly... but, here now, Ogg, this be no time to rehash old differences, I've friends along in need of safe haven for the night.
It's bluebells!
You have me word, lad.  To answer a faerie riddle deserves as much.
Are ye afraid of me wine?  Did your momma tell ye never to take food nor drink from the Wee Folk?  Think if ye sup with the faeries you'll be enchanted?
But... but, why?
Why has this happened to the world? Why is it winter now, and dark?
That much magic I can offer ye, a small measure of entertainment at best.  Making the world a frozen hell is beyond me modest powers.
Course we care.  What good's the world locked in a season of death. Frozen up, no folks to scare out of their wits on a summer's night; no babies to tickle; no more spells to cast... Think that's an enjoyable prospect?
Someone worthy of respect, lad.  She be a water spirit, lives in a bog down at sea-side.  Hideous creature to look at, even by my doubtful standards; devours little children, she does, when she can catch them.
Are we here?
So I'm to be a dragon-slayer, is that it?
Damn them!
Don't see why I can't ride, too! I'm second in command, damn it!
Beware.
Good.
And this?  Some of their handiwork?
I pray always to be worthy of it.
... this rate... we'll all be in our graves... 'fore we reach the Baron's fortress...
Why not admit it, Honeythorn Gump. We've lost our way entirely.
What magic have we on our side?
Because sunlight will kill him. Quickly now, give me the key.
I'm not afraid of the dark.
Seems to be some sort of vaulted chamber up ahead...
Ever wondered why Jenny Greenteeth said you needed the fastest steed on earth?
Ride like wild fire, Jack.
A good day for singing...
Where's your joy if you cannot sing?
The quest's at an end and where's the good of it?  A faerie festival over a pile of bones?
Nay.  It was lost.  When I came up for air the pond was frozen over.
Someone like Floki... or Squarefoot... or --
It's my father, gone a-hunting.  The Baron Couer de Noir is his guest and must be provided with some sport.
Let's rest a minute.  I'm so thirsty.
How much longer?
Such grace... and their smell; it's ambrosia.
I've no fear of failure.  Your implications are most unbecoming.
Damned hunters.  It was a trap, and you were the bait!
They tricked you.
How bad was the unicorn's wound?
There's no happier thought under heaven.
I have no wife.
It's the Baron's damnable work!  Too cowardly to stand and fight... he used you to save himself.
Oh!  Green Jack!  What a dream I've had... proper nightmare.
Honored to make your acquaintance.
Dear lad, what does winter bespeak but death?  It is a time of mourning.  This calamity is a curse. Something wondrous and beautiful has been taken from the world.
How do I get the horn back?
Where do I find the Baron's castle?
I don't believe you.
Courage, Jack.
Such a sad world, be there no unicorns to brighten it.
I had no thought of offending you, Oona.
In every way.
I would build a wall around me with such stone, so the likes of you might never enter.
Is this a May Day pageant?  Are you all off on a lark...?  The raven passed this way hours ago!
What can you steal from a man already lost his life?
Sorry, Jack.
Plenty treasure inside... Jimmy seen it once.
Marco!
Are you going to see Sam again?
Oh, honey.  There's not much to do there. I mean, it's all work.
And video games after!
Red.
Mom?
What are you doing up so early?
I'm going to bed.
Atonement.
It's not what I was expecting.
Hey.
Your dad dated my mom after her divorce.
Why are you so uptight?
It means I'm gonna shampoo my hair and stay out of your way.
Are you sure you're totally into guys?
Not really.
I thought I was helping you.
Are you guys' friends?
Oh, yes.
I assume you'll fill the...uh, window, with glass?
That would take weeks.
Peter Webber!  Right.  Quite the spotlight on that guy.
What are you talking about?  You love your job.
You'll have to explain that to the police.
I never said anything.  I haven't done anything.
I'll be around to check up on you.
Who are you, anyway?  I don't even know you.
You've worn out your welcome at this house, Sam.  I won't ever hit you.  This may well be the worst three months of your life, but you've earned it.  So, pick up your suitcase and go get in the truck.  Now.
Are you totally insane?!
I want you to take out your nose ring and leave it out.
I don't know.
Did you got through my pants?
Oh, so you're in the big shit now!  Child abuse.  People go to prison for what you just did to me.
What would you be doing now?
If I asked you to stop, would you?
I'm proud of you, Sam.
I still don't know what that means.
I don't wanna go, Sam.
What would you do?
Can you build a house in four months?
Good for you.
I aimed high.
Was bankrupt and dead before I was twenty.
Your kid was down around Diver's Cover again, smoking pot.  I didn't write him up...told him I wouldn't tell you...
God, you look like crap, George.
Because Dad left?
What are you doing?
You're inconsiderate and absolutely devoid of emotion!
I didn't think you'd know I went missing.
There's nothing anymore to stop me.
The garage.
I'll be by Saturday to pick him up.
Thank you for at least sounding sincere.
One of you would end up dead.
I did say he could go.
It makes me sad.
I don't even like turkey sandwiches. What kind of pizza?
Didn't you once dream you could lick people well, though?
You brought your kids?
You've never said that before.
It sounded like a pick-up line.
I could die.
I better get the kids home.
I wasn't sure.
He said he heard hammering.
What the fuck?
After the kids are back in school.
I was talking about our marriage.
Despite you.
Where are the kids?
You got a dog?
I've missed you guys.
The door was open.
Run downstairs and give your dad a hug.
Why do we have to get up and eat with you this early?
He's a big one.
You can try, but you won't get too far. Why you interested?
Maybe you didn't notice, but this is a prison.
Yo, Blocker, what's going on here?
Yeah, but what about me and Ray? I didn't see our names on that pardon. You said you were gonna put in a good word for us.
No, but...
She's alright, isn't she?
She always said that if you were on the outside...
For the kind of money they charge here, you'd think they could hire somebody to actually wash the dishes.
Did you go see my cousin Maynard like I asked you in my letter?
Yeah, that side of the family has all the looks and none of the brains. I hope he don't mess things up.
Sure I do. What's your name again?
Claude Banks. How could I forget that? You've got to remember me. Ray Gibson. We went to high school together.
The Negro League don't pay so good. And you're always on the road. That don't wash with Daisy.
Bank teller's just a start. I got plans. Real plans. Not opening some Zoom-Boom Room. This time next year I'll be a loan officer.
How would I get a loan, anyway?
Like this?
When there is, you can forget about it. And I swear to God, you ever talk about my daddy again I'm gonna kick your bank-telling, loan-denying ass, you got me?
You're soft.
Reward?
What can I say? When the spirit moves me.
This fork is filthy.
What a second, you've been in here since you were thirteen?
Sure is hot today. Think it'll rain later?
What do I want? What makes you think I want something?
Come on, man. Don't shut me out. I'm telling you, you and me, that map, we can go places.
No.
Come on, Ray, time to go!
Keep it together, Claude. You wake up the man, he'll shoot you for sure.
We'll just get off at the next stop.
Red Sox... Who's on the mound?
I know people.
What you're dealing with here is a complete lack of talent.
You want to hit?  Yo, Claude. Give Can't Get Right a shot.
You show them Crawfords how to play ball.
Crop duster.
My daddy died in prison. He gave up hope and hung himself. What you're talking about is the same damn thing. That ain't how I'm going.
I was sorry to hear about your mama passing.
I know, but since we're talking, I thought I'd mention it.
You and Wilkins sure are getting chummy. You two planning on going steady, or something?
This boat's gonna sail without you, too. I don't care if I last one day out here. At least it's one day of freedom. Now gimme those keys.
Why don't he just tell 'em the truth?
Over to the morgue and up the hill to the cemetery. Never thought I'd admit it, Claude, but you were right.
Soft and supple. Like a lady's.
You got your own nightclub?
We lost yesterday on accounta the rain. That means we gotta make up for it today, so put your backs to it.
Alright, listen up! I want every man lined up out here in the yard on the double! Let's move it!
So it don't exist.
Hey, the dude's holdin'.
That musta messed 'em up pretty bad.
What do you think about that?
Why do I get the feeling when you say some time, you mean some time.
Stay calm, Ray. We'll find him. Claude! Has anyone seen Claude?
You can't go in there, Ray! You'll never make it!
If you don't mind my saying, you seem mighty familiar with your house boy.
Respect? Well, isn't that progressive.
Is there any truth to what he's saying, Pike?
Yeah, it's special. They don't make 'em like this anymore.
That watch was the only thing my daddy ever gave me. It meant the world to me.
Hey, Ray, Goldmouth don't believe me. Ain't it so they got trains up in New York City that run under the streets?
Who?
That's it. The Boom-Boom Room. Sure would like to see that place when you get it up and running.
What's your name?
Man, that music is hot. What goes on down there, Slim?
If you fuck me on this one, I'll spare no expense.
I'll take the little choirboy, if you don't mind.
Welcome to the party. It's so nice to see all of you here.
Little Nicky.
Is this a joke?
You know, New Hell really only needs one new Satan.
Thank you, Nicky. Cause now I'm gonna bust Adrian's head wide open.
No!
The home of eternal damnation, house of Hades, H.E. double toothpicks...
Okay, can I just ask you something? What do you know about your mom?
Did you just talk?
Oh my God, he just opened his mouth and swallowed that spit.
My name's Beefy. I'm an old friend of your father's. He's asked me to help you out.
You're on Earth now, kid. Gonna have the same physical needs and limitations a human has. We'll stop by K-mart. Get you some warm clothes.
This is intense! And it happens every day? Sometimes twice? I gotta tip my hat to you people!
You can't do jack shit... unless you learn your evil powers.
I didn't murder anybody
No, no, that's not what I said. He can keep his thumbs, but the fingers gotta go.
Nothing, Dad. Just re-arranging the furniture.
This was a very difficult decision, because I have three wonderful sons. I mean, Adrian, so smart, so ruthless. And Cassius, so strong, so tough. And Nicky, so... so...
To do that Cassius and Adrian have to come back through the other way.
No. This can't be happening.
Thanks.
Bus?
Boogerland!
Hey...
I've never been to Earth. I've never even slept over at some other dude's house!
You were gone ten seconds. What happened?
I was in love one time but she said I wasn't financially reliable enough. And she needed that.
There's our man.
You sure you're down with this?
Which way did he go?
So I was driving to work today, and some bozo in a Cadillac cut me off...
So I followed him...
You gotta kill yourself.
It's "Comptoir Sud Pacific." Makes me feel like a hula girl. Which is kinda what I'm going for. Wanna come in?
Adrian?
You think I'm a tourist?
I don't know, but I like it. Say. Your glasses are nice. They make your eyes look sparkly and big. It's fun to look at them.
Could I come with you to getting a Gelati?
Want to? A million angry octopus people couldn't hold me back!
It's freezing my hands.
This town is really going to hell lately.  So what part of the city do you live in?
You know what's nice about you? You just seem happy being yourself. You don't try to act cool.
I think I'm floating.
Look, just because you're floating doesn't mean I'm gonna forget about you giving me the finger.
Where'd a sweet Southern boy learn to fight like that?
Yes. What is rent?
No.
You callin' me a thief, my man?
For me? Better feel sorry for yourself, Sandman!
That's better.  How do you want us?
All right. Now you keep your bargain.
I am.
Do you have anything special in mind?
You need a lift. Let's go to Arcade and celebrate...  your alert successor... Logan-6.
Did you ever see Francis-8?
Who invited you?
What the hell took you so long?
I think you've been skulling out too much. First Nursery and now stupid questions.
Where do you live, Mary?
When do you go up?
What Quad do you live in?
You could have called me yourself.
You can have any woman in the city. What do you really want?
Why tell me?
About running, dying what?
I don't..
What're you going to do?
I wish I could help you.
I'd rather be with you.
They're like beasts. Wild.
Just follow -- no matter how it seems...
The Cubs. When they're flying on muscle there's no way to catch up. Without the dazzle, they'd just go past us --  -- too fast
I -- I can't.
You're really one of us now, aren't you?
Do you think everything's going to turn to ice?
It all seemed to make sense until Box.
You're right... it must be near now. We'll find it.
They all have names and numbers on them. I wonder what they are?
There's a Sanctuary... there is!
There has to be! I know it exists! It has to!!
We can't. We're going back.
What kind of jewel is this?
I'll make the arrangements.
Goodbye.
Where are they?
We're leaving.
Thousands and thousands... as many as my cats?
Is that really it? It doesn't seem very far. Will we be there soon?
You're not contagious are you?
You're a musician?
Why not?
Why not?
How'd the camera get so high like that?
Like you'd get if it was hand held.
Might be a good time to try using it again.
We'll keep a watch on the house.
You don't remember being awakened? It looks like you were aware of someone.
You recognize that guy?
How would you like to take me to dinner?
Where's your phone? I have to call another taxi.
Sure.
He'll kill us.
What's he do?
How'd it happen, Alice?
That's his name... Andy. Our ticket out of here.
Are you kidding?... I've got so much on Andy, it isn't funny.
Are you my man?
You got him.
You all right?
Where's the bathroom?
Yeah.
What's up?
You don't look so good.
Where's Pete?
Did you ask him who he is?
If he's not Madison, then where's Madison?
How about Madison? Have we had even a hint of his whereabouts?
What's the matter?
We know that.
Who is it?
I examined Madison last night, Marshall. He had a headache.
What's your axe?
We've met before, haven't we?
At your house.
I called, you know.
Don't you want to watch it?
What was that?!!!
It was a long time ago... I met him at this place called Moke's... We... became friends... He told me about a job...
If you think you can finish it, I'll be back later today.
No. No, I don't.
What are you guys doin'?
Why haven't you called me?
What do you want?
Well, there's certainly nothing wrong with that meal!
Not even a radio?
Sorry.
Uh-huh.
I see.
Wait a minute. Is it a good morning? Say, we're supposed to be traveling east, aren't we?
Is it?
Uh-huh. You're a scream, Lovey.
How about you Lovey? Come on. Let's you and I play a game of honeymoon bridge.
I don't know why I associate with you, Mr. Barnard - or Mr. Chalmers Bryant - or Mr. Embezzler - or whatever your name may be.
Barney? Why should I? Never! We have nothing in common. Hmmpf, Barney! What effrontery!
It's better than freezing to death down below, isn't it?
That's what I say. What do you say to a rubber of bridge? I saw some cards in the other room.
Hey, hurry up, you slow-pokes - I'm starved!
You see? You get the idea? From this reservoir here I can pipe in the whole works. Oh, I'm going to get a great kick out of this. Of course it's just to keep my hand in, but with the equipment we have here, I can put a plumbing system in for the whole village down there. Can rig it up in no time.  Do you realize those poor people are still going to the well for water?
If you want me to!
Yes. I've just been talking with the porters. They're going to take us. We've got clothing, food, everything. Come on!
You mean you don't want to go?
All right! If you insist on being an idiot, I'm not going to waste time coaxing you.  How about you?
Where is your mad pilot?
And the wine - excellent.
Oh, yes.
You know, that's the fourth time you've said that today. You should have a record made of it.
By the way, what religion do you follow here?
To put it simply, I should say that our general belief was in moderation. We preach the virtue of avoiding excesses of every kind, even including  the excess of virtue itself.
Well, it must have taken
That would suit me perfectly. I'm always broke. How did you pay for them?
Well, they didn't actually mean that.
That's all very fine if it works out. A little amazing, of course.
One moment. You say the High Lama is the only one who can give us any information?
Your brother seems quite fascinated by her.
Leave Shangri-La! That's not likely. You couldn't drive her out.
You must prevail upon him not to attempt the journey. He could never get through that country alive.
What do you want?
Well, Mr. Chang, I thought, with your permission of course, and while I'm waiting for these porters, I would like to organize classes for those children in the valley and teach them something practical and something useful. Geology.
I'll die if I have to stay here another minute! I've waited a long time for this chance to go, and you're not going to stop me now. If I have to, I'll go alone. It was I who bribed the porters. If it weren't for me, you'd never get out!
He's dead? That's fine. You won't see me shedding any tears over him!  Oh George, you must take me with you!
Sit here, near me. I am an old man and can do no one any harm.
And be sure that none of the natives get in.
Just what I needed too.
Don't worry, George. Nothing's going to happen. I'll fall right into line. I'll be the good little boy that everybody wants me to be. I'll be the best little Foreign Secretary we ever had, just because I haven't the nerve to be anything else.
Oh George, come on.
What is it? Has he fainted?
Yes.
What's it mean?
I don't know.
Don't you ever want to see what's on the other side of the hill?
Did I say "if"?
Well - I mean
Uh-huh.
Well, we haven't been murdered in our beds yet, George, have we?
For heaven's sake, Bob, what's the matter with you? You went out there for the purpose of
What else could it mean to me? It's obviously a lot of bunk.
Look here, Bob, Ever since I can remember, you've looked after me. Now I think you're the one that needs looking after. I'm your brother, Bob. If there's something wrong with you, let me help you.
Besides, I - I don't feel like making that trip alone, Bob.
George, are you sure of the porters? About their taking care of you, I mean?
This would be funny - if it wasn't so pathetic. Why, she isn't a day over twenty!
What about the others?
Lucky thing for me you snapped out of it, too. You saved my life. I never could have made it alone.
Where did you come from?
Good.
We'll smash his face in. That's what we'll do.
I'm thirty.
I'm sorry. I thought I was to be the light. But why do I confuse you? Am I so strange?
I'm sure of it. Just as I'm sure there's a wish for Shangri-La in everyone's heart. I have never seen the outside world. But I understand there are millions and millions of people who are supposed to be mean and greedy. Yet I just know that secretly they are all hoping to find a garden spot where there is peace and security, where there's beauty and comfort, where they wouldn't have to be mean and greedy. Oh, I just wish the whole world might come to this valley.
Oh, the usual reasons. A world full of people struggling for existence.
Would you like to wring my little neck?
Now that dinner is over, if you'll excuse us, we're very anxious to discuss ways and means of getting back home.
EXCUSE ME
You promised to come for tea yesterday. I waited for so long.
I'll make some for you!  You will come today?
Please say you will. The days are so very long and lonely without you.  Please . . .
Kids' game a couple galaxies over.
They don't?
So... wait.  You just asked... but he goes so fast, he actually brought what you asked for before you asked for it.
It'll make sense later?
Cowan.  Do you ever think that maybe, just maybe, other people might be right and you might be wrong?
Which do you have your money on, Dee?
Kay, listen, I dunno what got into--
'Hell, I may as well do something useful.
Vayanse. You others, go on.
This is a neurelyser. it was a gift from some friends from out of town. I need you to look at it.  This red eye here isolates and measures the nature of the electronic impulses currently in your brain.  More specifically, the ones -for memory, which it will then block.   I said I need you to look right here.
The point is to not call attention to ourselves.
I know, but we're on a college campus...
I think she's the alien.  In any case, she's clearly spent my too much time alone in this room.
I'm just saying it was cold.  I think she kind of liked me.
I know, that's usually the only time I actually have a shot.  And what if I wanted to see her again?  I'd have to completely re-introduce myself.
Hey, I was workin' her.  I was workin' my thing.
He's a slimy little slithering scumwad is what he is.
Ernie Goose?  Cynthia?
How does that help me?
I know what you're saying.  And I'm telling you I don't trust him--
You were saying?
I'm just wondering what's so great out there that everyone's trying to get to it?
Yeah.  His dream and our worst nightmare.
Exactly.  I very much enjoy that.
I don't think so.   I mean, him, he could be a scientist, maybe.  But you...  Exterminator, I'd understand.  But entopolgist?  No way.
Is it my eyes... or is that thing a little...
Goodwill...
Hmnn... wall, it's funny, cause usually I'm not all that attracted to stupid guys, but--
They're gone.
I'm getting a trajectory...
As far as I can tell, the guy's what he says he is - alone, and unarmed.  All he wants is five minutes to introduce himself to the public.
Yeah?  What's up?
And get this: you know how humans evolved from primates?  Well guess what the dominant life form on planet evolved from?
Now, what are we looking at?  Keys.  Look at them all.  Why do we have them?  Mr. President?
Why, you might ask?  Because you're ready.  Because you've finally gone as far as you can go without it.
What?
What?
Agatha --
Drop some money.
No.  Follow him.
Please, I want to go back...
She grew up.
Just some guy... they found.
About who?
I'm so sorry... I just want him back... I want him back so bad...
You do understand I can't just give you new irises.  The scanners will read the scar tissue.  Alarms will go off.  Large men with guns will appear...
You made those tapes...
You set your patients on fire!
I don't ever see any of you precops down here, I'm not in trouble am I?
Why's he still a John Doe?  Why wasn't he ever ID's from an EYEscan?
Hey, you wanna know where the word came from, "glitch?"
Has the observer from Justice shown up yet?
You can let him look around, answer his questions, but watch him.  If there's any problems, make sure we know about it first.
Lara called me.
You understand, John, that the minute Precrime goes national, they're going to take it away from us.
This is all Witwer.  He's setting me up.
I'm out of breath!  I'm a fucking fugitive!
Can you fake the cerebral output?
You can't run --
John --
Seventeen minutes.
Uh, sir...
The victim's name is Leo Crow.
Uh, yeah, you mind getting me a piece of that cake they're eating down there?  I'm starving.
So I'll be the first one to go in then?
Sorry.  Old habit.  I spent three years at Fuller Seminary before I became a cop.  My father was a minister.  Lutheran.
She was looking right at me.
What happened?  Where's the rest?
Okay... now let me time you.
Come on!
You're alive?
I was looking for you...
Look, I've put my family through enough misery.  You gotta kill me! This way I can leave 'em something.
Look, believe me, I know it's hard, but you gotta do it --
Tell me, who was it, set this up?
You have three minutes to tell me what you're doing here before I feed you to a few of my more predacious plants.
You don't seem all that proud.
You're talking about the precogs...
-- and then walk out.
John?
Lamar, do you know the reason why John came here to work with you?
All right.  Tell you what I'll do. First thing Monday, I'll look over the Witwer evidence and I'll have Gideon run the Containment files, see if anyone drowned a woman named -- what did you say her name was?
How did you get this?
Good God.  What was that?
Near Death's real popular right now, which includes everything from getting hit by a car, to falling off a high building to plane crashes.  It's a big rush, you come out the other side without a heart attack.
This is Evanna, the team pilot.
Can't they shut that off?
There a maid in this hotel?
If you were a child killer, you took these pictures, would you leave them out on the bed for anyone to find?
What kind of cop were you before this?
Why don't I feel like celebrating?
Raincheck?
My name is Danny Witwer.  I'm --
I don't have any sugar either.
That was our apartment.
You said in your divorce papers that he tried to kill himself.
What was it then?
He took out his gun and sat down to watch his home movies.  This is all in your statement, Lara...
Lamar Burgess thinks that you left John because he lost himself in Precrime instead of you.
Nice to meet you, Wally.
Wally, the other two can still function, right?
Now, Mr. Slade, you're in room 315.
Thank you very much, sir.
Honestly, the suites are all about the same.
As far as...?
So, wait, you're from where?
I don't get it. What do you do?
Should I fuck him?
You think he don't know? I give him his cut of seventeen hundred, I think he knows I can't make that lap dancing.
Honey?
Oh, please.
Bullshit. These are classy customers. You can't show up all fucked up with a Fila running suit on.
Well, that's not gonna happen.
Go finish getting ready. I'll take care of dinner.
Maxie's fucking with me. He put you with the spook to get under my skin.
I want you to quit.
Max offered to stake me.
Don't you get it? I don't want to leave. This is who I am.
Take her.
Well, you look it. You win?
Yeah.
How bad is it?
When's it going down?
Why isn't Ruiz coming?
He must have that shit troughed.
It sounds to me like everybody's just a little jumpy. And since all it is is a drop, the Welshman's got nothing at stake. I say we go to his 'troughed off' bar. It'll calm his nerves, we drop the bag, and we all get back to our lives.
Where we going?
How so?
You bet the ponies?
Smart. Hard as hell to handicap. You know what I like? Hai Alai. Fast game. You know why I like it?
I got a way we make everybody happy.
Ruiz wants to go alone, but it's not up to Ruiz. It's up to me, and I like a sure thing. Just go and we're square on the tooth.
Ricky? Ricky 'I lost the truck' Ricky?
I gotta tell you, Mr. Reuben, I'm not comfortable getting in any deeper. It's one thing to look after Jess...
Yes.
That's him. Now you all know the drill, right?
What's the plan?
Now listen. The gig couldn't be simpler. You carry the money to the Welshman, he checks it, hands you his marker, you're done. The washed money goes directly to Maxie. Long as you hand off the bag, you're tight.
Nah.
No. Just the cross streets.
This Ruiz guy, what's his deal?
We're with Ruiz.
So, it's not a winning record.
Of course I don't want you to bring it up to him... But if it comes up...
Damn right, I have. You think I like living on fucking Yucca? We do a good job on this, we're in.
Please. I got three inches on you. You wouldn't have landed a punch if I didn't let you.
Maxie says he runs a tight ship. I wouldn't fuck with him.
Who you calling?
Great. On my fucking room.
They didn't say an address?
Nothing else.
You just don't fucking get it, do you?
Yeah. What vibe?
Yeah.
You can't go in there. They know you're with Ruiz.
Look who's back? Want some champagne?
What the fuck's going on?
He said it's being arranged. He said Jimmy will know.
Nothing, man.
You wanna see how fast I get a gun?
I'm sorry...
Let's get some sleep. That's what we need, man. Sleep.
Three and a half hours?
You want to come splash around.
You look good, man.
Yes?
Yes.
Where's Spa.
What the fuck, 'Red Dragon?'
See you later.
Dude, you just gotta settle your shit down. You gotta go and say all that 'Red Dragon' shit. Make him think he's on Barretta.
Well, I didn't care for the club much. And, I must say, I didn't care for him either.
Sure. Anyplace in particular?
Here they are, then.
Brilliantly. Care for a pint?
So you're our own private guy?
A lot of Persians?
Sure. You boys want anything?
I get it.
You want... Why are you picking on me?
Yeah. That fernet tastes like tar. My grandfather tried to give me that.
We don't know any drill. Nobody told us anything.
Who's gonna outfit us?
The Red Dragon.
Well, that's news to me. The name's Tom.
Scotland.
I'm working trains. Selling.
Is your papa West Indian?
Did you just now con me?
Daddy, where's my money?
1, 2, 8 hit, didn't it?
Oh, sit down, man. What you tasting? I'm buying.
I'm wearing, Archie.
Let Billie finish.
Can you use a few bucks? I ain't got much, but --
Take it easy. Lay down and don't think about it.
Why? Why does everybody conk?
Sure, burn yourself, pain yourself, put all that poison into your hair, into your body -- trying to be white.
I read. I study. Because the first thing a black man has to do is respect himself. Respect his body and his mind. Quit taking the white man's poison into your body: his cigarettes, his dope, his liquor, his white woman, his pork.
Little.
Allah has sent us a prophet, a black man named Elijah Muhammad. For if God is black, Malcolm --
The body is a holy repository.
I can't.
I want to, Bembry, but I can't.
Yeah. When I was picking a lock to rob somebody's house.
Brother Bembry, can we fix it so our loudspeaker is heard on the street?
Do you?
I'll have it tomorrow.
What?
I see your point.
Could we sit down someplace?
But Brother Bembry says I'm tall enough for a tall man.
I don't want to bring my troubles home. You know that.
I just want to sit here and be still.
"Both women, in their 20's, charged they had had intimacies with Elijah Muhammad since 1957..."
Dear heart, you have to help me. I'm raising our kids practically by myself, while you're running all over the world. You don't know how many times the girls ask me when is daddy coming home?
Stop calling us. Leave us alone. Leave us alone. I'll kill you. I'll kill you.
Brother Earl.
I called Sister Betty, she didn't tell you?
I assumed...
Brother Minister, what is wrong?
Why don't you just ask your question?
What color were the original Hebrews?
Mr. X is a demagogue. He has no place to go, so he exaggerates. He's a disservice to every good law-abiding Negro in the country. Can I ask you a question?
Mr. Malcolm X, why do you teach black supremacy? Why do you teach hate?
Stop me if I'm wrong. I "polarize the community." I "erroneously appraise the racial picture."
Are you Elijah's pimp?
Fourteen counts of 8 to 10 years.
'Lo. I've got to freshen up.
Baby, I'll call you tomorrow.
I think sometimes, Mrs. Little, candor is the only kindness.
All day since you and Betty left. Brother Minister, I have to level with you. They gave me a mission. But I couldn't do it. I love y'all.
To wire your car so it would explode when you turned the ignition. The Ministers say you are spreading untruths about the Messenger. The Ministers say you are a great hypocrite, Judas, Benedict Arnold. The Ministers say your tongue should be cut out and delivered to the Messenger's doorstep.
You like 'em scrambled soft or hard, sweetie?
You the man.
You evil this morning.
Baby, I was gonna give it to you.
Except she live on the hill and got a grandma.
I forgot to tell you I'm wearing a bulletproof vest.
Yeah and get a slave, too, huh, baby?
I'm Minister Malcolm X. Two witnesses saw him brought in. He was not brought out.
I didn't know then that I was a nigger.
What am I doing here?
You have a rather checkered past. Mr. Creasy. Your Interpol file is six pages long.
My family lives in Miami. Because of the death threats.
Where do I find you?
Another favor... get me banking info on Jordan Kalfus. U.S. deposits or withdrawals. Thanks. Oh, get me the same on Samuel Ramos.
[Reina Rosas.]
[Daniel.]
[Daniel Rosas Sanchez.]
[What's the PIN number?]
[Who's the boss?]
[What money?]
[Do you ever see the hand of God in what you do?]
[Do you know who I am?]
Who's he?
[And I had my men ready.]
[Who gave the bags to Ramos?]
You got a secondary search and you had a gun.
Yeah, right...
Your Spanish is good enough. You certainly look the part.
No.
Are you going to quit? My last bodyguard quit.
Pinta, do you have a pencil?
Do you think he'll come back?
How's the ankle? Can you put your weight on it?
Well, it's a sort of wife.
In the West, it's one wife for one husband, but different cultures have different rules.
I'm not afraid you, Creasy.
I know because I go in your room and check the bottles.
Then be trained.
Be a swimmer.
It makes it all seem so serious.
Sorry.
Jordan!
They planned it, Samuel and Kalfus.
I don't believe you.
Where are you?
Of course I care about Pinta. She'll be as beautiful as her mother one day.
[OK, repeat the drop instructions.]
She likes him.
Pollo Pibil. Chicken and chorizo sausage. Hmmmh. They marinate it in lemon and orange juice. It's a stew really.
I read the file. You and Creasy have been seen quite a bit together.
You helped him get this job.
Yes. But if I traced Creasy to you, others will do it as well. Their facilities are as good as my own, if not better.
Light. At the end of a long, dark tunnel. Somehow, she showed him it was alright to live again.
Millie's been after me to fix her up with a date, so I...
You wanna have a drink before we start dancing?
That big girl that was sitting in front of us with the skinny friend.
Well, let's call her up. What can we lose?
Well, what do you feel like doing tonight?
So what do you feel like doing tonight?
Not a bad crowd tonight, you know?
Where you been, for Pete sakes?! I been looking all over for you.
You want me to ride down with you?
It's Saturday night! There's still plenty-a action around!
Who you gonna call?
I wake up this morning, I hear the baby crying. So I wake up. I come in their room. That girl is shaking her hand atta baby. I said, "You brute! Don't you strike that baby! That's my son's baby!"
Did I tell you she threw the bottle- a milk at me?
Ufa!
My son Thomas came to see you this afternoon, and he said to you he wants to cast his mother from his house?
So I am an old garbage bag, put inna street.
It pains that they should do this.
Oh sure.  This girl is a college graduate.
I cry a lot too. I'm a big cryer.
I'm twenty-nine years old. How old are you?
...When I got outta the army, Clara, I was lost. I didn't know what I wanted to do. I was twenny-five years old, what was I gonna do, go back to my old job, forty cents an hour. I thought maybe I go to college under the G.I. Biller Rights, you know? But I wouldn't graduate till I was twenny-eight, twenny-nine years old, even if I made it in three years. And my brother Freddie wanted to get married, and I had three unmarried sisters -- in an Italian home, that's a terrible thing. And my kid brother Nickie, he's a one got married last week. So I just went to pieces. I used to walk inna streets till three, four o'clock inna mornings. My mother used to be so worried about me. My uncle Mario come over one time. He offered me a job driving his hack onna night shift. He got his own cab, you know. And God forgive me for what I'm gonna say now, but I used to thinka doing away with myself. I used to stand sometimes in the subway, and God forgive me what I'm going to say, I used to feel the tracks sucking me down under the wheels.
...It's really a fine opportunity for me. But I'm not sure I want to be a department head. It's mostly executive and administrative work. Well, anyway, I told you about my father, and he depends on me a great deal, and...
I think you're kidding yourself, Clara. I used to think about moving out, you know? And that's what I used to say. "My mother needs me." But when you really get down to it, that ain't it at all. Actually, you need your father. You know what I mean? You're living at home, and you got your father and mother there, and you can go on like that -- being a little girl all your life.
This is the kitchen.
No...
I'll call you up tomorrow morning. Maybe, we'll go see a movie.
The reason I can't be definite about it now is my Aunt Catherine is probably coming over tomorrow, and I may have to help out.
It was very nice meeting you, Mrs. Pilletti. I hope I'll see you again.
I'm just gonna get my cigarettes. I left them in my coat.
I always figure a guy oughta marry a girl who's twenny years younger than he is so that when he's forty, his wife is a real nice-looking doll.
All right, I'll see you, Thomas, because he wants an answer by Monday.
Tommy, gimme a coupla minutes, because I promised Mr. Gazzara I'd let him know tomorrow. See, what I wanna know, Tom, if a buncha individual retail merchants get together, how does it operate? On individual mark- ups? You know what I mean? Say I'm the butcher and Aldo Capelli, he's the dairyman and grocer, so suppose I mark up thirty-five percent, but he works on forty, so...
Well, I understand the problem about the supermarkets, but I was talking to this girl last night, and she made the point that a likeable personality is a valuable business asset.
Hello, Marty, when you coming home? Where you now? Because your cousin Thomas and his wife Virginia, they're here. They had another fight with your Aunt Catherine... I don't know...
Ha! Who told you about the Stardust Ballroom?
Sooner or later, there comes a point in a man's life when he gotta face some facts, and one fact I gotta face is that whatever it is that women like, I ain't got it. I chased enough girls in my life. I went to enough dances. I got hurt enough. I don't wanna get hurt no more. I just called a girl just now, and I got a real brush-off, boy. I figured I was past the point of being hurt, but that hurt. Some stupid woman who I didn't even wanna call up. She gave me the brush. I don't wanna go to the Stardust Ballroom because all that ever happened to me there was girls made me feel like I was a bug. I got feelings, you know. I had enough pain. No, thank you.
What are you talking about? She's a nice girl.
I don't like her.
I don't know! She don't look like Italian to me. Plenny a nice Italian girls around.
So, Marty, lemme tell you about these nurses, Marty...
Hello, Ralph.
Hello, Aunt Theresa.
Ma, you want something to eat, some tuna fish?
Hello, Aunt Theresa.
No, Virginia, I know how you feel.
Marty, I don't know how to tell you how much I appreciate what you and your mother are doing, because the kinda thing was happening in our house was Virginia was in the kitchen making some milk for the baby. So my mother comes in...
Don't you think I feel lousy about this too?
Once a month you couldn't let her use the kitchen!
Y'all were short a couple cutters and we're what the Army sent.
Reckon so, but we been boozing all day and you work up an appetite.
Yeah, maybe move that nurse in. She don't seem the type to keep you awake praying.
I mean, what were you doing? Were you a resident or on a staff someplace?
Epidural hematoma?
You  must  open  me  up  again?
So long, Ho-Jon.
Little light reading matter. Just right for his age.
What's that?
Best equipped dentist in the whole goddam Army. Care to have a look, a man with your background?
Never mind. Forget it.
I thought we were heading for trouble putting on all these trinkets.
Godless buffoons, all of them.
Oh, I'm used to it. What makes me sore is how they behave towards you.  They ought to be grateful to have you.  I certainly am.
...And for our young men on the field of battle, that they may return home to their dear ones...
I was just asking...
You mean Hot Lips? Screw her.
You betcher ass, Dad.
And there it is.
Well, it's still pretty much in the talk stage.
B-E-R-T, right. See you tomorrow.
I'm not so sure the goddam thing's in his heart.
Did I ever tell you about Me Lay Marston?
Please!  Face it, Colonel, you don't have us, we have you. Your boys blew this case, we bailed you out. We figure we ought to hang around a day to check the Congressman's kid, and we also figure to play some golf. So if that's okay with you, we got a deal.
It's in pretty deep.
Captain, I've been observing the nurses on your shift. But naturally your own opinion is more informed than mine.
That kind of familiarity is inconsistent with maximum efficiency in a military organization.
If you start the game instead of waiting, you mean?
Our minds?
You're an attractive man.
But I'm married.
You'd think now, with only six weeks before they ship me back home, it would be easier. But it isn't.
In less than twelve hours I'll be on my way.
Captain Camembert! Captain Camembert!
Yes, Reverend?
What's wrong with him?
He's coming to.
But I had this feeling I ought to make the effort. To test myself. And I flunked.
Now I know that's been my problem since I was a kid. But it only caught up to me last night.
But it's all over now, and I can't face it. Imagine if you found out you were one, you wouldn't like breaking the news to your wife. Well, I got the same problem multiplied.
Good morning, Captain Pierce and Captain Forrest.
Officer all sleep now, yes? And I go wash clothes.
You work those kind of hours, you got to have rest. Which you can't get with somebody jabbering away on a direct line to heaven.
We got it, men... Ho-Jon's keep as Androscoggin... if there is such a place. And the big news is, the General wants a rematch.
To Major Burns' tent. Yes, sir.
Those two big guys were tackles on the Cleveland Browns, and the redhead played halfback with the Rams.
Well, there's one big satisfaction.
What's the bastard really like?
Huh?
Here. Sit down!  Quiet, egghead!  All right, now, a serious expression.
Against anything. Just protest.
Yes!
Hello, John.
Well, yes, I was. But I was your father then, see?  But the real me, John Doe, er, that is, Long John Willoughby, I was the fellow up there with the book. You know what I mean?
How many people do you think we've talked to already, outside the radio, I mean?
Money?  Well, I'm glad to hear somebody admit it. Do you suppose you could write a radio speech that would put that fellow over?
Thank you very much for everything.
Oh! Oh, it's beautiful, D. B. WellI don't quite know what to say . . .
Hello there. Well, well! If it isn't the man about town!
That's good.
Oh.
The Websters!
What?
Yeh, D. B. Oh, just cleaning out the dead-wood. Okay.
I'll tell you what I'll do. I get thirty dollars a week. I'll take twenty-five, twenty if necessary. I'll do anything you say.
The whole town's in an uproar. We've got to find him. The letter's our only clue.
Say that again.
So you think this is worth a thousand dollars, do you?
Hurry up, Pop.
Well, maybe you're right.
Okay, fellows.
Well, nobody asked yuh.
Where's Connell?
Hey, do you know something? She supports a mother and two kids. What do you know about that?
Yeah, Boss?
Hey, Boss.
Who's got him?
Holy smoke! A half a heelot!
How could he be a fake? 
Sure, you are.
I gotta figure some way out of this thing!
Join the John Doe Club.
I trust him.
Yeah, but it's got to be by Bone- Setter Brown.
Run a story. Say John Doe was in here, and is sorry he wrote the letter and
Flowers.
Racket? What do you mean?
Y-yeah. Gee, doggone it, I never thought about that. Gosh!
Say, who's putting up this dough?
Now, look. I'll give this money to the Colonel just as soon as you get started. We'll have a car waiting at the side entrance for you.
I don't know.
Not that we know of.
Dinner's on you.
Speaking of which. I saw you talking to Ronnie this morning. Why can't you get it back together with her. You've gotta be out of your mind not to get with that one.
What's the line?
Who is it?
Duke Ellington. "Things Ain't What They Used To Be", recorded July 30, 1945.
You fucking idiot! Why do you think I use you?... To be a walking advertisement.
Not the fucking cop that showed up at my door!
Don't make do it, Mike.
I... I'm Kevin. I 'm here to help you, D... Dave.
Who's controlling your mind?
This has nothing to do with Walter.
Where's the car?
Who are you again?
We got a guy who's probably on drugs. He's got a record of 459's and he was busted on possession. But he's never been busted on a major felony. What's his demeanor?
Anything on Korda so far?
What do you got on Korda?
Did you check out DMV for any vehicles registration?
How do you feel after a shooting.
It rarely has to be done.
What's the point of this?
Yeah, I've got a girlfriend.
She's going to come here when she graduates and then we're gonna get married.
That's a lot of commitment. I admire that.
You could say something like,  "Tell me what the scumbag's name is. Maybe we can work something out."
Get good at it.
I bought you a four-six exacta box. You owe me twenty bucks.
Ronnie... Yeah, so.
I'm just practicing my lying.
The 6 horse is last.
The 6 horse is still last.
We won!
Is it always like this?
It might have happened no matter who was up there.
Have you evacuated anyone?
Ray, if you walk out of here with me, I'll get you a job.
Maybe you should be.
What are you talking about? This is it. This is the stuff right here.  Well, maybe just a pinch more sugar.
What about Greg? What are you gonna tell him?
When?
There is?
Korda escaped.
Scottie?
Scott...
...the hell are you talking about?
The hell I am!
Tell him to give me a raise.
Are you going to make this hard for me?
There's been some concern about you continuing to work without back-up.
What if you die and no one can do what you do as well as you do it?
Is there going to be an expression of your appreciation?
And a car.
You know you've got nothing but cars down there in impound.
The car is part of the deal.
This is Halden.
Why?
Why --
As long as it's not 'what's your sign?'
This is how you pick up women --
Your life that bad?
Who are you?!
The guests are here.
What's happening?
You are not a God.
Have communications contact all interface centers.  Tell them due to high demand, we're at full capacity and so temporarily there's no room for anyone else on the system.
Where you plugged-in from?
We can be there in fifteen minutes and rip him off the system.
Try harder.
One condition.
Christoph was in charge of designing building modules.
Who did he digitize?
We drugged her.  So she wouldn't remember.
There was no need to kill her.
What brings you inside?
I'm sorry sir, we need your debit card before we can issue a credit --
I wasn't with you.
Don't know what you're talking about.
Why not?
My uni-net account.  I log on.  The program's there.
Voice activate.
Waiter, busboy, Maitre-De --
We've got him locked!
He's on us!!
Alpha.  Is there any way we can defeat this  monster?  Any way at all?
Is this... food!
He wants to know if you'd like a cube of sugar in your tea.
I heard that!
I can hardly walk...
To assist you I have retro-fitted your helmets with new Opti-Scan devices.
Alpha, my sensors tell me the Rangers were too late!  Ivan is on his way here!
By bouncing ultra-high frequencies off one of the network satellites, I can send a long-range pulsar signal to within TWO FEET of the Rangers coordinates.
Ay, yi, yi!  The Rangers are going to be CRUSHED!
You okay?
I am the wolf, cunning and swift!
NINJA CRANE ZORD!
The Stealth Eagle is about to fly.
Uh... that's classified, top secret, confidential, undercover information.
SKULL!!
GET OFF ME!
But boss, what about their parents?
That's right.  And then we threw one of them off a mountain and another one into a raqing river!
Anybody see them?
THREE SECONDS!!
There seems to be some confusion about your registration. I believe I can find you a place at the Ambassador. Many persons of the Jewish faith find it quite...
What you're sayin' makes a lotta sense. Ya know, if I keep on killin' people like I have, I won't have no more friends left!
Torrio ain't like them guys. He thinks like an American. You'd like him, Charlie. He'd like you.
You ever been near a meat packing plant? My father makes a couple million per, but the smell in his office is enough to make you puke.
Up down. Down up. It's the same. You see things through both eyes.
Four-twenty-eight.
But Maranzano's got the men and the brains.
Masseria's confused. He can't figure whether you're workin' for Maranzano, or gettin' ready to kill the bastard. So he's spreadin' the word that you're goin' after Profaci because it happened on his turf. I figure Masseria's gonna try to rub out Profaci, and pin it on us. Then Maranzano will have to kill ya.
Where'd ya get this funny ravioli?
The deal's too good, Frankie
What's the matter?
Come on. It's Christmas. At least stay for breakfast.
Something came up.
I booked passage to London.
If I look weak now, it's over.
A lot of shit came out of me in the hospital. I'm sorry you got hit by it.
Who'll make the rules?
Bugsy, you and I don't need to be in business with Maranzano. We got more jobs than we can handle. That's not the problem.
I been thinkin'...
Like Don Maranzano.
Your honeymoon, Meyer?
You're getting' 10 cc's
We can get the war started tomorrow, but it won't be pretty.
If ever I need a Boss, Joe.
You boys carryin' pieces?
So fuck him. I don't care anymore. Let him come.
Boss, I got all the time you need.
MONEY DON'T MEAN SHIT!
You and Vito are gonna pull that payroll job. Right now.
Conditions have changed. Some people have become too powerful.
The terms will be mine.
Tell it to the Calabrian. Tell it to the Jews.
Not by scurrying around like a puppies in a roomful of elephants.
The Big Picture.
Yes?
Know something Tommy? You're a mensch.
How do you get from <u>here</u> - to <u>there</u>?
What?
Chasing me - animals - horrible -
Olive or eyeball?
<i></i> I beg your pardon?
You're mad at me. Great. You have every right to be. But we're both mad at Dark Town. We're both mad at Hypnos.
I'm not going to tell you that. I wanted that E- ticket. I wanted it so bad I'd stare <u>you</u> right in the face to get it - and I'd do the same again.
I have a girl up there. And I never - I should've - I just want to tell her I love her.
Hey. Where's Monkeybone?
Back? You're sending me back?
Death! Thank you!
You're really gonna pop the question?
Herb. <u>I have to go</u>.
So here's my idea. We do a giveaway at the zoo benefit. We get a big piata. We fill it with Monkeybone dolls - <u>hundreds</u> of 'em.
NO! DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND?? HE'S GOT MY E-TICKET! HE'S GOT MY -
What's this about merchandising? You always hated merchandising!
Baby, don't lie. I know you went out.
Can't you give it to me later?
I'm fine, baby. We're all okay. We were lucky.
Oh, Julie...my poor Stu...my poor baby brother...
An hour ago. <i></i> I tried to prepare myself, but I didn't know he would be like, like <u>this</u>. I can't even bear to look at him... How about you? You're okay?
Kimmy, he doesn't know what's going on. He doesn't even know he's in a -
It's too soon even to - <u>talk</u> about that!
You're such a beautiful man. Look at you - stuck in this place, and only thinking of her.
Don't ask where I got it.
Go. Just <u>go</u>.
You are too! Mooning over Julie when we could <u>both</u> be gettin' some o' this fine local action. It's not like she's gonna know. Out of town, under five minutes, and in a coma don't <u>count</u>.
My Fellow Americans. I have a dream. Let us boldly go where no man has gone before.
I left my phone number in your undies. Try not to lose it in traffic.
Y'call that art? Why, my three-year-old can paint better than that.
Where'd he go??
Stu...Stu...
It's just...now that I'm leaving, I feel like there's lots of things I haven't said. Who's gonna look out for you? Are you gonna be okay when I'm gone?
Who told you we deal drugs?
So, what do you think?
I wanted to ask you something.  Those motorcycles across the street ...?
Dating anyone?
Mother, I ...
What's wrong?
Oh, that has nothing to do with it.
Mom, I need to talk to you.
I think you should consider coming out and staying with me longer.
Really?
What do you think?  I left it on the curb?
She would have come to the airport to meet me - she wanted to - but ... but, she just started a new job and, well, I guess no one drives here.
Ohhh.  Do you know the East Village?
Look out for those fellows--they tell the truth about you--sometimes. That corner over there is reserved for guides and sightseers who come in for five minutes to rest their feet. That section over there is reserved for Senator's friends. The front row--the empty one--is for the President and White House guests-- see that old couple over there-- they've attended every session for the last twenty years. Over the clock back here is the Diplomatic section. They and the page boys are the only real class we have in this place. The rest are mostly people who come here like they go to the zoo--
How do you *like* this! You don't suppose that ranger met up with some kids--and took 'em for a hike!
What's this, Diz?
Will you go chase an ambulance!
Did you like the first act?
Oh--yeah--
Do you know how I felt, Diz?
Like a mother sending her kid off to school for the first time--watchin' the little fella toddling off--in his best bib and tucker--and you sink in the middle--hoping he can stand up to the other kids--won't get his feeling hurt--and--if you could only spare him the knocks he's gotta take--  Say--who started this?
Well--cut it out. See? Who *cares* anyway?
How about getting married?
Okay. You don't mind?
No.
Where?
Hey! We're gettin' married--!
You know, we're getting married.
All I know is--he said to me tonight-- "What does your wife think?" My wife. Thinks we're married--
The war's on!
Diz!
No, no--believe me, pet--this is *most* urgent--  Hello, hello. Is Taylor there?-- Governor Hopper. Quickly, please--
Otis!
Good. Are the newspaper men at the hotel?
I *can't* wait, McGann! You go into that room and tell Jim Taylor and Joe Paine that I give them *one more minute*--
One minute! Just one minute!
*But you never asked me*!
Boy Ranger! The answer to a prayer. Manna from heaven! Didn't know the time of day--!
Yes! He's about to blow the whole machine to smithereens--and *you with it*, Mr. Governor!
No. No. A signal service to the State. Yes, indeed. And not only that but-- uh--I've heard of your excellent work in leading and guiding our youth--
Thanks, Governor--*yes*! Do you mind? His head--Ma'll take the tail.
What were you saying, Governor? Sorry.
What's the matter, Dad? Is it getting you down?
Gosh, Pop--head of the Boy Rangers!
Jeff for Senator.
Yes. Come in.
Maybe you'd like to come along and watch, Governor? Jefferson's done a wonderful job with that leg.
Just a minute, I better make sure.
You should hear our Ranger Band rattle that off--if you want to *hear* something! Good evening, Miss Saunders. Good evening Mister McGann.
Mr. President!
Ma's told me about it a thousand times.
Senator Paine, if I could do just that one thing while I'm here, I-- I'd feel that I--
Gosh!  Well--looks good as new. If there *is* any damage, I'll--
Mr. President--
Please, sir!--come with me!
Yes, Ma?
Jerry! Blackie! Queenie! Let's have it quiet, fellows!
Fine--
Now, if you're ready, Senator, we can start for the hotel. I'll *see* that you get there.
No, gee--I couldn't stay here--
If I were *triplets*, I couldn't--. Look, Senator--let me give you a rough idea. A member has a Bill in mind--like you--a camp. Right?
Oh, yes. And *I'm* helping. Simple-- and I'm helping. So we knock this off in record-breaking time of--let's say three or four days--
That's how Congress--or any large body--is run. All work has to be done by committee.
Pardon?
No! Go right ahead, Miss Saunders.
About two hundred of the most beautiful acres that ever were! Mountains, prairie land, trees, streams! A paradise for boys who live in stuffy cities--  You don't know that country out there, do you, Miss Saunders?
Have you always had to--work?
But--I mean--for a woman--And--you've done awfully well--
I never met anyone more--more intelligent--or capable. I--I don't know where I'd be on this bill of mine without your help--
You--you've *got* a first name, haven't you?
Susan! Susan Paine--that's beautiful--
And you're writing Ma all about it. And your pigeons will carry the message of love. And the first thing you know--Susan Paine'll get the best jar of preserves she ever tasted!
Yay!
Jeff--wait--they want you to speak!
Ah! That's more like it! What?
Well, goodbye, sir--and thank you again.  Well--it--it was nice seeing you, Miss Paine--
Funnier things have happened. Ma says when Pa was courting her, he acted strange for months. Didn't make sense--or anything. And one day, on a hunch, Ma said: "Clayton, so help me, you talk like a man whose collar is too tight to bear." "Not the collar, Mary," he said, "my shoes." "Well, for land's sake," Ma said, "Take the pesky things off!" Which Pa did, an' they were engaged within a week.
However, Senator Smith is still a member of this Body and as such has equal claim on the attention of the Chair--
Order, gentlemen!
Since the time of Adams--not Washington.
I said--I mean--Washington didn't live to see it finished. Congress didn't move here from Philadelphia till eighteen hundred.
Yes. Washington laid the cornerstone though--wearing an apron for the ceremony that was embroidered by Madame Lafayette--
Yeah! How about it? You're a nature lover. Do you handle any of that sign language?
What! Who?
The Head Man's writing a Bill.
You can't find it in racing forms, Chick.
H'ya, Carl--h'ya, Bill!
Joe! You *told* him to!
--amazing coincidence! Of all places in the world--to choose Willet Creek for his boys' camp!
Be quiet, Chick--I'm trying to think--  This Deficiency Bill is going to be read in the Senate tomorrow.
I know that.
Jim's methods won't do in Washington.
Your Ranger's on the garbage pile, Happy! He's done for!
Well, that's out. Either it's *lots* of reporters and *lots* of tickets or--. Now will you go and call 'em before I change my mind about the whole thing!
You want to see me, Senator?
The ranger's notices? No idea at all.
And I'm an old hand at following instructions--
What are you driving at? You want *me* to get him to sign that?
All right--*yes*! And what does that make me to him? *Nothing*! I've got to go about my own business--and forget it!
*Me! Me*! I *still* don't see why I should--! If you love him so much, why don't you go to him yourself and-- ? Or better still--get up in that Senate and *fight* for him!
That Happy Hopper is tougher to handle than a prima-donna.
Joe--I've got a lot of people to take care of in this State.
We can't drop it now, Joe. We bought the land around this Dam and we're holding it in dummy names. If we drop it or delay it--we are going to bring about investigations, and investigations will show that we own that land and are trying to sell it to the State under phoney names. No, Joe, in my judgment the only thing to do is push this Dam through--and get it over with.
Wait a minute, boys. Happy may have hit on something tremendous here. Rather than let Miller or anyone else in at this stage, we simply put blinders on this simple son of nature-- and turn him loose on monuments. He's completely out of the way in Washington, and as Happy says, you make political capital out of it at home.
That's him. Let him in.
You won't stand for it?
Jim--the boy's talking to that State-- the story is out--!
How nice.
I accuse this man--by his tone--by his careful denials--he is deliberately trying to plant damaging impressions of my conduct--! *I'll* tell you why we were in tht room. Because Mr. Taylor, a respected citizen of our State, had brought with him the evidence against this man, later presented from this floor, and *we were urging him to resign*-- !
Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?
No. Don't ever want to go out without telling us.
Put that away, slug!  At your service!
Most every day.
He sure is pixilated.
All right, Mr. Dodsworth. I think you'll qualify.  Take this to that desk over there for further instructions.
You don't go out with girls very much, do you?
Are they true!
And you saw them happen?
That's all, Miss Bennett.
Oh, thank you!
Your Honor, this is absurd. The woman's obviously in love with him.
You are , aren't you?
You fainted.
Look - there's Brookfield, the poet.
The Aquarium was swell. If I lived in New York, I'd go there every day. I'll bet you do.
There you are. Grant's Tomb. I hope you're not disappointed.
There's Times Square.
Really?
Oh, yes. I used to have a lot of fun there when I was a little girl. I used to love to go fishing with my father. That's funny. He was a lot like you, my father was. Talked like you, too. Sometimes he'd let me hold the line while he smoked - and we'd just sit there for hours. And after awhile, for no reason, I'd go over and kiss him and sit in his lap. He never said very much but once I remember him saying: "No matter what happens, honey, don't complain."
Mary, I'm going home.
Do you mind if I talk to you, Mary? You don't have to pay any attention to me.
Good night.
You're acting like a school girl.
Cinderella Man! That's sensational, Babe! Sensational!
What's bothering you, huh?
Sorry, Babe. Sorry. It would have made a swell story. I just got carried away. That's too bad. So he proposed to you, huh?  What a twist! You set out to nail him - and he
It don't look as though we're gonna get any pictures tonight.
I wonder if they'd want to make it a quartet.
The gentlemen from the opera are still waiting in the board room, sir. They're getting a trifle impatient, sir.
Fourteen carat?
How is this, sir?
Nuisance value?
Must we have the echo?
It's a lie!
Well, your uncle was Chairman of the Board of Directors. They probably expect you to carry on.
Where?
Well, you see, your uncle didn't bother with that sort of thing. He left everything to us. He traveled most of the time, and enjoyed himself. You should do the same thing, Mr. Deeds.
Come in, please. Come in. Can I get you a cup of tea?
Have a drink?
Fine. Send it right away. I don't want him to fire Arthur.
You'd better get right down there. That opera mob is about to break into the Mad Song from "Lucia."[2]
And what'd you do to those bodyguards? They quit this morning. Said you locked them up.
If they're going to poke fun at me, I'm going to
But what about this "Cinderella Man"?
Yeah - that's all that's worrying you. What do I want?  A chance to feed a wife and kids! I'm a farmer. A job! That's what I want!
I leave it to you, Mr. Deeds. Can you conceive of any court not being in sympathy with any woman who gave up the best years of her life for an old man like your uncle?
I'm glad to see you're willing to be reasonable, Mr. Deeds.
Of course, we don't want to appear greedy, Mr. Deeds.
There's one nice thing about being rich - you ring a bell and things happen. When the servant comes in, Mr. Hallor, I'm going to ask him to show you to the door. Many people don't know where it is.
No.
Proceed.
Now about the Falkner sisters. That's kind of funny. I mean about Mr. Cedar going all the way to Mandrake Falls to bring them here. Do you mind if I talk to them?
Mr. Deeds, you haven't yet touched upon a most important thing. This rather fantastic idea of yours to want to give away your entire fortune. It is, to say the least, most uncommon.
Anything else, Mr. Deeds?
Proceed.
How about lunch? Are the gentlemen going to stay - or not?
No, he's too fussy for that. That's what's the matter with him. There are lots of nice girls right here in Mandrake Falls who're dying to be married
Where is your farm?
You're Mabel - her sister - aren't you?
It would be a nice night to go for a walk, don't you think?
No, sir.
He talks about women as if they were cattle.
A Prairie Oyster, sir.[10]
I'd better call her up and apologize. I don't remember taking her home last night.
You came home last night - without them.
Yes, sir. I beg pardon, sir, but did you ever find what you were looking for, sir?
But she's on the telephone
Why, that's an echo, sir!
Yes, sir. What is it, sir? Anything happened3
But she isn't due for an hour, sir.
They said if I didn't get help, they wouldn't deal with me any more.  What do you think about that?
Oh, all the great writers -- Shakespeare, Charles Dickens, Moby Dick... those people. Each is bound in genuine premium leather with 22 carat gold accents. It's a magnificent set -- and only $33.50 per volume. Right away you get Great Expectations for just $6.99.
We argued on Sunday. He went to work on Monday and stayed in the city during the week, like always. But on Thursday, when he normally comes home, he didn't. Didn't call either. Not till Saturday afternoon.
It's happened before.  I'm shocked by how little I'm feeling. I can't understand it.  I'll probably have a complete depressoid collapse soon, won't I?
Dr. Mumford.
I'm not sure she'll come. She's in a mood. Do you ever go to somebody's house?
What Ernest means, I think, is we're very interested in other methodology... different kinds of training. We're great believers in learning from each other. I've learned so much from Ern -- Dr. Delbanco...
Phyllis, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to shout...
I've run on. Forgive me. We're here to talk about you.
My mentor was an amazing teacher named Benton Mandlebaum. Died quite tragically in the collapse of a gazebo.
No?
I was... never satisfied.
Let me just say something here... I have no idea if this is going to help.
I didn't see you there. Can I help you?
It's all right, it won't bite you. Under civil code 1294.67b you are entitled to be notified that your status and certification are being reviewed. This is the notice.
You must be Dr. Mumford of Mumford. Jeremy Brockett.
Well, in '85 four of us left our firms and formed an investment banking venture. We've got twenty-three people working there now.
No... I mean about Althea. About her...  ...behavior. Do you think you can fix her up?
Are you disrespecting this court, Mr. White?
So, is this like a Japanese restaurant?
That's a lot of people all at once.
You're early... it's not ready. What happened?
Does the phrase "nosy" have any meaning to you, Lily?
You know who that is, don't you?  You really don't? That's Skip Skipperton, man. He gets himself hit by a truck, this whole town shuts down.
How ya doin', Ainge? Evenin', Lily.
It was insane here, man. 'Hadda call in the National Guard.  Then I did my laundry... watched 20/20.
Lily, I want you to meet Skip. Skip, Lily.
Yes, you do, you damn well do.
...but it's not really my school -- and this is very interesting -- it's the school from the next district --
I just got my license two weeks ago.
How are you?
What'd you want?
Finally, some common sense...
Wow. You're something.
I don't know. I barely made it today.
You have the best answer for everything.  You seem so... hopeful. Are you always this sunny?
I'm not making any promises.
Is that the technical description of what I've got?
We don't discuss it.
I've offended you!
Is this the treatment?
I'm embarrassed. The list is so long.
Sore throat?
Yeah, most people have that. It's confusing here.
I can give myself a headache instantly.
It doesn't matter. Go on.
...who thinks there's nothing really wrong with me.
And I'll bet you can interpret the whole thing
And he's where?
And this is legitimate therapy?
You're shockingly honest, that's what makes you great. I've never had a man treat me this way. With you, I feel really... listened to.  Can I tell you something? It's a little embarrassing, but I feel very unguarded with you.
I guess you saw the show...?
Sofie...
I am irate!
But, there is one... mitigating factor I want you to consider before you write me off.
I knew you wouldn't answer. I've been thinking about what you said last time. How me trying to lose weight -- and constantly not -- is like a lot of people with addictions. How maybe I can't lose the weight, ever...  Which we already knew...
Isn't she amazing? That is such a wicked look.
I want to have the session. I thought it would be cool if I could show you some of the things that interest me. But I guess you're not into it... which we already knew.
What are you talking about?
What did he want you to do?
...What balls on this guy? What're we...  ...going steady? Jesus.
I said I'd consider it. Nobody owns me. And the last thing was insane. I don't know what's wrong with him... No magazines.
You're Doc Mumford.  Skip Skipperton.
I hope you don't think I want you to do this for free. Just because we're gonna play it like we're friends, doesn't mean I won't pay you like a doctor.
This is great!
She's probably ten years older than you.
Well, there's Lily.
Yeah, well... what I was gonna tell you --
That's right. And you also know that even though I make 23% of the modems in the world... I cannot make one simple connection with any woman who could truly love me.
Slash what?
A doll?
Damn! What is your name?
-- an investigator for the Internal Revenue Service?
Sounds like you have several.
Did you carry a gun?
And the drugs?
What about it?
But you studied psychology, right? You did the training and just never got the degree?
I've never brought anyone down here before.
Doc, there's something about what you told me the other night I can't get out of my head. It's driving me batty --  Why me? How did you know you could trust me?
I guess that makes sense.
Doc!... It's not me, is it?
O'Connell! I am going to kill you for this!
Ten to one, O'Connell, your odds are no-so-good.
What just happened?
See the cartouche there, it's the official royal seal of Seti the First, I'm sure of it.
In the necropolis, when I saw him, - alive,... walking, he called me Anck- su-namun. And then in Mister Burns' quarters he tried to kiss me.
I'm thinking that if the black Book Of The Dead can bring people back to life --
Then we will kill her, we will kill her and all those with her.
I'm willin, to go on a little faith, here.
See! That proves it! Old Seti's fortune's gotta be under this sand!
The hell with this. I'm goin, downstairs to get me a drink. You want somethin'?
No women allowed.
You were actually at Hamunaptra?
Yeah, I was there.
Yes.
Give... give him... give him GLAAAA-- !
Sorry, didn't mean to scare ya.
There's something out there, you know, something under that sand.
For what?
A key! That's it! That's what he was talking about.
Unlike your brother, Miss, you I don't get. You're a whole new brew.
I think you were jealous
Got guts, lady.
You...! YOU...!
Well I wish you'd do it sooner rather than later, before you ruin my career the way you've ruined yours.
You stole it from a drunk at the local Casbah?!
Ah, begging your pardon, but shouldn't we be going?
It's called mummification. You're dead when they do this
I can't believe I allowed the two of you to get me drunk.
What do I do, Evy!? What do I do!?
Ummm, Hootash im... Hootash im now what is this last symbol here?
Ah! Ah! Ahmenophus!
I can't believe the price of these fleabags.
Whoever's in here, sure wasn't getting out.
Where's my gun?
Who's here!?
Believe it, sister. That's what brought our buddy back to life.
But did you know I knew you'd know I'd know?
The jig is up, Casanova. I've spent six months watching you, and know exactly what you're up to.
Um-hmm.
Where are you going?
Look, honey, being a superhero... it's a guy thing.
Atta, girl!
How about... the Savage Six?
But she's your mother. You gotta tell her.
Hey... Can I buy you a beer?
Casanova said that in two days the entire city would belong to him... and there wasn't a thing that we could do about it.
Elizabeth! Little Elizabeth! Why you're so... middle aged!
He'll never make it.
Have you considered my offer?
That boy's got talent.
What did you do with Captain Amazing?
I'll let you in on a little secret, Roy. In two days this entire city will belong to me, and there's not a damn thing your little pals can do about it. It's the perfect time to switch teams... So what do you say?
Let me guess... Bullets don't hurt you.
Are you an actress?
Hi.
Who's the artist?
What?
Who?
Hi.
Monica... I was wondering if -- uh -- maybe we -- I mean you and I -- could -- uh -- you know -- get a -- I mean have a...
Most people just want to make money or be famous or something. But you risk everything, just to help people.
I've never been able to figure out what to do with my life, which is why I guess I'm still a waitress.
Me too... I love this stupid old town. It's noisy. It's smelly. It's falling apart.
It's me.
There's a big difference.
So what else has Superman got?
Cover me!
He's Lance Hunt! Just take off the glasses -- and it's him!
Why do they always fill stuff these things so full you can't pull 'em out without ripping 'em! 
What does it matter? Women just want to control you -- and talk about their feelings. They want to know why you're angry all the time -- and what can they can do to help -- so you tell them there's nothing -- nothing -- just leave me alone -- but they bug you and they bug you and they bug you -- until you just can't stand it anymore! -- so you finally open up -- you pop like a blister -- and it all comes spewing out -- all your emotions -- your feelings -- your fears -- all of it!  And then they dump you.
Maybe she's right.
Agents?
But... only when no one is looking.
Really?
Jeffrey, YOU THIEF!
And why are you wearing that silly costume?
Oh, Mother, I'm sorry. I know how much you wanted me to be a doctor or a lawyer with a family -- but it's just not who I am!
Hi.
This is bad.
We may be getting in over our heads here.
We're outnumbered twenty to one.
Where am I going?
I believe I am right in saying that, before the fire, the country had grown weary of the war, and there were few who were interested in continuing the battle.
But, since the fire, a completely new spirit has been aroused in the nation.  The French have become an army of criminals, against whom Russia must be avenged, against whom she is now prepared to fight to the death.
Proceed.
What do you think Napoleon will do?
Yes, Captain?  Have you anything you wish to say?
Thank you for coming.  Would you care for a drink?
There are none here.
These are odds of 8 to 1.
I believe it was arranged by Marshals Mortier and Marmont.  I must explain to you that we have had no orders all day.  Each marshal has been keeping his own position.
I don't know, sire.
I don't know what has happened to Prince Joseph.
Who is there?
I believe you are acquainted with my brother, Joseph Bonaparte, and my aide, Major Junot.
Was it he who assigned you to command the escort which accompanied Madame Bonaparte's coach?
I haven't been there for three years.
How did it spread so quickly?
Earlier this afternoon, the Emperor refused the hand of the Grand Duchess Anna, of Russia, and, as I'm sure you can appreciate, he is quite able to change his mind again.  For the Emperor, to choose a wife, is only a matter of minutes.
I'm sorry that I am unable to offer you better hospitality, but this is the only place I have inhabited for the past month.
I'm afraid I am, just a bit.
No -- not as a rule.
Good evening, sir.
The weather is terrible, isn't it, sir?
No, I'm only here on leave.  My regiment is at Valence.
Well, it must be a good deal warmer than it is here on the street.
Only Lisette?
Naturally, one does not take much stock in such a piece of filth but, on the other hand, it is not the sort of thing one can simply ignore. What do you think, Joseph?
No -- Captain Charles commanded the cavalry escort, and rode outside the carriage.  In the evenings, he always ate at another table.  They hardly ever spoke to each other.
Yes, of course, I would.  You know I am not one of your wife's greatest admirers, but I certainly know nothing about this.
The comedy of my marriage is sufficiently well known already.
Of course not, but such violence of feeling makes me wonder.
When is she supposed to return?
Oh... how very nice of you to bring that for Eugene... Did General de Beauharnais give it to you?
Were you in love with him?
Do you expect me to believe that?
Were any of them prettier than I am?
Were any of them married?
She must have been in love with you.
Promise me.
Perhaps -- but tell me you promise, anyway.
Yes -- what is it?
Oh -- now, this is absolutely ridiculous!  If you don't want to be humiliated in front of your guests, you will return to the table at once.
But you will not... be safe...
Who is it?
I didn't mean the things that I said... I was angry and I said more than I meant to.
Well, anyway, sorry to call you away from the festivities, but where is the breakdown on serviceable vehicles?  I asked for it yesterday.
Well, maybe he's only looking out for your best interests.
What?
You wrote it.
You couldn't face telling me what?
Are you trying to provoke me, monsieur?
Do you like music?
Will it be possible to have my dog, Bijou, sent here?  I was not allowed to bring her and I love her so much.
Papa said only to comply with any request you might make of me.
Do you know the joke about the two Swiss boys who go to a bordello for the first time?
Those are extremely harsh terms.
Do you think Alexander has any chance to succeed as a mediator?
England can make no move against you on the Continent without Austria.  A reliable treaty with Austria would end her hopes in that regard.
Not one I should like to rely on. Francis is still smarting under the terms he had to accept after Austerlitz, and he is under great pressure to recover his losses.
What I am talking about is moderation.
And where do you place Alexander?
Sire, you have only enemies in the court of St. Petersburg, and I fear outside your influence, Alexander will have another look at what he has agreed to.
I suggest that you leave with your men while you can.
Yo' cousin, Craig.  Hook us up.
I know you smoke weed, right?
I don't know, I think I passed out or something.  I don't remember.
Where's that boy that told me Day-Day was here?
Where you going?
Great moves, Day-Day.
What's the green stuff poking out?
Naw, I already ate.
Man, Day-Day is my people!
What's crackin'?
Yep.  I forgot about him cussin' out everybody.  Damn that was fun.
Pinky's Records and Disc in the shopping center.  I'mma talk to my boss and see if he got a little position for you.  'Cause you been unemployed for a long time now, Craig.
I can't see!  I can't see!  Daddy!
What's the matter with your girlfriend?
Damn, you got a stalker.
Why?
What's the matter?
Thanks a lot, Craig.
I didn't think you smoked bud that much.
You see that?
How you know?  It could be anything.
You alright?
Delivery!
Naw, I play for the Chocamunga Cracker Killers.  You want tickets?
Here I come!
Must be your upper lip, 'cause I don't smell nothing.
Hold up, Elroy, that's my boy.  Craig, what the hell wrong with you?  Where you been?
Nigga, you got knock the fuck out.
Yeah, I'm 'bout it.
Why for?  Them boys are real player haters.
Are they still out there?
Try an' hold it, man.  Squeeze your ass cheeks together.
You wanna knock?
What?!  What that mean?
Get 'em, Craig!
Hey, guys, I'm outta here.
Hey, man, the pleasure's all mine. Thanks for the dog, and the money.  Maybe my dad won't kick my ass tonight.
Uh...um...I mean uh, can we borrow a cup of sugar?
What you say?
You too big.
Are you going to take me to see Mom?
You didn't call the Sandwich Joint with a urgent message?
Somebody left me a message.  Well where's Craig and Day-Day?
What about that ugly dog?
Mr. Nasty time?
During a campaign every speech is important. This is free media exposure. Primetime news coverage that we couldn't buy.
Amtrack?
Better in San Diego? More opportunity there? What?
Mrs. Grant, Governor...I won't hurt you.
If I were here to hurt you I would have done it already.
I remember you...in the elevator.
You shot her?
What?
I knew you wouldn't believe me.
I...1 would like to...thank you, Mister Wat... Gene.
Could I see some identification, sir?
Is this about those kids? Look, I'm sorry about that. But they darn near...
Come with us, sir.
Yes, yes, I understand.
This is for you. In it there is a picture of a woman and an itinerary. It is her itinerary. She is presently - are you listening, Mr. Watson?
This says "invitation only".
How should I...?
I'm not stupid.. I know how this is supposed, to work.
Come back.
Again.
I don't know.
I think you better put that away.
Lynn!
Yes, sweetie, it's me.
No, honey, not to be a hero. But I want you to remember something for me, all right?
No. Kisses to you.
What do you do, if I may be so bold?
I have to do something.
There was a woman. She was trying to help me. I watched him murder her.
Irene is going to help.
What am I supposed to say to her?
Just giving you the gift of a clean windshield. Only cost you a dollar.
For the last time, I don't want it cleaned. Now get the hell out of here!
I don't have to pay you nothin'.
You stole that.
I've got something for you.
Somebody mind telling me... ) What the hell happened!?
I'm looking for them.
And what happens if I don't call you?
Come Back.
You killed two men, Ben Harper.
With that ten thousand dollars I could build a Tabernacle that'd make the Wheeling Island Tabernacle look like a chicken-house!
Ain't seen you in a coon's age, Johnny.
Can't hear ye, boy.  ...So the big boats heave a sigh, They blow for Uncle Birdie...
O, she's all right.
Uncle Birdie!
And the Lord told that man --
The Lord said, Take that money and throw it in the River!
See ye got two more peeps to your brood.
Plan on a longer visit next time.
Who?
What can we do, Mother?
Sure, but you was worried too, Mother; takin' off with never a word of goodbye. I even got to figurin' them gypsies busted in and done off with all three of 'em.
Lynch him! Lynch him!
Willa Harper there is certain plain facts of life that adds up just like two plus two makes four and one of them is this: No woman is good enough to raise growin' youngsters alone! The Lord meant that job for two!
John...
Pearl! You ain't --
John?
Don't you hurt her!
What's taking you so long about it?
What's that you're playing with, boy?
I knowed your Daddy.  And do you know what your Daddy said to me? He said, "Tell my little girl Pearl there's to be no secrets between her and you."
Sure, that's no secret.
Yes; John's bad.
I'm hungry.
Why, you're the purtiest girl I've seen in all my wandering. Didn't nobody never tell you that, Ruby?
Is there anythin' -- anythin'...?
Didn't you have no inkling?
Harry!
You thought, Willa, that the moment you walked in that door I'd start in to pawing you in the abominable way men are supposed to do on their wedding night. Ain't that right, now?
Get up, Willa.
Mornin', ladies.
Gracious, gracious! You are a good woman, Miz Cooper!
The Lord is merciful! What a day is this! -- And there's little John!
What are you after them for?
Pearl and John!
Miz Cooper. I never went to sewin' lessons all them times.
Nightmares are expected after psychological trauma. Don't worry, they go away.
What the hell are dreams, anyway?
It's just a stupid cat.
Why's she so bothered by a stupid nightmare, anyway?
Hello?
The killer.
Me?  Wait a minute, you can't bring someone out of a dream!
What!?
She dreamed this would happen...
Only family allowed, Nancy. You know the drill.
He's dangerous.
Dad -- what you doing here?
-- I want you to come over here and break the door down exactly twenty minutes from now -- can you do that?
Tell her I'm not here, tell her...
What?
No television, forget the homework, no phone calls.
Did you ask Daddy to have the hat examined?
Screw sleep!
Oh lawyers got fat and the judge got famous, but someone forgot to sign the search warrant in the right place, and Fred Krueger was free, just like that.
Bunch of us parents tracked him down after they let him go. Found him in an old boiler room, just like before. Saw him lying there in that caked red and yellow sweater he always wore, drunk an' asleep with his weird knives by his side...
I can't believe his mother let him come over here.
What you dream?
What the hell you doing here?
No more fights?
Bring me forty-five back.
From Leon.
Aren't you late?
When I passed through the laundry yard today I saw all the women huddled around this so I brought it up here. Things like this create a bad feeling. First they didn't know whose it was. Then they saw the Paris label and did it start a commotion! Some said it's what we all ought to wear and others said it's like hanging foreign ideas on our clothesline. It undermines our whole cause.
You know how it is today... all you have to do is wear a pair of silk stockings and they suspect you of counter-revolution.
It was very silly.... I would be ashamed to wear it here.
What is it, Anna?
Comrades! Comrades! Don't let's give in so quickly. After all we have to uphold the prestige of Russia.
You wouldn't like Razinin.
If you hadn't given Commissar Razinin such a wonderful report about us, who knows what would have happened?
Let's fill it with confitures, des prunes...
Now Comrades, I warn you... if it gets out in Moscow that we stay in the Royal Suite we will get into terrible trouble.
She's right...  anyhow let's talk ourselves into it.
We can say whatever we want. We can shout... we can complain... Look...  The service in this hotel is terrible!  See? Nobody comes... nobody pays any attention. That's freedom.
I am Comrade Buljanoff.
Do you spell Buljanoff with one or two f's?
Is there anything I can do, Comrade?
It is high time you got out of Russia.
Guest?
Not that we are giving in one inch, but tell us... what is in your mind?
Boys, boys... don't forget Russia is your mother country. Three sons walking out all at once... that's too much for any mother.
A blue shirt, perhaps?
Good evening, Gaston.
Count d'Algout, there have been several telephone...
They hope the settlement will bring you a fortune.
Good evening, Your Highness.
I don't want to go to the Hotel Terminus.
You know, Monsieur Mercier, this is all non-sense.
That was our idea when we first came. All we thought we would get out of this trip was a Turkish bath, but... we learned better.
I suppose you expect us to hand over the jewels?
What's the name of that Commissar on the Board of Trade?
And if we have to go to Siberia...
A week?
Do you know how much a cow costs, Comrade Iranoff?
Bad news?
I might be able to accommodate you. Is there some more luggage?
What's new?
Will you send me some cigarettes, please?  Comrades, I am not in a position to pass final judgment but at best you have been careless in your duty to the State.  You were entrusted with more than a mere sale of jewelry. Why are we peddling our precious possessions to the world at this time? Our next year's crop is in danger and you know it. Unless we can get foreign currency to buy tractors there will not be enough bread for our people. And you three comrades...
And your own gas cooker? That's marvelous!  Naturally it's not the Royal Suite...
On the contrary -- I don't want to have anything to do with them.
I want to see a friend of mine... a very dear friend.... It's a personal matter which has nothing to do with politics or social philosophies.... It's a girl.
Yes!
What for... why?
You, please.
For my own information would you call your approach toward me typical of the local morale?
You are very sure of yourself, aren't you?
Then you don't want me to go there.
Is this what you call the "butler"?
He looks sad. Do you whip him?
Well, may I offer you a drink, or how about something to eat?
I should say this room is eighteen by twenty-five.
And what do you do for mankind?
Your general appearance is not distasteful.
Don't do it, please.
It's never too late to change. I used to belong to the petty bourgeoisie myself. My father and mother wanted me to stay and work on the farm, but I preferred the bayonet.
I was wounded before Warsaw.
Then do it through my lawyer!
Room service speaking.
Pardon me for addressing you but you insulted him, you know that. You hurt his feelings. It was just like telling a musician you don't like music. That good old man believes in food as you believe in Karl Marx. You can't go around hurting people, Comrade Yakushova, but maybe you can make it up to him. Do you know how?  By eating everything with relish, by drinking everything with gusto, by having a good time for the first time in your natural life!
Just smile.
I suppose you don't think that's funny?
It seemed funny to me when I first heard it. Maybe the trouble isn't with the joke. Maybe it's with you!
I'll tell you that joke again. A man comes into a restaurant. Did you get that?
He sits down at the table and says to the waiter... Did you get that too?
I don't look too foolish?
You see? Life can be so simple.
Leon, I would like to ask you something.
She is very attractive. She has great elegance.  She's what you call a woman of the world, isn't she?
Quickly, please... tell me one of your funny stories.
Go on.
Wonderful -- if one could believe it.
Comrades! Comrades!
No speech.
Not white, darling.
And we won't stretch up our arms...
...and we won't clench our fist...
...they are the tears of Old Russia... see that stone?
Comrades! People of the world! The revolution is on the march... I know... wars will wash over us... bombs will fall... all civilization will crumble... but not yet, please... wait, wait... what's the hurry?  Let us be happy... give us our moment....  We are happy, aren't we, Leon?
Trying to keep me away from you! It couldn't be done. Naturally I couldn't go on forever punching passport officials in the nose -- but I found a way, didn't I? Darling, I had to see you. I wrote and wrote but all my letters came back.
What a gruesome proof of the power of the press!
My little Volga boatman! Stop threatening! I don't deserve this.  Are you my little Volga boatman?
You just told me you hadn't seen her.
Yes, Swana, you did.
He won another blue ribbon and bit the judge. Ha! ha! ha! I bought him the cutest sweater as a reward. You should see him strut down the street in it. He looks like a little boulevardier.  You see, Count d'Algout gave me Punchy for my birthday.  You must have searched weeks before you found anything as divine as Punchy, didn't you, Leon?
There's a charming crowd here tonight, isn't there?
Leon, darling, how nice! Have you ordered tea or a cocktail?
Now, please, Swana.
Not at all.... I understand perfectly, Count d'Algout gave you a dog. You made it very clear, madame.
Good morning.
I think we can cut your visit short. Leon is not here.
How stale last night's gaiety looks! It has the taste of a dead cigarette.
My palace in Petrograd... yes, you took that away from me. You took away my czar, my country, my people, everything I had...  but nothing more -- I warn you.
You can't deny we gave the people their money's worth -- almost -- eight tumbling Romanoffs -- eight!
Where are they?
Now, let's free ourselves from emotionalism and try to solve the problem in a practical way. Our situation has changed considerably. Before I had only a claim to the jewels. Now I have the jewels.
Unfortunately.
I am willing to hand over the jewels and sign the necessary papers if you take that five-forty plane to Moscow.
You mean you have finished the whole investigation?
Well, Comrade, I am afraid you will have to turn over that work to someone else.
Well, there's Pruniers if you care for seafood. If you want to lunch in the Bois, there's...
At Pre Mathieu's.
Your Highness.
Your Highness, forgive this intrusion, but...
Sir, if I may ... echo my concern ...
We'll see about that ...
Well, he certainly isn't acting like it.
So, what about those Watergate clowns, John?  This fuck Sirica's crazy. Thirty-five-year sentences!  There were no weapons.  Right?  No injuries. There was no success!  It's just ridiculous.
Sir, I still don't think, uh, we can contain it anymore.  There's a cancer on the presidency.  And it's growing. With every day that ...
I understand that, sir.
To protect his people.
Martha's an idiot, she'll do anything to get John's attention.  If Mitchell'd been minding the store instead of that nut Martha we wouldn't have that kid Magruder runnin' some third-rate burglary!  Was he smoking pot?
It's more than that.  It could be more than that.  I want Hunt paid.
Why not?
I end the longest war in American history and they keep harping on this chickenshit!  You know who's behind this, don't you -- it's Teddy Kennedy! He drowns a broad in his car and he can't run for president.
It'll never wash.  Pardoning them means we're guilty.  The people, the press will go nuts.
Sorry ...
Who?
Richardson won't do that.  He'll resign.
June twenty-third, '72, sir.  The part that's underlined.  Your instructions to Haldeman regarding the CIA and the FBI.
Sir, the deadline is today.
Sir, you talked about opening up the whole "Bay of Pigs" thing again.
Three days before, on the June twentieth tape -- the one with the eighteen-minute gap --
Their fourth!
Well, you know, sir, he's a nut.  He used to work here with the "Plumbers" and now he's running this Watergate caper.  You remember his plan to firebomb the Brookings using Cubans as firemen?  He wanted to buy a damned fire truck!  Magruder thinks he's just nutty enough to go off the reservation.
Well, why not?
But what are we paying him for?
How about a COMINT classification?  We put it on the Huston plan.  Even the designation is classified.
Should we talk to Trini about paying these guys?  Or maybe Chotiner?
Pat Gray'll do anything we ask him. That's why I appointed him.
Christ, you're right -- Gray makes Jerry Ford look like Mozart.  Just have Helms call him.  Helms can scare anybody.
Where are they?
The first assassination attempt was in '60, just before the election.
Alright.  But why, if Kennedy is so clean in all this, didn't he cancel Track 2?
Get that little fucker!  Great tackle! Reminds me of my days at Whittier. Most of these kids are useless.
You know, they all miss the point. Probably our biggest achievement as an administration, when it's all said and done, isn't China or Russia.  It's pulling out of Vietnam without a right wing revolt.
Congratulations, boss.  A great victory!  The madman theory wasn't so crazy after all.
You know why they're turning on me? They're not serious about power, that's why.  They're playing with power.  They're forgetting the national interest.  In the old days, people knew how to hold power, how to set limits.  They wouldn't have torn this country apart over a third-rate burglary. All they care about now are their egos, looking good at cocktail parties ...
We could leverage Helms.
I promised Iran to Townsend.
More light, chief?
... There can be no whitewash at the White House ... two wrongs do not make a right.  I love America.  God bless America and God bless each and every one of you.
We haven't said grace yet.  Richard.
I can't ...
It's a gift, Richard.  This law school is a gift from your brother.
What'd you say?
Oh, no, Harold.  He doesn't respond well to humor.  Maybe if you talk to Mother she can ...
I'm honored, Dick, that you've come all this way out here to Virginia to visit us at last.
I suppose, "Mister President," you're unhappy that we have not implemented your Domestic Intelligence plan, but ...
Diem?  Trujillo?  Lumumba?  Guatemala? Cuba? ... It's a shame you didn't take similar precautions, Dick.
President Kennedy threatened to smash the CIA into a thousand pieces.  You could do the same ...
Not if I give you all the cards ...
Mr. Helms, we've lived with Communism in Cuba for ten years ...
Yeah, well, as I said, Edgar ...
Why, you got a customer?
Howard ... What the hell?  What're you doing?
Mein Kampf?
Thanks, Jack.  You sure throw a helluva party.
And whose fault is that?  If we'd won in Vietnam ...
Desi's got a point.  What the hell are we gonna do about the Communists right here in our backyard?!
This will get me a second term.  Damn it, without risk, there's no heroism. There's no history.  I, Nixon, was born to do this.
Housecleaning?  It would be ugly, Henry, really ugly ...
All kinds of shit would come out. Like the Ellsberg thing.  You knew about that, Henry, didn't you?
Mr. Nixon, it is possible for even a president to go too far.
But your writings have changed the world, Mr. Chairman.
Don't ever trust them.  They never tell the truth or honor their commitments.  Vietnamese are like Russians.  Both are dogs.
So ... how's the food over there in China, Mr. Nixon?
How about Kissinger along with him?
It was illegal, what he did.
Let's get out of here; it's too painful.  I hate it.  We went bowling last weekend.  Next weekend we're going to the zoo. Whoever said there was life after politics was full of shit.
It wasn't your fault.  The soldiers were just kids, too.  They panicked.
... Somebody should shoot the little bastard.
Where you from?
... I don't really know you yet, Sandy ... What do you like?  I mean, what kind of clothes do you like?  Do you like blue ... red?
What kind of, uh ... music do you like?
No, we don't!  You're full of shit! You say you want to end the war, so why don't you?  My brother died over there last November.  Why?  What good was his death?
No, no.  I'm not powerless.  Because ... because I understand the system. I believe I can control it.  Maybe not control it totally.  But ... tame it enough to make it do some good.
What's in there?
Of them.
It makes us human ...
I'll concede in the morning.
My God -- divorce?  What about the girls?
It would ruin us, Buddy, our family.
This is just what they want, Buddy. Don't you see it?  They want to drive us apart.  To beat us.  We can't let them do it.  We've been through too much together, Buddy ... We belong together.
It was our dream, too, Buddy, together ... always.
This.  Above all.
You're the strongest woman I ever met. I love you, Buddy.
Howya doin'!  New York treating you okay?  I'm sorry I haven't been able to see you at all--
But being out of the game gives me time to write.
Hey, you know Henry Kissinger -- he's down from Harvard.  On my staff, foreign policy whiz ...
Didn't know there was any.
That man that shot you died in prison.
Nineteen zero and nine.
No money in his room there?
Signs and wonders. But I think once you stop hearin' sir and madam the rest is soon to follow.
Well what would you call him.
He won't neither. He never has.
Who's Charlie Walser. Oh! Well, I, uh... True story? I couldn't swear to ever detail but... it's certainly true that it is a story.
Yes ma'am?
Yes ma'am, I do.
Carla Jean...
You wouldn't think a car would burn like that.
I'd say it is. Not a doubt in my mind.
Well. Old age flattens a man.
...You ride Winston.
I know this truck. Belongs to a feller named Moss.
...Somebody unloaded on this thing with a shotgun.
...How come do you reckon the coyotes ain't been at 'em?
...I believe they've done lit a shuck.
Probably must be.
You gonna drive out there?
...I love you more'n more, ever day.
I mean, would you care to join me.
I got it Mama.
No.
No.
I wouldn't worry about it.
Llewelyn!
Llewelyn.
...If I don't come back tell Mother I love her.
Odessa.
Well thanks for fallin' all over and apologizing.
Promise?
Llewelyn?
You are comin back, ain't ya?
We don't have to do this. I'm a daytrader. I could just go home.
Do you have any idea how goddamn crazy you are?
Well I'd say he's at work. Do you want to leave a message?
Where does he work?
Huh? What is...
...Where's the transponder?
All right.
Yes, I do. I think you do too. So this is what I'll offer. You bring me the money and I'll let her go. Otherwise she's accountable. The same as you. That's the best deal you're going to get. I won't tell you you can save yourself because you can't.
How much?
What way would that be?
...Will there be somethin' else?
Will there be anything else?
Well... I need to see about closin'.
You don't know what you're talking about, do you?
You're a bit deaf, aren't you? I said what time do you go to bed.
...If that's the way you wanna put it.
You need to call it. I can't call it for you. It wouldn't be fair. It wouldn't even be right.
Yes you did. You been putting it up your whole life. You just didn't know it. You know what date is on this coin?
Don't put it in your pocket. It's your lucky quarter.
Well you give me the model number of the tent I can order you the poles.
What kind of tent?
Well I guess that'd be our ten-foot backyard Per-Gola. You can stand up in it. Well, some people could stand up in it. Six foot clearance at the ridge. You might just could.
Don't stop. Just ride me up past the rooms.
Okay.
He killed three men in a motel in Del Rio yesterday. And two others at that colossal goatfuck out in the desert.
...An attempt at humor, I suppose.
...You pick the option with the applicable rate.
No, I want to keep my room, and get another one.
That's me.
Waitin' for my wife.
Chigurh. Anton Chigurh. You know how he found you?
Maybe he should be worried. About me.
...You didn't take the product, did you?
The heroin. You don't have it.
Who do you think gets through this gate into the United States of America?
I ask questions. If I get sensible answers then they get to go to America. If I don't get sensible answers they don't. Is there anything about that that you don't understand?
Are you in the service?
Nam?
...I meant your food.
I thought you said the eggs weren't...
Why you always gotta embarrass me? I been eating lunch with you since grade school and you always gotta embarrass me!
...plenty
You need to get yourself gone from my crime scene. And leave Betty alone, she's...
So, you think you're gonna find his scalp hanging in some tepee?
Bad idea...
I questioned Joyce about all this...
Oh, you're sharp as a tack, Elden.
Oww, the arm, the arm!
That's bullshit, Sheriff! You think she's a suspect!
What the hell do you want?... Hey, Sue Ann, what's up?
I see you're sticking to the diet Betty put you on...
Oww... Did you have to make these things so tight?
Any idea where it is?
We need ammo... Go check his jacket, I'll cover you.
Uhh, no, we haven't picked a date yet... well, once he dumps her we will.  He's out pricing banners... I don't expect him back.
I dunno. Job satisfaction, I guess...  How's things at the Tip Top?
So you weren't involved with him in his pathetic attempt to diversify?  Were you mixed up in the drugs, Betty?
I wrote that when I was twelve... where'd you get that?!
I thought you were a garbageman of humanity, or something.
If we went out that window right now we'd have a chance...
Did... did you really come here because you love this guy?
Well, I certainly would have heard about that.
You can start tomorrow. And don't say a word about this to anyone.  Is that issue?
The LeSabre!
Oh, I wish we could just get in it and drive, and drive, and drive!
Sorry, hon. Happy Birthday...
Something bad happened to Del and me, didn't it?
...of course you do.  You don't remember me?
I tried to tell myself it was for the best, that there was a reason behind it. But... Del?
I guess we all did.  You know, I didn't marry Leslie because I loved her. I married her to forget you...
Yeah, I felt that way, too, when I first started, but now... the hours, the repetition... it's not all glamour and mall openings anymore. Maybe I should've listened to my people and tried to make the crossover to nights earlier, I don't know...  ...I just hope it's not too late for me. God! Listen to me, "Me, me, me." It's so easy to get caught up in the whole ego cycle of this business and make it all about yourself. Stop, right? That's it, no more about me tonight, I promise... Let's talk about you... what do you think about me? I'm kidding... Seriously, Betty, I'm doing all the talking here...
Thanks. But I'd like to hear what you're feeling...
Why are you doing this to me?
Oh. Of course... sorry.
Right... I was. I was an idiot, plain and simple, and I hope you can find it in your heart to forgive me. How's that?
I took the blue Corsica, Del. Relax.
...like the water purifiers?
Hey, the FDA screwed me on that when they changed the law, and you know it!  Anyway, 'least I try shit, still got some dreams left... you're a goddamn waitress, what do you got?
It's people with no lives watching other people's fake lives.
Oh, nothing, it's fine. I just need to keep it wrapped for a few...
What're you doing here, Roy?
You're in serious danger!
What's the matter here?
Where you headed, Betty?
I should call you Dorothy.  When I left here I went straight to Italy. Everybody told me not to go. But I wanted to go to Rome ever since I saw Audrey Hepburn in "Roman Holiday," and goddamnit, I went.
I left my husband two days ago.
Oh. I mean, except for that.  Yep. I'm trading in a car dealer for a heart specialist, so that's pretty good...
What are you doing?
You know, the more I think about it, this really isn't David's kind of place.
Had. She died in a car accident last year. She was decapitated.
It may not have been an accident. They never did find her head...
Hey, how 'bout a card for me? What is that?  "Please call if you have any information on David Ravell." This is my phone number! How many of these have you given out?
Jesus! They're all gonna be calling me!
I'M TALKING ABOUT DAVID RAVELL!!
So what do you say? Can we be friends?
Was it a huge place? With a view of the whole world?
You should have a little faith in people.
What are you doing?
Blake, I can handle that transplant!
I'm not some snot-nosed resident fresh out of medical school, Blake.
That won't be necessary. She's staying with a Rosa something... Hernandez, Herrera. I know it's an 'H' sound... in Silverlake.
More than you know. Is there anything else?
If you ate at the Tip Top you did.
I like this. I like doing business in the home. It's cozy...  Who's birthday?
Could you give us an example?
I didn't think so. So, give me an example of a stupid person doing a stupid thing. Not being stupid, you're equipped to recognize it.
Like what?
Well, my idea of stupid is very different from yours.  So here's how this is gonna work. Would you take your socks off, please?
That is so right.
It's not here. Let's go.
Let me tell you something. In our business you can't put food on the table if your phone doesn't ring. The guys who get the calls are good -- not flashy, just good. They get in, they get out. Nobody knows a goddamn thing. Understand? Boom, boom, boom. Three in the head and you know they're dead.
Mmmm. Well, it was a piece of luck running into you, Duane. I thought I was gonna have to take Wesley out and hose him down. All he talks about is those Japanese gals.
Del's dead, by the way. I sent him to the Great Beyond.
Maybe you don't appreciate the gravity of this situation. It's bad enough that we don't have what we came here for. It's worse that we don't know where it is. And now this.  This was supposed to be my last job. I already put the deposit down on my boat.  How can you eat at a time like this? I get nauseous just watching you...
No, I see Betty as a Midwestern Stoic type. Ice water in her veins. A clear thinker. Probably a Swede or a Finn.
Oh, for Chrissakes. It just means the kind of person who can eat shit for a long time without complaining, then cut their momma's throat and go dancing the same night.
That's good. You're learning. But let me tell you why I know she was lying.  First off, Betty would never fall for a soap star. It's beneath her.
...crazy! No shit, Shaft!! And you ain't far behind...
Not her mouth...  I've spent many long hours in a car with your face staring back at me. I've seen it painted on the horizon.
...and how long did she work here?
I see.  May I?
Isn't that the point?
Seems like a nice place.
Funny, that's just what I was thinking...
Hmm?
Is there a problem, George?
Damn, that's sweet...  She really that good-looking in person?
You're wastin' your time, Roy.
Nothin' complex about it. Del's dead, Betty's gone. She's probably dead, too.
No... before that.
I don't know what you think you'll find, anyway.
What did you say?
Goddamn... how 'bout Jasmine?
I see.  Did Chloe testify?
Oh, umm, yes, this is Dwight Campbell.
I flatter myself that such is the case; in my line of work it's plumb necessary. The one thing you don't want is air in the conversation.
Why don't we bed down out here tonight?
We didn't abandon you, Pete, we just thought you was a toad.
How'd he know about the treasure?
What do we do now, Everett?
Five... hunnert... thousand... each.
Damn! We gotta skedaddle!
What on earth is goin' on here! What's got into you, Delmar!
I guess Vernon T. Waldrip is gonna be goin' on relief. Maybe I'll be able to throw a little patronage his way, get the man a job diggin' ditches or rounding up stray dogs.
You don't know where his goddamn folks from; you speakin' outcha asshole.
Have him join us, run our campaign 'stead a that pencil-neck's.
I can and I am and I will - tomorrow! I gotta think about the little Wharvey gals! They look to me for answers! Vernon can s'port 'em and buy 'em lessons on the clarinet! The only good thing you ever did for the gals was get his by that train!
...Time for this old boy to enjoy some repose.
Pete's cousin turned us in for the bounty!
Huh?! They dam that river on the 21st.  Today's the 17th!
Hell, at least it woulda washed away the stink of that pomade.
An' all my meals for free...
Me? Oh, I didn't have no plan. Still don't, really.
Itta Bena, now, uh, that would be...
They lured me out for a bathe, then they dunked me'n trussed me up like a hog and turned me in for the bounty.
But...
Well, it's a invitation-only affair; we'll have to sneak in through the service entrance-
Two weeks! That don't do me no good!
Hold on there - I don't want this pomade, I want Dapper Dan.
Hot damn, boy, I almost believe you did sell your soul to the devil!
Soggy Bottom Boys - I don't precisely recollect, uh -
Daddy!
It's bona fide!
How was the flight? They take care of you okay? Long way from Norfolk, isn't it?
This is it. This is where I live. I suppose you could bunk over there and you could go to school at the base.
Don't be pissed. I'm on your side, Pard. I just don't want you to do something you'll regret. You gotta give six years to the Navy if you wanna fly... that's six years with the most uptight assholes God put on this earth. Officers aren't like you and me, man. It's another breed.
Fuck, no! Why would I care about something as dumb as that?
She said you told her in every letter how much you loved her, how you wanted to marry her, have children with her...
Zack, we've got to go.
He doesn't mean anything by it, Zack. Do you, Joe?
Where'd you get this, Mayo? This is really wonder work.
I want your D.O.R.
No, sir!
What're you waiting for, Mayo? Get your scuzzy ass up here.
Where are you from, boy?
Uh-uh! Not a chance! There's nobody in this town doing anything with his life, except what his father did, which is nothing. If I can't have more out of life than that, I'd rather be dead!
Yes I do!
Is this you boys first night of liberty since you got here?
Sid Worley, I think you're ashamed of me.
What other issue is there, Sid?
But... but what would we do? Where would we go?
I'm not pregnant. I got my period this morning. There's no baby, Sid.
Hurry, Lynette. It's almost midnight.
How did it go with you guys?
You serious about having him over?
Paula, how far would you go to catch Zack?
You know what I mean. Would you... let yourself get pregnant?
I never used to think I'd do something like that, but now I'm not so sure. You ask me, nine weeks just ain't long enough to get a guy to fall in love with you.
What did you tell him about the baby?
I hear most of the girls who come to these things are looking for a husband.
Do you go to school?
Zack, I dare you not to fall in love with me. I ain't gonna get serious with you, no way. But how can you resist me? I'm like candy.
So, after you graduate you go on to basic flight, right? Is that in Pensacola?
Some day. When I'm sure I can do a better job of it than my folks.
Because my real father wouldn't marry her.
Sure.  Zack, I hope you know I didn't have to show you that picture.
I'm not a Puget Deb. I hate that goddamn term!
Two bucks a buckle, Perryman. Look at that shine! Boonies'll cost you five.
Hey, man, is the piss-ass money you're making off this worth the risk of getting us all kicked out of here on an honor violation?
Jets.
Hey, you gonna tell anybody about this?
Hey, you guys still awake?
What's the matter, Sweet Pea. Foley finally starting to get to you?
I don't believe that. They're just having a good time, same as us.
She's the sweetest person I've ever known. Loves kids. Works with handicapped kids every afternoon at the church. Everybody loves her.
Sid, what happened?
You're welcome.
What the fuck is funny about this?
Stop it!  Stop it!
Th --
Are you okay?
You're wasting your fucking time, man, you're wasting my time.  You don't know how to do this, and the longer we stay in here, the more likely she's gonna lose it and call the cops!
That's your problem.
Let me fucking finish this so we can get out of here.
They're not supposed to be here!
Who is this guy?
Asshole.
It's still a good plan.  It's just... got a twist.
When you said you'd let 'em go I thought she'd come running right out for sure.
Yes.  Yes, it's all terrible ironic and amusing.  You fuck.  Now how are you gonna get us into that room?
Nobody is gonna die, man, will you please have the balls to follow through with a good idea?  Think about it, what would you do if you were them, stay in there and choke to death, or come out?!  Huh?  We're just getting them to come out for forty-five minutes, forty-five fucking minutes!  The worst that's gonna happen is they pass out, we drag 'em out here into the fresh air, and they'll be fine.
Oh, I've seen these...
That's highly inappropriate.
Push that button for me, will you?
Cut it back a little bit.
"Half?"  What did you, take a nap in math class?  Three people, three shares, one third.  Four point six six six repeating.
No, you will not, because without Burnham there's no way in hell we're gonna get into that safe, so as far as I'm concerned he can paint your ass blue and run it up a flagpole and you won't lay a finger on him, you understand me?
We're leaving.
Makes me nervous.
No, Edgar Allen.
The phone works.  Hey, I hooked up the phone.
What if they get in here?
We're not coming out.  We're not letting you in.  Get out of my house. 
We're never getting out of here.
If it looks like I can't get back, just close the door.
Strip 'em, expose the ends, try blue first, blue is phones!
He'll know we're in trouble.  He heard me, I said "There are three..."
He's just across the park, this is why we got places so close to each other, in case we needed each other, we're still a family, he'll help us...
Why?
What if I spazz out?
Where is the Glucogen?
Tyrone...
Okay now, er, Huey, so what's your telephone number?
Well... is it loaded?
What? We're the leadership, you and me. There ain't enough of us to...
You got to sit on Eldridge...
...The police report says he was shot three times but the coroner's report says quite clearly that Denzil Dowell was shot six times. And two of those shots were in his armpits. Brothers and Sisters you know why that is?  Because Denzil had his hands up!!
Yeah... Sounds like the Constitution to me. With a little of the Bill of Rights thrown in...
Like?
Get out of the car.
I can't... they don't operate that way...
PE? What? You guys doing gym class?
Cy... Cy... Oh shit man... who did this to you. Was it the pigs?
Rodgers... this is no good...
Yes sir I was.
Shit, nothing but Paper Panthers.
Yeah man, but where's Judge?
That's right. We'd be proud to provide as escort for Malcolm's widow. How many men you got?
What it be Judge. Nobody got hurt, Sister Betty's safe. This was a good day...
I do. You think you're smart enough to keep playing the game?
Man, this shit's pretty thick.
Listen Judge, Oakland's Panther International Headquarters. We shut the Pig's infiltration down here, they're gonna think twice about running their games on other chapters.
Yeah well, they want a lot for their money. They want a felony, preferably with "violent intent." We've got to give them something. They'll kill me if I don't. And the Panthers are going to kill me if I do. I'm scared.
Yeah, I do.
Fuck is up?!
Motherfuckers...
This cool the heat off you any?
Judge... I... I shoulda told you this before but... well... fuck...
Ain't no one seen him.
Yeah.
I hear them boys, those Black Panthers, they're communists. They don't even believe in God.
Maybe we'll be lucky this winter and have just rain, no snow.
He reminds me of you before you got old and ugly.
They're from good stock on their mother's side.
I know that.
You're surrendering.
Please forgive me for keeping you waiting.
I served in His Majesty's army in the French and Indian War.
You are familiar with how these things are done.  In fact, I would like to claim aggrieved status.
I do have eighteen criminals under sentence of death, but I hold no prisoners-of-war.
My harrier.  Join us, Colonel.
What news?
We'd cover more ground if we split up.
You learned her lessons better than I.
She spoke?  Susan spoke?
Sir, I'd like to request a furlough. Two days?
That's not enough.  Tell me.
A long time ago...
You were an Englishman then...
I'll see to it that he serves under me.
Where is he now?
We're a breath away from losing this war.  In the North, Washington is reeling from Valley Forge, running and hiding from Clinton and twelve thousand Redcoats.  Here in the South, Cornwallis has broken our back.  He captured over five thousand of our troops when he took Charleston and today he destroyed the only army that stood between him and New York.
Fall, six months at the earliest.
They'd be better off, but the cause wouldn't be.
His wife was killed yesterday.  She was with child.
It is ended.
And congratulations on the birth of your son.
Lord Cornwallis will be with you presently.
You may, of course, keep your weapons, but I must warn you that...
Yes, quite, but you should know that...
For trying to impose some decency on that sort.
Seventeen.
Put those away.
Who might you be, little Miss?
What if you can't read what's written on there anymore?
Ellie...God doesn't do things like that. I know you loved y'brother, but--
I want to fly it! Can I fly it now, mommy!
No-I guess not.
And that someone cared enough about that animal to mark the spot.
In the end he's gonna croak, isn't he?
Is he really all right?
I've noticed it, too. I'll cough up the money, Ellen.
No--but if he drops by, I'll tell him to call you.
Hey--they actually found the place!
God, that's fine.
What?
Nice.
Loved that cat pretty well, didn't she?
What do you mean?
Micmacs used to call it Little God Swamp.
The Micmac Indians. I brought you here to bury Ellen's cat.
Doesn't look like they last long.
Ayuh...how is your cat, Louis?
Please, I want to wake up. Leave me alone. It's not my fault you died; you were as good as dead when they brought you in--
I'll tell you where the ground is sour--the ground in my heart is sour. Let me tell you something else, Vic-baby: Wrong is wrong.
You stole my boat.
We got that part.  Anything else?
That's your offer?  You, sailing away nice and pretty with the Black Pearl, and all I have is a name?
There's ... another exit?
Now?
Looks like your back to having nothing to offer.
That's proper, sir, according to the code.
I'll drop it!
Do you not know what this is, then?
I think it would be rather exciting to meet a pirate.
I apologize if I seem forward -- but I must speak my mind.  This promotion confirms that I have accomplished the goals I set for myself in my career.  But it also casts into sharp relief that which I have not achieved.  The thing all men most require: a marriage to a fine woman.  You have become a fine woman, Elizabeth.
Actually, I find it all fascinating.
It's -- beautiful. May I inquire as to the occasion?
You'll be dining with the Captain, and he requests you wear this.
You?!
Captain Sparrow!  We have to get off this island -- immediately!
So that's it?  That's the secret grand adventure of the infamous Jack Sparrow?  You spent three days on the beach drinking rum?
You should look at our contretemps this way: we've got shade trees, thank the Lord.  We've got some food on the trees, thank the Lord again.  And we've got rum, praise the Lord.  We can stay alive a month, maybe more.  Keep a weather eye open for passing ships, and our chances are fair.
That was before I met one, of course.
A fool's errand.
We'd best drop canvas, sir!
How did you get off the island?
It's a signal.  If we resist, it won't just be death.  There'll be torture as well.
We can at least fight -- we might be able to kill a few--
All the men in place, sir.  Ready to fire.
What's your name?
Well, well... Jack Sparrow, isn't it?
I don't like the situation, Mister Sparrow.  The island is riddled with caves.  I will not put my men at a disadvantage.
That chart I drew up'll get you past the reefs.  If you're steersman's good enough, that is.
Do you think this is wise, boy? Crossing blades with a pirate?
You cheated.
Move!
Are you familiar with that ship? The Black Pearl?
Where does it make berth?
Because you're a pirate.
I'd die for her.
This is either crazy, or brilliant.
Everybody stay calm.  We're taking over the ship!
I swear, you look just like him.
You think your father is the only man who ever lived the Glasgow life, telling folk one thing, and then going off to do another? There's quite a few who come here, hoping to amass enough swag to ease the burdens of respectable life. And they're all 'merchant marines.'
Wait -- what about the pistol?
What's that?
Miss Swann!  We're here to rescue you!  It's going badly!
You haven't seen it.
No.
But --
Dr. Bright, I don't have to do anything.
I can explain it.  Attempted murder wasn't enough for him.  He wants to add kidnapping to the charges.
Like rotting meat.
Oh no?  Smell this.
She says it's not.
She did not.  The mouse ran down the drain.
And you think O'Brien is that leverage?
You know how I feel about you.  You know how much I need you.  How much I trust you.  I would do anything for you.
Then you still love me?
It will be an ascension.
I was wondering if you'd finished considering?
Dr. Makeo is working on it now, sir. I estimate at least another six hours.
Yeah, I do!
Haw-haw!  Why don't you run off and find a cop and I'll wait right here.
I just want to know what goes on in the mind of a litterbug.  What chemical is secreted by your smooth brain that tells you, 'It's okay, just chuck it'?
They also tried using viral R.N.A. as the bonding element.
What did security say?
Of course, sir.
I don't believe this is happening...
Yes?
You want to tell me what I'm looking for?
He's probably right, sir, the building is probably going to collapse under its own weight.
When did you...?
Really?  What have you been doing?
Do you ever wonder what happened to us, Susie?
Nothing really worthwhile.
We'll see?  What does that mean?
I'm sorry I brought the whole thing up!  If you're gonna flip your wig --
Why?
To put is simply, the nanobot inside you is a microscopic machine encoded with information like a strand of messenger R.N.A. that is programmed to synthesize your molecules with the polyisoprenes of the assembler fluid, rebuilding your entire organic system on a molecular level.
What do these replicators do to people?
So right now there's little replicators spreading throughout Argon's lab?
I think while we're waiting, we had better run some basic diagnostics on you.
Oh yeah, real funny.  Yuk-yuk. Let's laugh at everything a man believes in.
What's that supposed to mean?
I feel very emotional right now.  A bit out of control.
What's wrong?
I could go with you.
No cheese.
You made this out of my hair?
Did you go?
I don't believe it.  You're here! Oh thank God.
I didn't know what was going to happen.  I was just so worried something was going to happen to you.
Run, Daniel!  Get out of here!
That means the nanobot is still inside him.
You're not going after Argon!
God, when we were in that store all I could think about was that one time, when we were in school, and you attacked that little kid who wanted some cereal.  Do you remember that?
God, what a fight that was.
Yeah, I have something I've been meaning to give you.
I could have you fired right now.
It might be paranoia, but I've never lost my keycard before.
Miss Wilson will give you the guest list and any other details you may need, Miss Gallagher.
I'm sure you're quite willing to be decent about this.
May I use your telephone?
That's considerate of you.
Will - uh - five thousand be enough?
won't even pretend it isn't a very great favor. I wish there was something I could do for you
Really?
Don't you think it's silly of us to think of living there when we have this whole big house
Oh, Mother will give us the blue room. You haven't a red room, have you?  Well, bless her heart. Wouldn't that be nice! My, oh my - six rooms and two baths and a blue room. I guess she would let us have the right wing if we needed it, wouldn't she?
What do you think my friends would say if they found me in a little cheap flat?
I've got a present. Shut your eyes. Keep 'em closed. I know you're going to love them.
Oh, yes you will my dear - oh, yes you will my dear - you'll eat spinach but you'll wear garters too!
Think of the fun we can have - we'll sneak down the back stairs and get in the valet's Ford. How's that?
I'll tell you what let's do - I'll take you and introduce you to all my gang. Would you like that?
This is something I should have done a long time ago, only I didn't have sense enough to do it. No, I had to stick around here to try and make a success of something that I knew darn well was a failure from the very beginning. But no more. No more! So that's that.
You've done nothing but watch me - watch me! - ever since I've been here. Treated me like a thug, watched me like a hawk, mistrusted me. Every time I leave the house, that Jane  goes out and counts the silverware.
What's the matter? Isn't there a 'bless you' in the crowd?
I got him his job on the paper. I'm a stock-holder, you know.
Give my regards to your managing editor.
Would you like to have me turn around for you, Bingy?
Yeah.
Aagh! No wonder you're batty. Would it be imposing too much upon you if I asked you to do a little work today? Just to sort of break the monotony?
Yeah, little Gloria.
Yeah - and get us into a million dollar libel suit. It wouldn't be the first time. Now, you get over there and get a statement out of the old lady, the sister, or the kid. Any of them - but get it.
Not on my own beat, no.
What do I care about your mother- in-law! You're still working for this paper, aren't you! Or are you?
Gallagher and myself just came over here to do a little work on a story -
Just a boid in a gilded cage -
What play?
The one about the Siberian bloodhound?
Well, I'm sorry to see a good reporter go blooey  Let me know when you're quitting.
Who are you?
Are you trying to tell me that I need someone to help me put on my pants and button them up?
All right, outside!
That's a canary, sir.
Yes, sir. Very good, sir.
The boss is getting hoarse.
Sure, sure. You've got a nose, Gallagher. You've got a nose. But there's different women, Gallagher. You know, like brewery horses and thoroughbreds.
There you go, talking like a woman!
Well, well, well! Gallagher, old pal! There you are. What did you run away for?
Sure, you ran away. Aren't you going to congratulate a guy?
Thanks, thanks.
Do you think your wife would walk up three flights of stairs just to eat out of paper plates?
My error.
Don't pay attention to him, Stew. He doesn't know what he's talking about.
Sure - I think so, Stew.
How is her family going to feel about it?
Gee Gallagher, do you look good! What are you doing to yourself?
I'm sorry, Stew. I asked Hank, and Hank did the rest.
Stewart, have you ever been to Old Madrid?
Thanks. May I sit down?
Fine, but kinda thirsty.
What is it, Smythe?
As a matter of fact, I was just trying to decide the color of Anne's eyes. I can't tell whether they're blue, or whether they're violet. What would you say, Mrs. Schuyler?
Indeed? Perhaps he will do me a great favor.
Good morning, everybody  Well, maybe it isn't a good morning, huh?  Anne, did you ever get the feeling that there was someone else in the room with you?
Yes - the worm!
And you struck him right here in our house?
Heavens! The man's insane!
But I
No, that's enough. I just wanted you to get the idea. Now you know. This house is haunted.
Found no skeletons?
Smythe, what do you do with yourself - I mean, when you're not carrying those double-strength - what do you do with yourself?
Hmmm, you just putter. Do you have to have a putter to putter?
You sir? Uh-uh. You could never be a putterer. Not a good putterer, sir.
It isn't done, gentlemen! It isn't done, I say! It isn't done!
Mary Sue?
What goes on up at Lover's Lane?
Bud. Mary Sue ... Breakfast is on the table.
Bu-ud ... Mary Sue ... Your breakfast is getting cold.
Have you got any make up?
And they won't be able to tell?
I just thought ... It's beautiful.
It's alright. Let me see.
You can't go out there.
Sounds nice ... Once you get used to it.
Like a drum.
Sure you are.
Look at me George. That meeting's not for me. Look at my face.
It goes away ... It'll go away.
I don't know if I ever said this to you before, but, well ... I think you're just about the keenest girl in the whole school ...
Oh yeah.
I mean, there's kids that are even holding hands already but I figure there's plenty of time for that kind of thing later on. Don't you?
To be honest Mary Sue. I didn't think you'd want to come here until we'd been pinned for a little while.
It's six-thirty ...
I'm busy.
I don't believe it.
And it's important for them to see someone they respect, stand up for what's right. If you love a place, you can't sit around and watch this kind of thing happen to it.
And that's why I want you to be on the Pleasantville Chamber of Commerce.
Do you know that it's illegal?
Good. Do you further admit that this unnatural depiction occurred in full public view where it was accessible to, and in plain sight of, minor children?
THIS BEHAVIOR WILL STOP AT ONCE.
It's not in ME.
How'd you know about the fire?
And where's that?
What's outside of Pleasantville?
Hear your Dad got a new car.
No, not that hedge. The other one.
Do you mind. This is like the most important moment of my whole life.
God, David. Just give it to me!
What did you do?
Oh God.
I still don't see why we're doing this.
Okay, now you listen to me! I don't know what's going on but you'd better fix it! I had a date with Mark Davis and I even bought new UNDERWEAR!
Play along?
Jen, listen ...
I could like kill a guy with these things.
What do you mean?
Couple of cheeseburgers and two cherry cokes.  If you need anything, I'll be right over there.
They're happy like this.
I mean, you don't think it's just like dorky or funny or something ... you really like it.  Oh God! I am just so personally horrified right now ...
What's wrong?
You're reading?
Seemed kinda sexy. Look. I read 35 pages.
And you're sure about this?
I baked you my oatmeal cookies.
Keeps going ...
Where are they?
Okay, whose window did Bud break when he was playing with his father's golf clubs?
Say--why don't you take this remote instead. It's got a little more "Ooomph" in it.
Look--we appreciate it. We really do. We just--we want to go home now.
Don't get upset.
Like when Margaret Henderson makes her cookies for Whitey.  ... Those aren't your cookies Bud.
Excuse me?
BUD.
I had nothing to do with that.
Look. I thought we talked about this, I thought we said ...
Well ... I'm not sure I see the point anymore.
No I know ... I know I do ...  But it's always the same, you know? Grill the bun, flip the meat, melt the cheese ... It never changes. It never gets any better or worse ...
What's wrong?
It's okay. We'll get you a new one.
It's beautiful.
You think you could do this like soon? It's almost six thirty.
Well, I can't talk though --
Do you realize that the monetary value of this promotion and the prize is potentially worth more than the purchases?
Yes, indeed, yes I am.
Oh yeah no I don't want to do that.
Yeah, but please don't do that.
I know.
Hey....I was just telling everyone about how I was gonna bring this girl for you but you wouldn't let me do it.
You're lucky. She couldn't come anyway --
Hey, what are you doing? Why are you wearing a suit again?
Seriously, though: We're going to eat, I said.
-- do you think you'll ask her out?
Did you ask Walter to get you a shrink?  Barry, did you ask Walter to get you a shrink? What's wrong with you? Are you ok?
What's all this pudding?
Why's it here?
Goodbye.
Where are you?
No.
....no....
No.
It doesn't matter.
I'm horny, Jack, what about you?
Does Jack like to Jack Off?
...yeah....well you have me now.
Thank you. What do you do, Barry?
I'm fine. Who is this?
Hi....what....what's up....?
So you think you can?
Hello?
You lied to me?
Hello?
They're not open yet?
Do you know them.
Oh My God.
That's great -- Hawaii. I was thinking about going there.
It was great to meet you again. To see you again, thanks for helping me yesterday --
I'm going to go and eat tomorrow night do you want to go with me?
Do you want to pick me up?
That's nice. It's nice.  I've been looking around a lot lately at promotional giveaways, cross promotional work by some companies. Do you remember all that pudding?
So that pudding was bought, I bought that pudding because of a pretty interesting promotion that's sponsored by Healthy Choice and American Airlines. It's designed to encourage airline travel and obviously designed to encourage buying Healthy Choice products. They make frozen meals, deli meats, pasta sauce, breads, soups and ice creams, this sort of thing.....
My friend Carlos is doing it who works with me. It's his. It's his pudding, he's doing it. It's not mine. He's crazy. I told him not to do it. He's the one who's insane. He only spent about one hundred dollars so far though --
It was nice to see you again, to see your face again, to go out with you --
Yeah, I don't know, we'll see about that.
Really?
I'll see you later.
I don't, no matter what my sisters say, ok?
Hello?
Ok. So you were married for how long?
Do you wanna have sex?
I forgot about that.
Yes I'm sorry.
Ok.
Ok...because of the time difference if you needed to call me early?
Yeah.
No.
The police are on their way.
-- it's $2.99 per minute for the first half hour and $1.99 per minute after that.
And your name?
It's ok, take your time.
I'll say whatever I want --
Sorry about that.
How you doin' Barry?
How's business?
Yeah.
I had this whole thing in my head, I was gonna be able to get this to you today -- I have to leave today --
Good morning, Barry....
Which guy in Toledo are you talking about?
You talkin' to me about Ramada Inn?
Ok. Well. I'm gonna go out of town. I'm going to go out of town just for two days...
Yes.
HEY. You made a fucking sex call and now you're gonna pay. It's not a big thing -- just give us some money and then it's over -- we'll just walk down to the ATM and get your money out --
Yes. Sorry.
Your expenses are your own.
...keys for the track. You have to gas it up and save the receipts on that. His address. We have a business address too if you need that -- but hit him at his house first, see what this little bad boy is all about and shake him up -- give him a little doe-see-doe --
Yeah.
I can't find that thing in my car, I can't find it so I'll just get it and give it to you later. So?
You wouldn't want to go out with him anyway, honestly, he's such a freak sometimes.
-- and the listless ones do the binding.
I don't believe it. The Marquis de Sade? You're actually publishing his novels?
Marquis? Is that you?
Yes, well, I awoke to discover I'd turned into a cat. If you don't do as I say, I'll sink my little fangs into your drumsticks, and suck the marrow straight out of your bones.
"One day, Fanchon's first client was a surgeon. He ran his fingers across her naked skin, pulling apart folds of flesh, inspecting each and every follicle..."
Charenton has changed; it's not safe for you here.
I should've told you it was the blood of Christ; you'd believe that, wouldn't you?
Yes! It is! The paper's cheap, the type's too small --
You've a touch of the poet, too; perhaps you should take up the quill.
You mean to take us all down with you?
Perhaps -- in time -- you'll earn them back through good behavior --
Start with the Bible; it's cheerier, and more artfully written.
Madeleine. She's besotted with me; she'd do anything I ask. She could pay you a midnight visit --
My bed, gone! Am I to freeze to death?
WHY THIS SUDDEN TORTURE?
You expect me to pimp Madeleine?
IT'S NOT YOUR PROVINCE TO ASK.
I dare you. Stab my flesh. Which one of us will bleed?
Surely you'll grant me a final word.
It's essential to his recovery; a purgative for the toxins in his mind.
Unless we set Charenton on a straight and narrow course, she'll be shut down forever by order of the Emperor.
Well?
And --?
He's more than a patient, Doctor; the Marquis is my friend --
My, my. You have exceeded my expectations.
Here it is; the last chapter.
I'll be waiting.
It's a long story, this one.
The story's thrilling conclusion comes at a premium.
What have they done to you now?
They've taken your clothes?
Doctor... Can I impart to you his cruelest trick?
You've no right to assault me in this fashion; I'll call for my footman. I'll have you removed --
Hm? Tell me. What other treats?
For fuck's sake, woman! BONBONS? I'm to sit here, gorging myself on useless trifles, sucking down your little sweetmeats, when what I truly need -- what I truly require -- are a few quill pens? Perhaps a pot of ink?
To flaunt your deviance in public? Upon a stage?
It's gonna be fine, Orson. You're gonna do great.
We've known each other too long, Orson. Sling the bullshit elsewhere.
That's why he has the parties, he says it's like bringing the world to me.
I did my best but, well, you know me
Thing that bothers me now, though, looking back is that I really think I could have been something ... special.
I see. And you are in California for what reason?
I wonder. Do you have any idea what you have done?
Louis
See what you can do about this CITIZEN KANE picture, won't you?
Goddamn it. I gotta have some kinda life!
It's not really--
Marion--
A million dollars a year on art and st-st-statues and there's nothing to explain?!
I know where Deauville is for C-C-Christ's sake.
Did you need it? Did you need any of it?
Fuck you, Mr. Kane.
The jigsaw puzzles and the, urn, career -- the man spending a fortune to make her a star -- only it's opera and not movies. And...
Why did we not know about this sooner?
I pay you a good deal of money to be my eyes and ears in Hollywood, do I not? If you cannot provide this simple service you are of no use to me.
love them so much that they ought to love you back. Only you want love on your own terms. "
That's right. A symphony of those: vaunted and valued tellers-of-truth. Those heroic minutemen standing sentry on our liberties--
So, we've got to come up with our movie. Our biography.
We find the man and then we dissect him-
Howard Hughes killed Jean Harlow?
The man doesn't allow drinking or cigars? This is monstrous.
Look at those hands. Those are the hands of an artist. A modern Caravaggio.
Here you are, up with the birds for once, you vampire!
This better be good
Oh Christ...
Now remember he's a public figure who sought out that publicity so legally he can't stop us from--
Howard Hughes, he would just kill us. Hearst he would kill us and fuck everything we ever loved.
Sorry to disappoint.
How?
It's 350 pages long.
What?
The title?
And I'm looking at them -- and they're all looking at me and I don't know who should pour the tea. '
Me, I'm proud to be a Jew, I got no problem. You don't like it, fuck you. But with these guys it's like a dirty word. All they wanna be is good red- white-and-blue Americans, and the way they see it you can't be a good American and a Jew. So Sam Goldfish becomes Sam Goldwyn and David Selznick becomes David 0. Selznick -- like anyone's gonna think he's Irish for fuck's sake--
Believe you me, they're gonna do anything -- and I mean absolutely anything -- to stop that word from gettin' out.
They won't let it out. Not Hearst. Not the other studio heads--
Monstro! Ran into Walter Winchell outside He wants to play Herod in the picture. Hiya, George.
Excuse me, I hope this isn't rude, but aren't you Marion Davies?
"Rosebud? I'll tell you about Rosebud.
"Rosebud? I'll tell you about Rosebud.
"Rosebud? I'll tell you about Rosebud."
I know, I know! But what more can you expect of me?! I have pared this story down to the marrow to save money but to cut more would be to--!
Now don't have a fit -- but I want you to think again about doing WAR OF THE WORLDS-
Listen to me. The press ban is killing us and the distributors won't book it. And meantime I'm dealing with the stockholders in New York who are scared shitless -- and I'm this far from getting fired myself -- and you don't have a friend in the world but me right now. So you have got to trust that I'll do what I can to--
For Christ's sake, shut up--
I told you! Where? Grauman's? El Capitan? Or did Radio City come crawling back?
You want to do the life of Jesus?
We're from...
He's an embarrassment because Frankie and the other guys are expectin' me to do something about it, and I'm lookin' very bad. I can't deliver a kid from my own neighborhood. Why's he make it so hard on himself? He comes to me, I can make it easier for him.
What's up, Colonel?
This looks done.
Yeah, I really cleaned up on him.
What's wrong?
Hey, c'mon, what's the matter?
That's what I'm sayin'. You shouldn't even think like that. It's crazy.
Harder.  Take the towel off.
What was that for? I know you can take punches. I can hit you from now to doomsday. What the fuck does that prove?
And that hard-on, Salvy. Who's he think he is? I'm gonna let that fuckin' hard-on come up here and act like a big shot.
I'm tellin' you, she'll be there, I know she'll be there. Dressed up and everything.
Hey, watch your mouth. Don't talk like that. She's still my wife.
He fights the toughest guys around that everybody else is afraid to fight...
Excuse me for a minute. Be right back.
Try talkin' to her. She's your wife -- ask her what's the matter.
I'm gonna order up some stuff. Have a steak.
Well, you're not supposed to kiss your mother on the mouth.
Answer me somethin'. What happened at the Copa with Salvy when I was out of town?
Why didn't you tell me about it?
What do you mean, "you"?
I don't mean now. I mean before -- before we met.
Was Vickie part of the deal with Tommy? Was my wife part of the deal? Tell me, was that it?
Why not? There's nobody else around who wants to fight me; they're all afraid. I don't see why I shouldn't have a shot at the title right now.
Yeah. At night.
I'll give you anything you want, Jake. I think you should come out for a few minutes -- give yourself a break.
He ain't hurting me, but I can't get him down.
I ain't no movie star. I'm just in high school.
You go first. Let me watch how to do this.
Jake, this is your father's bedroom.
Jake...
Take off my pants.
I was just...
What're you lookin' at? You lookin' at him?
You asleep?
But Jake... I didn't say anything...
I went out.
Where you been all day?
What'd you see?
Answer me when I talk to you. What happened that night?
I didn't do anything wrong. I swear. I just had a few drinks.
I'm sorry. I had to work late last night. Slept at the club.
Sure, what else is new?
Aw, c'mon. Don't say that.
Tony Janiro's gotta watch out, eh?
Salvy, would I steer you wrong? Let's say that's the truck; it's full of cigarettes, right? Now, two o'clock this morning we move the truck from here to there,  take the cigarettes out, sell 'em, make some cash.
I'm not gonna tell him nothing; but if he finds out, he will kill you. What's the matter with you? Aren't you happy? You got everything you want.
Does he have your number, Mr. Jefferies?
I would say that is looked as if she wasn't coming back.
You've got a lot to lean about homicide, Jeff. Morons have committed murder so shrewdly that it took a hundred trained police minds to catch them. That salesman wouldn't just knock off his wife after dinner, toss her in a trunk and put her in storage.
She never left the apartment --
-- until yesterday morning.
I think that's about the time I fell asleep.
Who said they left then?
If possible -- both.
I can't do that.
You know, every day for three years I asked myself that same question?
Like Mrs. Thorwald's wedding ring. If that woman were still alive, she'd be wearing it.
For what?
This is Wednesday.
Swell. I get myself half-killed for you -- and you reward me by stealing my assignments.
Okay. Indo-China. Tuesday. We'll pick you up.
Well -- did you get it, Thorwald?
Now stop wasting time, Thorwald, or I'll hang up and call the police.
Readers' Digest, April, 1939.
I predicted it.
How can you tell that from a thermometer!
That's abnormal.
The insurance Company would be a lot happier if you slept in your bed, not the wheelchair.
Eyes bloodshot. Must have been staring out the window for hours.
He and his wife splitting up?
His personal effects. He's probably running away -- the coward.
What about this morning? Any developments?
A Federal offense.
I'm just going to get the name of their truck!
There's a dip at this end. And since when do flowers grow shorter in two weeks?
I wonder.
Miss Lonely Hearts just laid out something that looks like sodium trieckonal capsules.
Ten here.
Not yet, Jeff.
It is something really important, Jeff?
How's your leg?
That dress should be listed on the stock exchange.
It's opening night of the last depressing week of L. B. Jefferies in a cast.
Now that's no way to spend your hard- earned money!
Make the one you want.
Don't laugh. -- I could do it!
Oh? You can see my apartment all the way up on 63rd street?
Did you ever eat fish heads and rice?
I'm not exactly on the other side of the room.
Don't you ever have any problems?
So do I.
Why would a man leave his apartment three times, on a rainy night, with a suitcase? And come back three times?
What's interesting about a butcher's knife and a small saw wrapped up in a newspaper?
Sitting around, looking out a window to kill time, is one thing -- but doing it the way you are --  -- with, with binoculars, and with wild opinions about every little movement you see -- is, is diseased!
I don't know what you consider it -- but if you don't stop it, I'm getting out of here.
What makes you think something's wrong with her?
The name on the second floor rear mailbox reads Mr. And Mrs. Lars, that's L-A-R-S, Lars Thorwald.
He had it hidden in the dresser! Well, at least it was in there. He took it out, went to the phone and called somebody long distance. -- His wife's jewelry was in the handbag. And something about it worried him. He was asking somebody advice over the phone.
And you, and you friend Doyle --  Did you hear from him again -- since he left?
What doesn't?
They do not! And they don't leave it behind them. A woman going anywhere but the hospital would always take makeup, perfume and jewelry.
From his landlord -- once a month.
Surprise -- is the most important element of attack.  And beside, you're not up on your private eye literature. When they're in trouble, it's always their Girl Friday who gets them out of it.
The same.
Jeff, if you're squeamish, just don't look.
What for?
Shut up. I'm all right.
Friend of yours?
Meaning me?
Machismo?
What you say your name was?
Buzz Gundersen.
This is the edge, boy.  This is the end.
Any other entrance?
What's he going to pull--
What time is it?
Tell him why we moved here.
You can't protect me.
You thought I was Mom?
Suppose you knew that you had to do something very dangerous--where you have to prove something you need to know--a question of honor.  Would you do it?
Ten years?  Now, Dad--I need an answer now!
Go ahead.
You're absolutely right!
You know you did wrong.  That's the main thing, isn't it?
Whoa!  Whoa!  I know you're a little upset but--
You sure?
I was talking to Jim.
I guess when I nearly died giving birth to you--that shows how much I don't care!
Look Jim.  Far be it from me to tell you what to do, but there's--
She keep it to protect herself, sir. She scared without a man in the house.
Can you tell me why you killed the puppies, Plato?
You scared?
He has a knife.
No.  It's perpetual motion.
I'm here.
Who has?
It's me!
They're looking for you!--
We're safe here.  I hope.  What do you think?
What?
We'll take it!
Let's see how long we can stay under.
Haven't you noticed your personality splitting?
I came here before.
Mom and Dad.  I used to be in my crib and I'd listen to them fight.
That's swell.  How are you?
In your pocket.  Give it to me.
Who's that?
What?
I'm sorry.
What happened, darling.  We were so worried.  I was going to take a sleeping pill, but I wouldn't till I knew you were home.
Do you enjoy doing this to me or what--
What about the other boys--Do you think they'll go to the police?
They think I'll make friends if we move.  Just move and everything'll be roses and sunshine.
Boy--if I had one day when I didn't have to be all confused and ashamed of everything--or I felt I belonged some place.
Okay--
You don't have to be unfriendly.
"Life can be beautiful." Hey, I know where it was.
Yeah--why--
Yeah.  So where's the high school?
I'll bet you're a real yo yo.
Like even today.  I woke up this morning, you know?  And the sun was shining and everything was nice. Then the first thing that happens is I see you and I thought this is going to be one terrific day so you better live it up, boy, 'cause tomorrow maybe you'll be nothing.
Why did you do that?
Where can we go?  I can't go back into that zoo.
Why don't we just rent it for the season?
Well--we're newlyweds.
You can't talk underwater!
Maybe he's scared of the dark.
There's something I should tell you, Judy.
Is this what it's like to love somebody?
I love somebody.  All the time I've been looking for someone to love me and now--I love somebody.  And it's so easy.  Why is it easy now?
You should have heard him talk about you tonight.  Like you were the hero in the China Seas.
Is he your friend?
Children?  Well, we really don't encourage them.  They're so noisy and troublesome, don't you agree?
What?
What makes you think he hates you, Judy?
Do you think your father means that?
Is that why you were wandering around at one o'clock in the morning?
Do you think you can get back at your Dad that way?  I mean sometimes if we can't get as close to somebody as we'd like we have to try making them jealous--so they'll have to pay attention.  Did you ever think of that?
Your mother will be down in a few minutes.
Didn't you forget something?
A man of some travels.
Gabriel, you promised!
He wants the money.
He wants... your "sister"...
Gabriel!
Slinky's in aisle five, Twister's in aisle one, Moon Mud's in aisle four.
Gotta be ten degrees out there.
I don't think it's negative five.
No --
Guy I was in with... he helped sometimes... some of the romantic stuff, actually... you'd like him --
Where the hell are you going?
Ashley, Jesus --
You forget where I work?
Well, I don't know about that --
...the truck driver...
You motherfucker.
Get the hell off of me!
My brother's killed people, I know he has. Truckers. If you talk him into thinking you're not you, you'll only get yourself dead.
Nick, please, it's me --
...maybe I die for Nick...
He said he wanted to talk to you. When he found the letters... he said "when your boyfriend gets out, I wanna talk to him." I thought he meant back in Detroit. I thought he meant --
No!
He working for them on this one?
We get to the bridge, we're all right!
We'll get there, baby... we'll get there...
I love you, Nick...
They'll have guns.
You said they've run guns, in their trucks. So they'll have guns. To do this robbery. They'll have serious guns.
I'm going to have to be inside that casino. When it happens. I'll need to be part of it. I can't just be drawing some map.
He says he wants it now.
What?
Who are you now.
You what...
So you could get with my sister.
You're a good writer, Nick. I give this writing an A-plus.
I had better sex in prison.
What'd they call her in high school?
How much money's in that casino? Day-to-day.
We walked the place for a week.
So what the hell good are you...
Bring back some memories, Nick?
A cowboy. You're going to send me into an Indian casino disguised as a cowboy. Have you thought this entirely through?
Do I get a country-western name?
Ten dollars? What do I do with ten dollars?
You were talking to him! What'd you tell him!?
Man, Monster... just... just don't start trying to hit me...
Start singing.
I want a map of that security level. Every room, every guard, every thing.
No gun.
That part, Nick... was planned out the day I read your letters.
Hey. They got a shitload of cookies.
How 'bout the tree? You want the tree?
Mister. I'm begging, 'kay? I'm begging. This is not some card club, 'kay? This is the Tomahawk. We're an international gaming destination. We're in guidebooks. You can't do this... you can't do this to me...
THE POWWOW SAFE! WHERE IS THE POWWOW SAFE!
...so where is he?
The Powwow Safe. The secret safe. You said the manager's got a safe in his office where he hides skim money.
Hi, Santa Claus, how are you. He's with Sears, I'm with Wal-Mart, twas the season...
Goddamn, Merlin. There any part of the day you don't smoke?
You want that for here or to go?
What about the money?
You knew there were guns in here!
Monsters in the gelatin...
Why you gotta say a thing like that.
Why you gotta. We were gonna give you a ride someplace, man. Now I just don't know.
Paid the Alamo ten bucks to put the shiv in me. He's a lifer, what does he care. Paid a hospital guard fifty to put out the story I was dead. Once the wound healed up...  Got out of the Mountain this morning. And tonight I'm a rich man.
Hell, you never needed to convince Ashley you were me. Just the dumb fucking truckers. I figured I'd talked enough about the Tomahawk in the pen for you to get by --
That was my card, pop! My card! You hit for my card!
POP! That was My card!
Start talkin
Map is kinda dirty, Monster...
Without having them hit the alarms.
I told you I don't know anything about any fucking set up. I've only been on the force eight months, nobody tells me anything! I don't know anything! You can torture me if you want -
That I should've picked you up?
He is a motherfucker. He won't let me leave the halfway house till I get some piece of shit job.
Holy shit, this guy's all fucked up!
I'll call somebody.
Daddy, did ya see that?
Now Vic was tellin' me, he's got a parole problem.
Daddy, I'm sorry, I don't know what's happening.
The cops were there waitin' for us!
I don't know, but somebody did.
Brown's dead, we don't know about Blue.
What does it matter who stays with the cop? We ain't lettin' him go. Not after he's seen everybody. You should've never took him outta your trunk in the first place.
The black Beverly Hills. I knew this lady from Ladora Heights once.  "Hi, I'm from Ladora Heights, it's the black Beverly Hills."
No, it wasn't Pam Grier, Pam Grier was the other one. Pam Grier made the movies. Christie Love was like a Pam Grier TV show, without Pam Grier.
Nice Guy. When we got to the bar...
The Boots and Socks in Gardena. When we got there, I met Joe and a guy named Mr. White. It's a phony name. My name's Mr. Orange.
Me and Mr. White?
I can do that.
Tell me more about Cabot.
...Her brother usually goes with her, but he's in county unexpectedly.
Myself and Mr. Pink?
Toby... who the fuck is Toby? Toby... Toby... think... think... think...
You gonna put it away?
Not a problem, got guys waitin' for it. But what happened to Marsellus Spivey? Didn't he always move your ice?
Larry, I'm gonna kill him.
He don't tip?  You don't tip? Why?
He don't believe in it?  You don't believe in it?
Aren't you?
Joe, you want me to shoot him for you?
What's this guy's problem?
You gonna bark all day, little doggie, or are you gonna bite?
Why?
For what, the cops?
Hardy-fuckin-har. What did he say?
I ain't going anywhere. I'm right here. I'm not gonna leave ya.
I wasn't born yesterday. I'm hurt, and I'm hurt bad.
Fuck jail! I don't give a shit about jail. But I can't die. You don't have to take me in. Just drive me up to the front, drop me on the sidewalk. I'll take care of myself. I won't tell them anything. I swear to fucking god, I won't tell 'em anything. Look in my eyes, look right in my eyes.  I-won't-tell-them-anything. You'll be safe.
C'mon, throw in a buck.
I don't even know a Jew who'd have the balls to say that. So let's get this straight. You never ever tip?
Gun shot.
What the fuck am I doing here? I felt funny about this job right off. As soon as I felt it I should said "No thank you", and walked. But I never fucking listen. Every time I ever got burned buying weed, I always knew the guy wasn't right. I just felt it. But I wanted to believe him. If he's not lyin' to me, and it really is Thai stick, then whoa baby. But it's never Thai stick. And I always said if I felt that way about a job, I'd walk. And I did, and I didn't, because of fuckin' money!
I'm cool.
As soon as I heard the alarm, I saw the cops.
I don't wanna kill anybody. But if I gotta get out that door, and you're standing in my way, one way of the other, you're gettin' outta my way.
At that point it became every man for himself. As far as Mr. Blonde or Mr. Blue are concerned, I ain't got the foggiest. Once I got out, I never looked back.
Nope.
I got 'em, all right?
Now you're using your head. For all we know, he's the rat.
Assuming we can trust Joe, how we gonna get in touch with him? He's supposed to be here, but he ain't, which is making me nervous about being here. Even if Joe is on the up and up, he's probably not gonna be that happy with us. Joe planned a robbery, but he's got a blood bath on his hands now. Dead cops, dead robbers, dead civilians... Jesus Christ! I tend to doubt he's gonna have a lot of sympathy for our plight. If I was him, I'd try and put as much distance between me and this mess an humanly possible.
Well Joe ain't gettin' here. We're on our own. Now, I don't know a goddamn body who can help him, so if you know somebody, call 'em.
Is that supposed to be funny?
...Hey, I know what I'm talkin' about, black women ain't the same as white women.
You should be. Maybe Lednov heard about that Sonora ranch of yours.
We're going to look for him. Want to come along?
And that's more important than finding Lednov?
All I can get out of her is she don't care about livin'.
You don't know how good it is to see you.
What's the matter with her?
They won't be riding in the wagon.
You can't leave us here.
We can't stay here!
Coffee?
I'm sorry, but that's how it's got to be.
You've earned it -- the horse ranch on the Toulomoe -- the girl in the spotted gingham.
Are we leaving?
I don't know. I thought I did. Now I'm not sure. I thought it had something to do with me.
You wouldn't do a thing like that, would you?
I'm awake now. Go on. Say what you want to say. I'll listen.
Save 'em for the girl in gingham. Just tell me I'm not good enough for you. Go on. Say a woman like me can't change.
That job you were talkin' about, did you get it yet?
Drop yours. I'm gunshy.
Here's a man says he's looking for you girls.
I -- lost something.
That's right.
Who's Lednov?
But it's leaded up and anyway a 22's no good for real huntin'. You shoot a man with a 22 and where are you?
Do you have to be so close-mouthed? I'm your brother. And I'm ridin' with you. Remember?
There was only three of them at first. I guess I lost my head.
Oh... that's the time you went away.
Want the wagon unloaded, Clay?
I didn't stop to think, Clay.
Is that the only reason you came back?
I'm sorry about this, Mr. Wyatt. I didn't know who she was.
Suppose that Lednov was to have found you, instead of me. Why you wouldn't have had a chance.
Helen -- why don't you and Mary go on with Clay?
Of course I do -- but it'd be better for you -- and the house is kind of small --
It isn't that --
But I want to stay.
She mustn't -- don't you let her --
Go on. Take your bath. I'll beat it.
That sure smells good.
I figure we'll get along just fine.
What's the matter -- restless?
With a milk pail in one hand and a marriage license in the other.
I tried my best, but these things take time.
You're not giving up?
We might as well start a fire.
Give it back to him. We're leavin'.
I'm sure of this. But not of you.  You won't open any joint. I've been watching you change. You're mad now and you think you can change back. But you can't. You'll end up making beds in a boarding house.
How far up the trail?
Because there's a man I want to see.
That won't help the stone bruise. You ain't been around horses much, looks like.
Gee, I can't.
Aren't we stayin'?
An' if you can't hunt 'em and even if you could they'd be tough, what's the use of knowin' how to spell them?
Are you okay?
Brenda was right. There's more to the story than the Professor told us. I found a secret room. It had all these news clippings about Hugh Kane. He was a very evil man.
Oh, remember that time I got my training bra and you --
Thanks.
Oh my God! We're dead!
It's coming!
Hey, look, I'm Wilma Flintstone.
Shhh... It's okay.
But, hey, maybe we can be friends.
That's just it, Buddy. I'm a girl. You can't be so rough with me.
Gentle stuff like talking, sharing thoughts and ideas, secrets and past experiences. Stuff like that, you know.
Yeah, it will be fine. I wanna check something out. Will you come with me?
I know, but I've been thinking --
Look, what I'm trying to say --
Are you okay?
Okay, I get the point.
How about these buns?
Oh my God! I'm here with the...
I'm Cindy.
Hanson, please.
It was you...
Me and my friends... You see there was this ghost. He came out of nowhere and....
Okay, I guess. It's so intimidating. You know being away from home, not knowing anyone. I feel like such a geek sometimes. Everyone's so cool and I'm so not.
Huh?
Yo! That jacket is tight.
That was a great idea, Shorty.
Oh, my God. It happened right here. She came home. She saw them.
Here you go, Professor.
Yes. The scored all over the Kiersey Temperament Sorter just like you asked for.
I'll make it part of the class. We'll tell them they're participating in a study on sleep disorders.
I have taken care of everything, including medical supplies and blood storage. We want to be safe.
Would you please focus?
Not to worry. There's been no reported activity in the house for over twenty years.
Professor, I think you should see this.
I think we should consider cutting the experiment short.
The Professor might have everyone else fooled, but I know who the real brains of the operation is.
That's what turns me on about you, Dwight. You're so smart.
You're not wearing a belt.
It's okay. I understand.
Oh shit, you gonna take that?
Father, I think you should rest.
Sit down and join us, Cindy.
Sweet. Hey, you got a tattoo, too.
"Ray!"
BLOOD FEAST!
Hi, Mom.
You'd probably date him!  He's cu-uuute! Hey, Dad, did you ever see "Henry, Portrait of a Serial Killer?"
Well, your mother's going to PTA today.  We'll see what your teacher has to say. 
Ladies and gentlemen, the perfect meatloaf!
I'm happy too and we want you to be happy.
Are you Chip Sutphin?
He goes to college with me!
Look at this!  "Hillside Strangler gets his college degree in prison!"
No woman would!
I just thought with all the sadness... you wouldn't want...
It's fine with me, Beverly.  You want to, honey? You think the kids are asleep?
Beverly! Not the Sterners!
Beverly, I've been reading all about it... is it menopause?
Did you drive your car to the PTA meeting yesterday, Mrs. Sutphin?
Well, this magazine was found in your trash just last night...  ...It's called "Chicks with Dicks".
Hello.
I know it's hard but we need the exact words.
Just a half-a-cup.  Hello, Dottie. I'm so sorry to hear of your troubles...
Did you see her?! She just said "Fuck you" to me!
State your name, please.
0h, that's horrible, honey.  I sold the Pee-Wee Herman doll!!
Beverly, are you alright?
Just the damn cable TV company. You know how they are. Did you hear about Dottie Hinkle?
That's like your car, Beverly,
Did you find your Franklin Mint egg, Rosemary darling?
That was your People magazine with the letters cut out, wasn't it?
Mrs... Sutphin?
Oooohh! A fruit cake. Thank you, Mrs. Sutphin. Have a seat.
Chip is off to a fine start this year.  Focused... conscientious... participates actively in classroom discussion.
Certainly not!
Are we leaving?
Murder, honey.
Then you know that if I give you a little advice, it'll be good advice.
That girl was looking for Jacqueline Gibson. I'd forget it if I were you.
Look, sister', Manhattan is only nine miles long and four and one half miles wide. I ain't never been off it. I know it like you know your own back yard. You get me a small retainer --say fifty bucks, and I'll get your sister for you. I guarantee
That's what she told you. I looked it up at the Hall of Records. Your sister deeded her the business as an outright girt.
You can't tell.
It's only a little way, Mr. August.
When I wanted to.
I've come from Jacqueline. She needs money.
 I didn't. She came to me a few days ago. To put it delicately her care imposes a financial burden upon me. She thought you might lighten that burden.
I haven't got that much in cash.
But tell me --
Nothing's happened to her. It's just that I can't understand her not getting in touch with you.
The tip is, anyhow. I like to work on your hair.
Some of us, Frances, must believe without understanding.
But I'd give a great deal to know.
A man would look anywhere for her, Mary. There is something exciting and unforgettable about her - something you never get hold of - something that keeps a man following after her.
Afraid she might commit suicide?  People who commit suicide don't talk about it. That room made her happy in some strange way I couldn't understand. She lived in a world of her own fancy. She didn't always tell the truth. In fact - I'm afraid she didn't know what the truth was.  There were many things about Jacqueline I didn't understand, and yet, without understanding, I had to be with her  to see her  to touch her  in order to be happy. It's hard to explain to a youngster.
Thank you. It was a lovely dinner.
The important thing is, the police won't believe you.
You told me you were pretty good with youngsters. Today I bumped into an old friend of mine, Mrs. Wheeler  She runs a settlement house down in the Village and is looking for a kindergarten teacher.
What brought you down here, Greg?
Good night, Jacqueline -- good night, Mary.
Well?
All very nice but, what are you going to do - listen at every house in New York for Jacqueline's voice?
I'm not going to wait. I'm going out -- laugh, dance --do all the things I used to do.
You'll be all right?
And you knew he'd be here.
Such a simple matter. This figure is the symbol of the Palladists.
I had begun to write again -that's whet I was doing when you came in.
I can't find Gregory. I've been trying to find him.
Would it be asking too much, Miss Gottschalk, for you to get me these books?
See that girl? That's Jacqueline's sister. It's because of her I ask.
Well, it won't work. Love and understanding won't make a good detective out of a recalcitrant poet.
I'm afraid this is no time to play Cyrano, my friend. What was in your mind?
I suppose, Jason, that you'll speak for your friend --  -- and your poetry will speak for you.
Would they hurt her?
I know the others -- Redi, Fallon, Leo, Bruns. But I would never have guessed it of you, Natalie.
I was a great dancer...
Life has betrayed us. We've found there is no heaven on earth, so we must worship evil for evil's own sake. We're not wicked. We commit no violence, unless...
No, you draw no secrets from me, as you drew them from Jacqueline. You are not one of us yet. You're clever, Louis, but I recognize your interest in me for what it is worth. You are only curious. You have never loved a woman who had but one arm.
But I'm not coming to you out of deep conviction, I'm coming to you out of loss. I no longer can believe in the power and the rightness of things that are called good.
I'm afraid not.
If I were you, Mary -- I'd go back to school. I'd make no further attempt to find Jacqueline.
Yes  yes, if she made that much impression on you, I'm sure it was Jacqueline.
I thought you might know her. She was seen here about a week ago. Her name is Jacqueline Gibson.
Children, I want you to be very good and very quiet while I see Mrs. Wheeler a moment. She's going to take over this class for a while.
That was quick.
Well...
Oh, uh-huh.
Do you want them?
Why is that?
What?
Well, my therapist knows me intimately.
What are these?
No.
What about sex?
You just ask them questions?
I don't... why... why do you do this?
I'm not sure why I came here. I had kind of decided not to talk to you after... you know.
John and Cynthia have been... "fucking".
You know?
But even if we had been speaking, I wouldn't have told you.
I want you to be aware of what you're doing and why, because I know that this is not the sort of thing you would do in a normal frame of mind.
That's a good question.
What will you do when the money runs out?
Did you have sex before you were married?
About who?
I remember. You could do that, couldn't you? Go down on me?
Why not?
That's correct.
Yes.
No, it was wonderful. That wasn't the problem.
If you do get out of your marriage, will you continue to be inhibited?
Like maybe a big part?
Look at you, look at what's happened to you, look how you've changed! Don't you think she will have changed?
All right, you want to talk about lies, let's talk about lies, Ann. Let's talk about lying to yourself. You haven't been able to sleep with your husband because you're no longer in love with him, and maybe you never were. You haven't been honest with yourself in longer than you can remember.
Then maybe I saw an old message. There are a lot of them on my desk, you know.
Something wrong?
For God's sake, Ann, I am not fucking your sister. I don't find her that attractive, for one.
I was just saying, you know? I didn't get paranoid when you didn't want to make love. I could have easily assumed that you didn't want to because you were having an affair.
I'm not either!!
I'm sorry, too. I... I get these ideas in my head, you know, and I have nothing to do all day but sit around and concoct these intricate scenarios. And then I want to believe it so I don't think I've wasted the whole day. Last week I was convinced you were having an affair with Cynthia, I don't know why.
I didn't say it was rational, I just said I was convinced.
I don't know. Sometimes I feel stupid babbling about my little problems while children are starving in the world.
Jesus Christ! What the hell happened? I came home and your car was gone, the door was open, I thought for sure you'd been abducted by some mad fucker, I was literally just calling the cops when you walked in. What happened?
Goddammit, goddammit!! That son of a bitch!!  Well, at least I know you didn't fuck him.
God damn you!!
No, I didn't.
Ann, do you see a pattern here?
You understand that you are free to leave therapy at any time?
There are many things that can exert control over one's life, good and bad. Religion, greed, philanthropy, drugs.
Besides, even if I decided to fuck his brains out, what business is that of yours?
I think you're afraid to put the two of us in the same room together. I think you're afraid he'll be undeniably drawn to me.
Well, I'll call him when he does.
What are you talking about?
Are you getting Mom something for her birthday?
A card? For her fiftieth birthday?
Don't you think she deserves a little more than a card? I mean, the woman gave birth to you. It's her fiftieth birthday --
Fine.
No, I didn't.
No!
No, he's not dangerous. Not physically.
Well, like, I don't want to tell you, exactly.
In front of him, Ann, yes.
Listen to you!! You sound like Mom. What are you talking about?
I was just trying to --
So what's my share of the dress?
Thank you.
Bye.
Did he ask me to take my clothes off? No, he didn't.
Who are you?
She called you that, too. May I ask why you're here?
No, I really can't. I find it healthy never to characterize people I don't know or conversations I haven't heard. I don't know what you and your sister discussed about me or anything else. Last time I saw Ann she left here very... confused, I would say. And upset.
Your first sexual experience.
Were you disappointed?
What about when you touched it? What did you expect it to feel like, and then what did it really feel like?
Would you like me to take my pants off?
Do you like the way I look?
I can't let my lunch hour go on too long. I've already skipped one meeting.
Well, maybe I could just start a rumor, then.
Hello.
Not today. I've got other plans.
Jesus, I don't know if I can get away. I've got a client waiting. I'd have to do some heavy duty juggling.
Hello.
Shit, after what you've told me, I don't know. I should've known, when he showed up dressed like some arty brat.
What if this tape gets into the wrong hands?
I felt like it, so what? Goddam, you and Ann make such a big deal out of it.
It won't. I trust him.
Yeah, I do. A helluva lot more than I trust you.
Plenty of room for two people.
Student?
Especially if you want to leave someplace in a hurry.
God, you need help.
No.
Give me your keys.
Your keys, asshole!! Your two fucking keys!! Give them to me!!
Answer him, goddammit!!
Well, look. How's this? You go on down to the clinic and tell that nice Dr. St. Luc...  ...you tell him that Nick's ill, he's got these lumps, and he can't get out of bed. Tell him to come when you're sure Nick'll be home. And don't tell Nick anything. Let the two of them fight it out.
OK, then. I'm gonna go back to the store and buy my own pack and smoke 'em all myself.
Well? Supper at my place?
Forsythe, Forsythe! What's wrong? What's happened?
You say something?
Make love to me, make love to me, love, love to me...
I'm still a VD man under the skin, Rog. You know me. I'm a down-to-earth kinda guy, right?
Rog, I gotta talk serious to you. Really. Listen. Ya listening? OK. I want you to come into this with me. To tell the honest-to-God truth, I'm lonely.  All Hobbes ever did was run around getting money and phone me in the middle of the night. He wanted you in anyway. That's why we were gonna get together, the three of us. We would have enough to keep us going for at least five years, even with inflation.
You want to help sick people for the rest of your life? God forbid I should talk you out of it.
BREAKING OUT
I wouldn't mind doing Janet one or two favours.
About Brad's family?
Infantile regression.
Introduce yourselves.
Right!  An early start with Janet's debut on 'Good Morning Denton.' By the time we unveil Farley's 'Faith Factory' we will have earned our beauty sleep.
When do I get to see Brad?
But...how?
Dear old Bert's settled everything.
Overreact!  You're the one with theories about conspirac...  Oliver?
I'll leave you young things to it.
Oh, Oliver.  What are we going to do?
That's us.
I'm not going, Janet.
What are you talking about? Danny Slepstrini is a chip off the old block.  I played 18 holes of golf with his father just last week.  And Hank says Danny's moved to New York.  To better himself.
Could I do that later?
BUT WITHOUT YOU AND ME, SIS  THE WORLD'D FALL TO PIECES  VENA CAVA WHO'S THE RAVER?
I NEED IT NOW I NEED SOME
Is it true they're all midgets with big heads?
He will.  But it's up to you to reawaken his feelings.  You've got to be fabulous, look, think and appear fabulous.  And Farley's given you that chance.  You can use the Breakfast Show to knock Denton dead.
You've got a really tight team around you.  And everybody needs you!
That's an extremely negative response.
This is the nerve center of operations, Janet.  You must stay here tonight.  That way we can all be here when Mr. Sun paints us a new day with his golden brush.
CRIMINAL
So all in all it's going to be an exciting new series for us...
Hang on. Did you ever know a Derek Sommersby?
You picked him up and you fucked him, didn't you, bitch?
It's Christine.  Hey you.
Actually there is word. I spoke to Keith Kurtzman this morning.
Lot of good stuff.  Got the new Bien Nacido. Want a taste?
How's it hanging, Miles?
Jeez, Mrs. Raymond, that was eleven years ago.
Is it chicken?
She was good for you.  And so beautiful and intelligent. You knew her, right?
Hey, guys. How's it going?
You're a bad, bad girl, Stephanie.
I'm thinking about the duck breast.
Oh yeah? What kind of stuff?
Come on. You're fucking hungover.
...and that one of the editors was passing it up to a senior editor. She was supposed to hear something this week, but now it's next week, and... It's always like this. It's always a fucking waiting game. I've been through it too many times already.
Don't open that now. It's warm.
Pinot Noir? How come it's white? Doesn't noir mean dark?
Let me show you something. The secret to opening champagne is that once the cork is released, you keep pressure on it so you don't --
It'd be the best thing for you. You know what? I'm going to get you laid this week. That's going to be my best man gift to you. I'm not going to give you a pen knife or a gift certificate or any of that other horseshit.
You still seeing that shrink?
This is rose, right?
First take your glass and examine the wine against the light. You're looking at color and clarity.
Depends on the varietal. Just get a sense of it. Thick? Thin? Watery? Syrupy? Inky? Amber, whatever...
What do you smell?
Huh. Maybe a little strawberry. Yeah, strawberry. I'm not so sure about the cheese.
Are you chewing gum?
Jack, this is where I eat when I come up here. It's practically my office. And sometimes I have a drink with the employees. Maya's great. She's worked here about a year, maybe a year and a half.
Ooooooohh. Now we're getting somewhere.
The chick digs you. She lit up like a pinball machine when she heard your novel was getting published.
Single. Waitress. Getting off work. Looking for love. A little slap and tickle.
So what're we going to have? Pigs in a blanket? The "rancher's special breakfast"? Or maybe just some grease and fat with a side of lard?
A bad girl, Miles. She might need to be spanked.
You know how often these pourers get hit on?  I'm going for a swim. Get the blood flowing. Want to come?
Do not sabotage me. If you want to be a lightweight, that's your call. But do not sabotage me.
You go. In fact, use my clubs. They're brand new -- gift from Christine's dad.  It's on me. Oh, say, by the way, Stephanie and me were thinking we'd all go to the Hitching Post tonight and sit at one of Maya's tables, and she'll bring us some great wines and then we can all --
Oh, boy.
You should call her.
Oh, you've been thinking. And?
Being with Stephanie has opened my eyes. She's not uptight or controlling. She's just cool. Things are so easy with her. Smells different. Tastes different. Fucks different. Fucks like an animal. I'm telling you, I went deep last night, Miles. Deep.
I was hoping to get some understanding from you. And I'm not getting it.
Like I might be in love with another woman.
This is totally different. I'm talking about avoiding what you're talking about. That's the distinction. I have not made the commitment yet. I am not married. I have not said the words. In a few days, I might get married, and if I do, then I won't be doing stuff like this anymore. Otherwise, what's the whole point of getting married?
You know, in life you gotta strike when the iron's hot.
What about your agent? Hear anything yet?
Been checking your messages?
Is it the money thing?
We're going to have some fun. Remember fun? We're going to have some of it. Okay?
I said okay?
You ever actually read any of this guy's books?
Yo! Yo! Here's my boy! Here's my boy! Who's your daddy, boy? Who is yo' daddy?
You didn't get any, did you?  You're a homo.
This whole week has gone sour. It isn't turning out like it was supposed to.  I want to go home.
Let me use your phone.
What about that guy who wrote Confederacy of Dunces? He committed suicide before he got published, and look how famous he is.
Well?
Good thing you have a voice-over career.
She gets off in an hour, so I think I'm just going to have a drink and then... make sure she gets home safe.
No. She ordered them special. Took her forever to find them. They've got this design on them with dolphins and our names engraved in Sanskrit. We've got to go back. Christine'll fucking crucify me.
So what's the plan?
Hey, Jack. Jack.
Come on, let me drive.
What's wrong?
What the fuck!
Well. That about does it.
I'm doing good, good. You look great. Did you lose some weight?
Oh yeah? How is it?
Nice. Very nice.
The day you open a '61 Cheval Blanc, that's the special occasion.
Is this Stephanie's kid? Sure is cute.
So what's your novel about?
Oh. You mean... today?
So is it kind of about death and mortality, or...?
Oh yeah. Who cares? I'm the queen of typos.  Wow, this is really starting to open up. What do you think?
I don't know. Why are you into wine?
I had a good time tonight, Miles. I really did.
Okay. See you around.
Hey, Miles, I heard you came by the restaurant last night looking for me.
Please believe me. I was even on the verge of telling you last night, but...
Oh, Maya. No.
I guess I just thought there was still some hope for us somewhere down the road and I just, I just --
Hi, Vicki.  You look beautiful.
That's great.
Well, let's go have some champagne, shall we? Toast all the newlyweds.
You quit drinking?
Oh. Huh. Well...  Congratulations again, Vicki. That's wonderful news.
So what do you think?
What's everyone ordering? Then we can sort out the wine.
Should we get dessert?
See you, Miles. You take care.
Stephanie! Stop!
What's wrong with the water next to your bed?
No.
I think it's contaminated.
I was just taking a walk before dinner.
And tell Merrill to swing away.
You do?
Okay, this guy is trying to scare us. He's messed with our property, he's coming around the house. It's time for an ass whoopin'!
Explain, act crazy?
No I'm not.
I'm sorry, what book is this?
They're on the roof.
Don't touch him.
Graham.
It needs batteries.
It says they're probably very small -- like my height -- because, as their brains developed, there was no use for physical development. It says they're probably vegetarians, because they would have realized the benefits of such a diet.
They said one of two things could happen. One, they fight and are defeated and leave to return again with full forces hundreds or even thousands of years later.
We'll have to board up the bedroom doors.
What about Isabelle?
What's that?
You said something was strange. What's strange?
It's not broken.
You can't describe him at all? Don't you think that's find of odd?
It's good advice...  Say hi to Marcia for me.
There was an accident. Drunk driving. They weren't sure.
They think these look like stages immediately proceeding an attack maneuver.
I'd get down if I were you. They may be up there now.
I think we lost 'em.
Forget it.
Where are we?
I'll go. I'll bring Jake out here.
Gotta go.
Goodbye?
You don't make it easy on a fellow.
You must have known that before you came.
I've got my people sitting down there...  ...swatting flies and raring to go.
Me, I'm riding along, minding my own business. Four cowboys come by and we decide to ride together for a while, friendly as can be. I always figure you might as well approach life like everybody's your friend or nobody is... don't make much difference. We get out in the middle of that frying pan and suddenly everybody's pointing their gun but me. I guess they admired my horse. She's a great one, a sweet little bay.
You might make a farmer yet.
Daddy?
He acted bravely out there, Hannah. Just bad luck his getting hit. Could have been any one of us.
Because they don't like what I want.
It was not -- it was Murdo's. Those McKendricks don't know how to act like human beings.
Where's your brother?
You wanted to see me?
What are you talking about?
You can't do this.
You misunderstand. I want you out of town. In fact, I want you all the way out of my jurisdiction.
I don't like that word much, Carter.
The jury saw it differently.
Good old Paden. I was hoping you'd changed your mind about the job.
Easy, boy. Just an idea.
What a waste. This could have been such a sweet deal for us.
My compliments to you, Miss Stella. This is what I call a saloon.
I don't own this place. The man who does stuck me with Kelly.
Is this a fair mix?
-- Forgive me, Mr. Taransky.  I'm just trying to understand.  All these films, TV appearances, magazine covers, internet interviews, publicity photos, snapshots from her childhood -- all fake.  This is fake, this is fake -- fake, fake, fake, all fake.
-- Do you know what these are, Elaine?
Not just any Mike & Ike's -- cherry Mike & Ike's.  Do you know why I, Viktor Taransky, two-time Academy Award nominated director --
-- I have a feeling you're going to tell me.
-- What's wrong with that?
You realize you're nostalgic for an era you weren't even born in?
I can't wait to meet her.
Why not?
There isn't one.
I'd love to tell her myself.  When are you going to let me meet her?
Everyone I know has met her, Viktor.
Really?
I'd love to.  But aren't you supposed to meet up with Simone?
-- Viktor, are you with her?  Is she there?
Viktor, do you realize you always do that?
I was thinking -- what about you and... "Simone" moving back in with me and Lainey?
Don't look so glum, Viktor.  It's not a death sentence.
You understand you'll have to come back to my place to keep them off the, er...  ... scent.
Yes, of course, but very beautiful in your own right.
"Why are we here?  Is that what you're asking, Jack?... Why are we here?  No why.  Just here".
Well, no one could accuse you of being over-exposed, Simone.  Why have you stayed so completely out of the limelight?
Don't I know it.  That's the only reason I'm here now -- to put the attention back where it belongs, on Mr. Taransky's film.
Nudity has just never been an issue for me, Frank.  For me, clothes are just an option.
-- Simone, the question on everyone's mind is simply... "why?"
The film.  The chemistry.  No reflections on Nicola but Simone and I -- we were just so right together.
And still the connection was undeniable.  I haven't read "Eternity Forever" but I know it's brilliant.  And I know I would be perfect for Clive.
-- No.  No.  A real wall.  You ran right through it.
-- Mr. Taransky, Mr. Taransky... thank God.  I've been trying to see you, calling -- Your assistant wouldn't put me through.  I told her it was a matter of life and death.  I was afraid I wouldn't get to you in time --
I have her, Mr. Taransky.  The answer to your prayers.  The answer to this.
It's me, Mr. Taransky.  Don't you recognize me? -- The Future of Film conference in San Jose. Hank... Hank Aleno.  I was keynote speaker.  You must remember my speech... "Who Needs Humans?"
There's a rumor that you're more than just "good friends"?
Hi, Dad.
Those things can be dangerous. Staring at a screen all day -- you miss what's going on outside in the real world.  You can lose yourself. You should get out more.  How are you going to meet boys?
How?
Okay, Dad.
One thing bothered me.
So that accounts for the lack of a shadow in reel six?
Too impersonal.  They have to meet face-to-face.
-- Plead guilty and throw yourself on the mercy of the court.  It's the best deal you're going to get.
You certainly will if you go to trial -- a jury in this kind of ugly mood.  You've killed an icon, for God's sake.
Do I know you?
She sounds like a prisoner, Taransky.  Are you holding her hostage?  Are you some kind of Svengali?
The cops?  The cops read my column to know who to bust.  We're the only watchdog the public has.  None of this is going away.  We'll be here tomorrow and the day after that.  Until you slip up.  And you will.  You are looking at your shadow.  Because all these elaborate precautions with Simone -- every instinct in my body tells me, it's not natural.
Nice boat, Taransky.
Alright, Sayer, you've got a deal.
I traced her to a nursing home.  A young woman fitting Simone's description dropped her off five years ago.
Shutter bugs camped outside any place he goes, every concierge and maitre d' on the take.  But this Simone woman is good.
Would you like me to read?
What if it catches on fire?
Let's take it down a notch.
You mean they buy it?
Is that better, Mr. Taransky?
Mr. Taransky, we both know I was nothing without you.  I was computer code -- ones and zeros.
Why, Malcolm?
Why did you leave me?
What was that you were saying before with your soldiers? Day pro fun.
I'm going to see you again, right?
We were supposed to draw a picture. Anything we wanted... I drew a man. He got hurt in the neck by another man with a screwdriver.
You want to ask me a question?
I walk this way to school with Tommy Tammisimo.
Know what?
You said the "s" word.
Mr. Marschal gets real lonely.
Yes.
No.
Don't cry.
Dr. Crowe?
You really look better.
It's Spanish. It means... 'I don't want to die.'  Not all the ghosts are scary, are they? Like Mrs. Marschal?
What if they don't want help? What if they're just angry and they want to hurt somebody?
You were great in the play, Cole.
And you know what else?
They're right here.
It was Grandma's. It's not for playing.  What if it broke? You know how sad I'd be.
You can see her?
She wanted me to tell you--
How did you--?
I work at an insurance place and at Penny's, so Cole can go to that good school.
Could take a little while, though.
Fuck you! If you're such an expert on music, why don't you go get your dueling banjo and sit in on the next song?
Hey! Don't use all the hot water!
Let me guess. We're going on a "long trip".
Aha. The Lovers.
Hey, isn't that the preacher?
You're not going to arrest me for it, are you?
Sounds familiar.
Okay. My main man. Marvin Gaye.
Wait a second. Did you say "patricide?"
That's not patricide. Patricide is when you gun down your old man.
Curt Cobain.
Well, there goes our record deal.
"With a hack-hack here --"
Joseph Macdonald... Your son.
I came back for the funeral. That's all.
Was. You ain't afraid of ghosts, now are you?
I wouldn't pay Jesse no mind at all. She's just a crazy old woman. Hasn't been right in the head since her husband passed away.  Wasn't much right before that, neither.
You like it? Irrigation system. Your grandaddy built it himself. Saved the land from dying.
Ow!
Hey -- Macdonald's farm!
It's a farm, Keith. You're not supposed to shoot the rooster.
Chicken sandwich?
You wanna know the difference? The difference is that you're screwing up the song.
Yes!
Is that right?
Name something.
I'm talking to the spirit of Jethro Macdonald. Is it okay to have sex in your old attic with your grandson? We'll be careful of the bed --
Getting ready.
Strange... I can feel my old self coming back...
You wouldn't understand.
...no... Mac... p-please...
Hey. Anyone here need lessons, just talk to me.
She's a Tarot Card Reader at a shopping mall.
Like your guitar break.
Someone better tell Mac.
It gets worse. He's cut all the phone lines.
Shit.
And that makes you look like a squid?
What you up to?
There's a place over there on the bluffs. When the fog is just right, like tonight, the lights of Main look like a kaleidoscope.
We'll just head up here into Bishopville, get checked up in the hospital. Then maybe we'll head off to Hollywood after all, huh?
What's she see in that douchebag?
Where are you?!
What?
Looks like a chipmunk.
Oh, shit! I hope she ain't a police radio aficionado. If so, I apolog
Grant? Grant, I'm hungry. I'm so fuckin' hungry I think I'm gonna die.
Meat.
Sure thing, killer.
It's just a work thing.
Flip.
What are you doing?
I loved you. I loved --
He took him over. His body. His -- his brain, everything what he knew. He's only been dumb stuff before amoeba--things, and rhino--things. He liked being human. Didn't want to change.
Where'd he go?
Praise Jesus.
Maybe you better sit back down. You don't look so good.
Get your hands off my daughter!
What's he get if he wins here?
You're crazy, man. Smart dresser, but crazy.
Well?...
You have a great profile.
Anything?
You know, my mother was a dancer, too. Her big shot was the touring company of 'Brigadoon.' She's been married three times. To a redneck, a poet and her tennis instructor.  See, I motor-mouth when I get nervous. I was nervous when I first got into the car. Now I'm scared shitless.
See ya, Kate.
Let's hit it.
-- Trucking ain't the easiest life in the world. I mean, you can't make it much past fifty and you sure as shit don't get a gold watch when you hang it all up. But I like keeping on the move. You know?
I guess if there's one lesson I've learned, it's that even misery has a tough time hitting a moving target.  I forgot your question?
I'm proud of you.
I been thinking. Maybe I should drop you in Montgomery. I mean, the way things are going, it might get pretty hairy by the time we get to Atlanta.
-- Actually, my heaviest relationship was with a rock singer named Ramblin' Bobby Holt. When I turned twenty- one, I went to Europe with visions of being free and independent. My luck, he was on the plane. I landed in Paris and fell in love before I could claim my baggage.  We were together for almost a year. I thought he was it.
My very words.
What are you gonna do when you get home?
Sure I can't interest you in anything else?
That means we gotta average ninety- four miles per.  Forget it.
Why are we doing this?
I hate to say I told you so.
I'm 'bout four miles ahead of you, turkey.
My vocal cords are fine, but Fred's ain't. He's been barking, eating the seats and driving me crackers.  Hear that? Where's his chow?
You're coming up to the scale house.
Bandit I, let me offer my heartiest congratulations and a piece of advice.
Breaker. Breaker.
Breaker. Breaker.
Thanks for the break. Bandit, this here's the Dixie Chicken.
Pop, a K-Whopper's worth seventy thou.
Oh, yeah. Good for him.
I'm Kate. You must be Cledus.
But with these down, doesn't that pose a major security concern if, as you say, you have to keep an eye on everything at all times?
Is your security team armed?
I tell you, engineering this kind of play against Sparazza, going to the lengths these guys are going to... they're playing some long odds.
Unreal, this guys jacket too. Wall- to-wall major felony offenses, murder, extortion, arson, grand larceny --  -- A paternity suit... I just feel like we're playing catch-up with all this and we shouldn't be.
Did the Justice lawyers sign off?
What about the sheriff's task force?
Maroon uniforms?
How bad?
No.
-- run both those names through the D.C. database. Call San Francisco, see if they've got anybody in the field doing collateral inquiries for --
You're sure?
I did. We -- yeah, I know.
But there were more of you?
Really?
There are certain meds, certain intravenous measures that can counteract some of the damage you've done, but I'd have to administer them myself.
What happened?
I said that we were returning his call and you were real concerned, because he sounded real concerned.
I dunno... Cinnamon roll?
That's probably him now...
-- Buddy, it's bigger than that, they want 'em all, Ivy, Beanie --
Sparazza is rumored to have performed in excess of one-hundred and thirty contract murders, including one of the bureau's most celebrated agents. Freeman Heller. You heard of "The Turnpike Murders" that was Sparazza.
So he's personally issued the contract on Israel?
So the wiretaps we conducted on Serna and Padiche, the mention of Israel's heart?
I can't discuss --
...Are you insane?
You realize that Sparraza has had thirty-six major medical procedures performed on him since 1953? Elective plastic surgery, every single one --
...Yeah, fifty-three.
I'll overlook what you've done here today in light of what's taken place. You've been fully debriefed. Now I want you to return to D.C. immediately and make no further inquiry into this matter. I mean it. It's closed.
Alright, now Buzzy -- this is, this is it, here, okay, so listen to me careful and wait till I'm finished 'cuz we got no room for slop.
... Jesus... what for?
That's not a problem. Are we goin' outta pocket ourselves?
No shit.
I feel like I know you girl. I feel like I've known you forever.  You gonna lemme see your scars?
What were you doin' here anyway?
...So you heard from Keith? He still fuckin' with that 'lil light-skinned girl?
-- I don't know, I feel like you always pushin' up on me, gettin' close and I love you baby, in every way you can love a bitch, 'cept that one.
What'd you say?
Forty-five apiece for you two, ten percent finders fee for me.
You'll end up like me.
You have to give me your word you won't come in.  Then I'll come out.
You killed her!
You fucking bastard...
You didn't bring any chocolate, did you?
In his lab.  He won't let you in.
Is there anybody else here?
Tell me.  I won't think you're insane.
How much sleep do you need?
Well, I think we're reaching the point of diminishing returns here, right?  Certainly it's learning more about us than we'll ever learn about it.
They come when you sleep.
Why do you think she hasn't suggested that?  It's the most obvious solution: Escape.  She knows she can't leave here --
Kelvin, she'll disintegrate.  You don't believe me?  Let's radio that shuttle pod you launched -- better yet, let's go get it.  I've charted it's trajectory, only take a few hours...
Don't.
You want to fuck her?
You go home.
What do you remember?
Do you remember Beethoven?  The Beatles?  Movies, books, restaurants, friends?
Then it's God, right?
I would have these -- I don't know how to describe them -- visions, when I was younger.  Maybe not visions, but like these waking dream states.  Time would just collapse, I would be inside time.  I would stare at a second hand on a clock until it stopped.  Freaky stuff.
I can't help feeling that I'm cheating when I take them.
Do you have any idea how much I like fucking you?
What does Snow think you should do?
He has a point.
What's wrong.
No.
Chris, I had to.  I had to.  I didn't think you'd react like this.
You're lying.
I wish you wouldn't.
He won't do it.
They are not autonomous individuals and they're not actual persons. They are projections materializing from our minds, based on a given individual.
Snow, get up here, now.
Claire!
Looks a little constipated to me.
Do you have another tie?  Something more conservative?
What did he say?
Are you nervous?
I'll have a spritzer, order something soft for yourself... I must go for a pee.
You all right?
Claire?
Didn't do very well, did you?
That's the dumbest walk I ever saw!
You could do better.
I'm perfectly calm, I'm a normal human being.  I'm going for a walk in the park.
Stop, will you?!
Yeah.
You told her?
Do you?
"For"...?
Hello, Claire.  How extraordinary that you came.
... You know, and I know, that the only thing standing between a life sentence for Venza and his freedom is my testimony at his trial...
I just saw it in the mirror, it doesn't look like my ass anymore.
So how'd it go?
Don't start... The only reason is that the neighborhood's shi...  ... crummy.  I just don't like the idea of leaving you alone here at night.
Changing the sparks.  They showed it on TV.  What d'you think?
Honey.  You got him.
What did she say the down payment was?
I know you're her bodyguard.  Did she buy it or did you?
Did you hear what I said?
You gotta get another tour.  We're gettin' too old for this.
I already did.  I mean, I talked to his wife, and she talked to him...
It wasn't a bad bust.  He gave himself up because he knew I was gonna nab him.
What about when she identifies him?!
I heard a lot... Anything you want to deny, Mike?
Shit!  A Nursemaid!  My first detail, and I'm a fuckin' slug!  I got a 'choice' at all.
... Hard?
Bullshit!  Prove it.
Nice threads Dad.
How about dinner tonight?
What "plans?"  You and Mom got "plans?"
Shooting.
Sexual tension...
Well, look who's dressing for success.
Peter-- you took this picture?
So, uh... how's college goin'?
I was there.
Hey, guys.  Check it out-- I saw this dud on the tube last night. He is incredibly cool.
Flash, get lost.
What's in there?
"Scholarship students must maintain dignity at all times."
Great idea.  Let me get some shoes. I'll take you home.
You're so responsible it's disgusting. But you're my only friend... do you hate me?
You get mugged or something?
Oh, I need your notes from the classes I missed.
You taking extension classes, Mr. Jameson?
Can't focus...
I don't give a gerbil's ass how you got 'em!  I can't print this surreal garbage!
No! Washington Square, manhole covers turn into flying saucers and radios explode like A-bombs.  Did you get pictures?
Relax, Jameson.  This is business. I know you want photos of me, so I'll give your boy Parker an exclusive.  On one condition--
No refund on the mask, y'know. Health laws.
What's this? A cockaroach?
An even five I throw in the jacket.
Can I get you a snack-- a housefly, maybe?
I'll hate myself in the morning for asking, but what exactly makes you any more amazing than the average jerk on the street?
Are you quite finished?
Some things you should say anyway.
I hate--
No.  I was lying about the coffee.
They keep saying there's nothing I could've done.  That's a lie.  I could've done something.  If only I'd paid attention to my feelings.
You were the last one to see Thorkel.  In Octavius' hospital room.
Roz? Rosomoff?  What is it?
When I moved out, you swore up and down you wouldn't meddle--
I'll introduce you.
Peter, you're bleeding.
Ha.  Anti-gravitational particles.
What you've done is make the entire physics department look foolish. You compare yourself to Einstein; your colleagues compare you to Bozo the Clown.
Then you'll be glad to know the University has decided not to press criminal charges against you. Breaking and entering the minor matter of the total destruction of a 23 million dollar cyclotron
Otto, I don't like Thorkel any more than you do.  But he has got a point.
Peter, what can I do for you?
So they're airing this tonight?
... a couple a drinks at Sardi's?
I asked if you felt like a drink--
You're sure you're all right.
Loonytunes.  And yet...
I see.  Well, Octavius won't get much further. They'll catch him and... put him away.  Sad.  He might very well have the truth.
We made a deal with Barrack One.
Where's Hoffy? Why don't we get any news about Dunbar?
What's the matter? You on their team now? You think I'm the guy?
So long, Cookie. The department store is all yours. What's left of it.
What's your beef, boys? So I'm trading. Everybody here is trading. Only maybe I trade a little sharper. So that makes me a collaborator.
You would, would you? Listen, Stupe -- the first week I was in this joint somebody stole my Red Cross package, my blanket and my left shoe. Well, I wised up since. This ain't no Salvation Army -- this is everybody for himself. Dog eat dog.
Static is right! The radio's static, Patton's static, we're static!
Just what makes you and them Krauts so buddy-buddy?
Don't ask me. Price was elected Security.
The S.S. Men are here to pick up Dunbar. They're taking him to Berlin. Looks like he's finished.
Cut out the guff, Schulz. We're on to you. You know everything that's happening in this barrack. Who's tipping you off?
Come on, Schulz! Spill it! How did you get the information? About Manfredi and Johnson? About the stove and the tunnel? Who's giving it to you? Which one of us is it?
Lieutenant Dunbar? It wouldn't be James Schuyler Dunbar? From Boston?
Shut off the moaning, or we'll have the dogs on us. Shut it off, Lieutenant. This is orders!
What did you expect, a St. Bernard dog?
Let's blow, Chauncey.
I'm okay here. Why bother?
You are being rude again.
I didn't do it. I was in the Frankfurt station and the train was three miles away when it blew up.
Well, Herr Inspector! How did you find the camp? Crowded but gemuetlich, shall we say?
It is.
Interesting.
Aufstehen, gentlemen! Please! You do not want to stay in bed on such a beautiful morning we are having today!
Jawohl!
How? We go to California. I got a cousin that's working for the Los Angeles Gas Company. That's how we get the address, see? Isn't that clever? I take you up to her house and ring the doorbell and say, 'Congratulations, Miss Grable. We have voted you the girl we'd most like to be behind barbed wire with, and I'm here to present the award'.
What d'ya think, jerko! You're the award!
Don't you remember, Animal? A chicken lays those things.
Ain't that too bad! Tomorrow he'll have to suck a raw egg!
Wunderbar! Isn't he wunderbar!
That's what I wanna hear.
Hey! This is with a typewriter! It's from a finance company!
That Schulz pig. I'll get him yet.
Do Grable.
There, Joey -- ain't that better than being a lawyer?
But it's not just those legs. It's that nose of yours I'm crazy about. That cute little button of a nose!
Betty! Betty!
Sergeant Hoffman from Barrack 4.
You're wasting your time, Duke.  Outside, everybody! Let's get it over with.
I don't know what your scheme is, but it sounds crazy.
Los, los. Dummkopf!
Sometimes I think he is fooling us with that crazy business.
We know! We got them last year. Five minutes after the Geneva Man was gone, the blankets were gone.
You heard that, Sefton?
Two packs of cigarettes say Dunbar never gets out of the compound.
Look, Sefton, I had my hands full so they wouldn't tear you apart --
You taking Dunbar?
Now you've done it. You've given me nervous indigestion.  Anything else bothering you, boys?
I went to school with a guy named Price. But that was in Boston. You're from Cleveland, aren't you.
Stop that, will you!  Those idiots! So they sprang Dunbar! So what good is it? He's still in the compound, isn't he? How long can he last? Where can they hide him?
Which one of us is the informer?
We have no radio.
Wie hat er's gemacht?
Three hundred cigarettes! What is it you want from me?
I'll make it five hundred!
Hey, Schulz -- as long as you're going to move somebody in -- how about a couple of those Russian broads?
Have a nice time over there?
It's working.
Target their Bridge.
According to our information, the ribbon is a conflux of temporal energy which travels through our galaxy every 39.1 years
According to our current information, the destruction of the Amargosa star has had the following effects in this sector: gamma emissions have increased by .05 percent, the starship Bozeman was forced to make a course correction, a research project on Gorik IV was halted due to increased neutrino particles, ambient magnetic fields have decreased by-

Data, are you all right?
Looks like you're stuck with emotions for a while. How do you feel?
Could we access the defective coil and trigger their cloak?
This is the Nexus?
Left behind?
Guinan, can I leave the Nexus?
Excuse me, gentlemen, if you'll take your seats.
Yes.  Thank you.
Sulu. When did he find the time for a family?
Aye.
Keep her together until I get back.
Sir?
Hmm,  Inform Starfleet Command. This could indicate a new Romulan threat in this sector.
There is something else, Captain. One of the scientists, a Doctor Soran,has insisted on speaking with you.  I told him you were busy, sir, but he said it was absolutely imperative that he speak with you right away.
Captain, Im sorry.  I know there were a lot of unresolved conflicts between you and your brother.
You felt it was no longer your responsibility to carry on the family line.
Careful, Captain. That's a fifty gigawatt forcefield. I wouldn't want to see you get hurt.
These blast patterns are consistent with Type III disruptors.
Steady... Steady, boys. Keep scanning...  I thought you people were reliable... Where the hell is he!
Mr. Chekov, I ordered Spock's quarters sealed!
Will we get another ship?
Admiral, there is no response from the Grissom on any channel.
I'd swear something was there sir, but I might have imagined it.
Nothing on my scanner, sir.
Could it be Spock's?
I don't believe it...
Why don't we beam it up?
Hello, sir. It's David.
Sector two... Indicating desert terrain. Minimal vegetation, temperature thirty-nine point four.
All the varieties of land and weather known to Earth within a few hours walk!
My readings indicate great instability.
Well. There's your life form reading. These were microbes on the tube's surface. We shot them here from Enterprise.  They were fruitful, and multiplied.
What is it?
Whoever they are, they're getting closer.
Very well. Exercise caution, Lieutenant. This landing is Captain's discretion and I'm the one who's out on a limb.
Captain, this is Saavik. Come in, please...
I'm almost done, sir. You'll be fully automated by the time we dock.
Mr. Scott...
As promised, she's all yours, sir. All systems automated and ready. A chimpanzee and two trainees could run her.
Mr. Scott?
I'm all right -- stand by to return fire! Mr. Scott, transfer power to the phaser banks --
What happened...?
Yes, Admiral. But that may not be possible.
My God...
Yes, yes, Spock...
... Admiral, what's going to happen to Enterprise?
The word, sir?
Count on our help, sir.
... We have cleared Spacedoors.
If I read this right, sir, we have full power.
Would you look at that?
Where's Doctor McCoy?
Admiral, I don't understand. The Enterprise --
Yours...?!
Maltz. Prisoners are at beam coordinates. Standby...
Genesis, I want it.
I -- saw no future --
What must I do?
What you ask is difficult.
Share this with no one.
Range: 3000 Kellicams.
1,000 Kellicams, closing!
Sir, may I --
But it's damn irregular. No destination orders, no encoded i.d...
Well -- what are we going to do about it?!
Twenty-two, eighty-three...
But I'm allergic to Retlax.
What DO you want? Damn it, why isn't there a girl here? You know this has nothing to do with age. This is about you flying a goddamn computer console when you wanna be out hopping Galaxies.
Don't mince words, Bones; tell me what you really think.
Doctors lose patients sometimes. Damn. I'm <u>still</u> in the dark: How'd he know about Genesis?
Now that's what I call a meal.
Lieutenant, you are looking at the only Starfleet cadet who ever beat the no-win scenario --
You okay, Jim? How do you feel?
I still don't under --
... see you but can't hear. Did you... order...?
It is a far far better thing I do than I have ever done before... a far better resting place I go to than I have ever known...
How can you let them pull that stuff on you? They're just lazy.
Well, don't have kittens. Genesis is going to work. They'll remember  you in a wreath with Newton, Einstein, Surak...
This? It took the Starfleet corps of engineers ten months in space suits to tunnel out all this. What we did in there -- we did in a day. David, why don't you show Dr. McCoy and the Lieutenant our idea of food.
All right, let's get on the Comm-pic to Doctor Marcus. Maybe it's something we can transplant.
I told you! I told you I saw a --
It's a long story.
It's the Genesis Wave!
I didn't expect anything.
Not like this -- no. I haven't faced death, I cheated death. I tricked my way out of death and patted myself on the back for my ingenuity. I know nothing.
It was just words.
I was wrong about you. And <u>I'm</u> sorry.
What are you looking at?
Well?
Tactical!
On screen.
Mr. Scott, you old space dog. You're well?
Every young boy's fancy. I seem to remember it myself.  Very well. Mr. Scott, are your engines capable of handling a minor training cruise?
If he hadn't, we'd be space by now.
Yes, Spock.
Kirk to Enterprise. Damage report, Spock?
I believe you'll find everything shipshape, Admiral.
Is the word given?
I assume you are loitering here to learn what efficiency rating I plan to give your cadets.
I know of your fondness for antiques.
Hrummm... and where are you off to, now?
There's a first time for everything, Admiral.
I would not presume to debate you.
Twelve hours and forty-three minutes, present speed.
Scanners and sensors still inoperative. There's no way to tell what's  inside the station.
Affirmative, Admiral.
A distinct possibility.
Sporadic energy readings port side, aft. Could be an impulse turn.
... the good of the few...
Very well.
A no-win situation is a possibility every commander may face. Has that never occurred to you?
This is damned peculiar.  Yellow alert.
Reliant's command...
Begging the Admiral's pardon: General Order 15: 'No  flag officer shall beam into a hazardous area without armed escort.'
Indeterminate life signs.
Time from my mark...
Time!
Aye, sir. On course to Ceti Alpha. All is well.
Leaving Section Fourteen for Section Fifteen.
Shields activated!
We're over our heads. Mr. Sulu, get us out of here.
Aft thrusters, Mr. Sulu.
Prepare for warp speed.
We commend the soul of our brother departed. We love we commit his body to the depths of space.
All moorings are clear, Captain.
Take her out, Mr. Saavik.
Sir, may I quote General Order 12: 'On the approach of any vessel, when communications have not been est --
As you wish, since you deem them of value. But I cannot wait here to find them.
I would accept that as an axiom.
Professor Scott, I'm Dr. Nichols, plant manager. I'm terribly sorry but there's been an awful mix-up Would you believe I was never told about your visit?
Sure, slingshot around the Sun. If you pick up enough speed you're in time warp. If you don't, you fry..
Jim, you've got to let me go in there! Don't leave him in the hands of Twentieth Century medicine.
Wake up, man, wake up!
Umm. Well, just wanted to say -- nice to have your katra back in your head, not mine.  I mean, I may have carried your soul, but I sure couldn't fill your shoes.
You mean I have to die to discuss your insights on death?
What's your degree in, dentistry?
A simple evacuation of the expanding epidural hematoma will relieve the pressure.
Damage report!
... It gives me a great sense of history.
My name is Pavel Chekov. I am a Lt. Commander in Starfleet, United Federation of Planets, service number 656-5827b.
My name?
Operational, Admiral. Cloaking Device now available in all modes of flight.
We are in an enemy wessel, sir. I didn't wish to be shot down on thee way to our own funeral.
Ah, well done, team 2.
Status report, Admiral!
"Neutralized?" How?
Attempting the hell to communicate.
So you were at Berkeley.
You sure you won't change your mind?
There's really very little point in my trying to explain.
We don't want to be any trouble.
They're gonna hafta take their chances.
How will that be done, exactly?
You know, I could take those whales somewhere they wouldn't be hunted.
Thanks. Cheers.
My whales? Where could you take them where they'd be safe?
I'm all ears.
Well, "Admiral," that may be the strangest dinner of my life and the biggest cockamamie fish story I've ever heard.
Sorry, that's classified.  I don't really have a clue who you are... You wouldn't want to show me around your space ship, would you?
Gillian... Would the whales be at sea by now?
All I need is the radio frequency to track them.
I have no time to argue, Gillian. Or even tell you how much you've meant to us... The <u>frequency</u>.
The late 20th Century.
Availability of fuel components; Mass of the vessel through a time continuum, and the probable location of Humpbacks, in this case, the Pacific basin.
Well, Spock, thanks to your restored memory and a little bit of luck, we are in the streets of San Francisco looking for a pair of humpback whales.  How do you propose to solve this minor problem?
I think we'll find what we're looking for at the Cetacean Institute in Sausalito. Two Humpbacks called George and Gracie.
As you observed, a primitive Culture.
Oh, the complete works of Jacqueline Susan, the novels of Harold Robbins....
Status?
Mr. Spock, where the hell is the power you promised me?
Mr. Sulu, take the con. I'm taking our guest down to see her whales.  Mr. Spock: have you accounted for the variable mass of whales and water in your time re-entry program?
Aye, sir. Descending.
Sir -- I've got some back pressure on manual --
Systems report.  Communications?
Admiral, I am receiving whale songs.
Individual whale song getting stronger... This is strange, Admiral. The song is directly ahead. It's coming from San Francisco.
Unidentified aircraft, 40,000 feet MSL, range 30 miles, bearing 010.
Mr. Scott, how soon can we get underway?
That should be enough. Can you enclose it to hold water?
I'm ready Spock. Let's go find George and Gracie...
And... Here is a deposition I have made. If it is not sufficient, I will return to Earth to testify.
Genesis was perfectly named: The creation of life not death. It was the Klingons who had first blood while trying to possess its secrets.
With pleasure.
Hello? Computer...?
Ojichan? Akira ojichaan dewa naino? Koko de nani shiteru no?  
Deceive us?
Clearly, the architects of this conspiracy have tried to keep it a secret. Not just from you, but from my people as well.  I don't intend to let them.
Seeing my home planet from space for the first time...
There's one thing I don't understand.  In three hundred years...you never learned to swim?
Jak'tahla?
But I have three hundred and eighteen days of vacation time coming. I plan on using them.
There is no need for concern. I am operating within normal parameters now.
My father told me I shouldn't talk to you.
Perhaps it would surprise you to know that I have often tried to imagine what it would be like to be a child...
Chase me!
Data... haven't you ever just played... for fun?
I have to go home now.
They all have slightly elevated levels of endorphin production... probably the result of the environmental anomalies here...
Very funny...
Hello, Data...
'his nose should pant and his lip should curl...'
Tricorder functions are limited due to heavy deposits of kelbonite in these hills...
Your android has turned dangerously violent, Captain... Considerable damage was done to my ship. He must be destroyed.
Take me down. Let me talk to Picard.
We're taking this ship out of here... this mission is over...
The Enterprise can be at your position in two days, Admiral...
What kind of concerns?
Captain, I wasn't expecting you.
In stasis. La Forge is completing the diagnostic.
You're looking well, Jean-Luc. Rested.
There are six hundred people down there. We'll be able to use the regenerative properties of this radiation to help billions.  The Son'a have developed a procedure to collect the metaphasic particles form the planets rings...
A coward... without the moral courage to stop an unspeakable atrocity. You offend me.
The countdown control has been transferred to the collector...I can't override...
We're about to lose communications with Starfleet, Captain.
Full impulse.
The purpose being I intend to shove it down the Son'a's throat.
We're still thirty-six minutes from transmission range, sir.
'Yew-cheen chef-faw.'
I wish there was a way to bring them back home.
Worf, you must hurry...
Captain...
Did any of the hostages mention a cloaked ship during their debriefings?
I don't see anything to suggest the Son'a have any interest in sociology...
Nomadic, collectors of precious metals, jewels...
What you're doing to my neck...
What I need, I can't get from Doctor Crusher...  Counselor, do you think it's possible for two people to go back in time to fix a mistake they've made?
Initiate launch sequence.
Admiral... what's the status of the Borg fleet?
Montana.  Energize.
It's Cochrane.
There must be some good people... even in this time.
But I had a little help. Surgical transporter. I used it to beam out most of the bone fragments from his brain.
He was so confused by what I was doing, I don't think he even noticed.  Any word from the Enterprise?
No. I will not betray my friends.
You're becoming more human all the time, Data. Now you're learning how to lie.
I am... grateful for what you have given me. But I still do not wish to be assimilated.
Isn't it better like this...?
We are approaching the Terran System, Captain.
It has entered Earth orbit.  Correction -- it is not in orbit. It is heading directly toward the surface.
That is a contradiction. The Borg act as a collective consciousness. There are no individuals.
Captain... we've got less than ten minutes before that Vulcan ship leaves the system. We've got to go <U>now</U>.
No... the door's too thick.
Entering the upper ionospere...
Passing one-half light speed. The starboard nacelle's running a little hot...
The inertial dampers are having trouble compensating... I don't think Cochrane built this thing for comfort.
They're getting awfully close... what the hell are they doing?
Main bus...
Jean-Luc Picard.
Where in the States?
Beautiful city. Used to be, anyway. I didn't think anyone still lived there.
Maybe you can tell me what he's been doing in that silo. We heard some explosions out there this morning...
What do you want?
There is no invasion...
What are you, an idiot? Didn't you see the red light was on?
No... but sometimes I feel that way.  What I meant was, I'd be willing to trade for the photographs.
You're leaving, aren't you?
I don't care if you're from France or Venus... just take me with you.
Signal the Endeavor to fall back. We'll cover them.
Incoming transmission from the Borg.
Life signs?
Captain, there are five Borg ships closing in on our position.
Target locked!
Incoming transmission from Starfleet Command. Admiral Hayes.
Report.
And if they succeed, humans won't make First Contact with the Vulcans tomorrow.  As First Officer I should be the one beaming down...
What the hell is happening, Worf?
To control the Enterprise, they'll have to gain access to one of two locations. Main Engineering... or the Bridge.
What are they doing?
They're connecting the conduits to subspace communications...
Try not to look at the stars... keep your eyes on the ship.
Emergency override!
Report.
Someone...?
Wil... Data was down there.
I remember it made me sick.
Good luck, Captain.
I believe the operation is over.
Spock, that was actually funny.
Pity they're retiring us just as I was starting to understand you, Spock...
Three months till retirement. What a way to finish.
Well, don't be too hard on yourself - we all felt exactly the same -
Jim, leave me - I'm finished...
Too bad we can't SMELL her.
For 27 years I have been Ship's Surgeon and later Chief Medical Officer aboard the USS Enterprise. In three months I'm due to stand down.
Was Chancellor Gorkon alive when you first examined him?
I tried to save him! I was desperate to save him! He was the last best hope in the universe for real peace.
What?
And now we come to the architect of this tragic affair, Captain James Tiberius Kirk. I put it to you, Captain, that you were seeking revenge for the death of your son.
You deny that your men beamed aboard KRONOS One and shot the Chancellor?
Get close enough to a man and you can kill him on "Stun" without setting off the alarm - of course you can't get rid of the body...
Klingon blood.
Thank you, Captain.
Your friends are late...
What took you so long?
He wants your obedience to the Brotherhood of Aliens.
When whoever it is makes their move, you won't be here to ask if he's the one.
Listen. No one has ever escaped from Rura Penthe.
Stand DOWN, Mr. Scott. All stop. That's an order.
I always wanted to try that.
Who is "US?"
Lieutenant, I am pleased to see you.  The Lieutenant is the first Vulcan to be graduated at the top of her class as the Academy.
Never been this close.
Where?
What the -
I am responsible for involving you in this. I will go.
The Klingons have a new weapon: a Bird of Prey that can fire while cloaked. She torpedoed Gorkon's ship.
Can we two have grown so old and inflexible that we have outlived our usefulness?  Would that constitute a joke?
We can send a message to Starfleet Command -
Sorry to wake you, sir, but Starfleet urgently requests any data we may have on the whereabouts of Enterprise.
Apparently they're refusing to acknowledge signal to return to spacedock, sir.
A computer canna lie, sir.
You can check the torpedoes visually, if you like -
That could take hours!
And if they're still in place?
Too far off. Very near us. Perhaps... underneath us...
A Bird of Prey canna fire when she's cloaked!
I assume command of this ship as of  0130 hours. Uhura, send to Starfleet HQ. Explain precisely what has taken place, and request instructions.
And they'd be right. We have no evidence - just a theory that happens to fit the facts...
I've pulled out my - uh wooden shoe and Starfleet is screaming for us to return to port.
Why?
It has the ability to consume organic material at the subatomic level. I can't overestimate the danger of Thalaron radiation, Jean Luc. A microscopic amount could kill every living thing on this ship in a matter of seconds.
Remember him?
Jean Luc, Whatever you were... Right now you're the man you've made yourself. He's someone else.
As a result the temporal sequencing was never activated. Remember, he was supposed to replace you at nearly your current age. He was engineered to skip thirty years of life. But since the RNA sequencing was never activated, his cellular structure has started to break down. He's dying.
But we do have one advantage.  He needs your blood to live. He might come after you first.
Starfleet intelligence was only able to provide a partial account of his military record. We can infer he is relatively young and a capablecommander. He fought seventeen major engagements in the war. All successful. Beyond that, we know nothing.
What do you imagine this is?
How long until we reach the fleet?
"For now we see but through a glass darkly..." He said he's a mirror.
We are passing through the Bassen Rift. The projections will return when we have cleared it.
We are losing dorsal shields.
Captain, we have lost ventral shielding on deck twenty nine.
At present he serves no useful function. Dr. Soong created us to become active and useful members of society. I do not believe he would have wanted the B-9 to live out his life in his present state.
But I believe he will prove incapable of performing higher functions.
What is our approximate distance?
It's about Data  I've watched him with the B-9 and I'm troubled. Data's desire for a "family" is very strong. I'm afraid he may be investing too much in the B-9.
Shinzon's Viceroy seems to have the ability to reach into my thoughts. I've become a liability... I request to be relieved of my duties.
But how can he? He'll kill you.
He can never know you as I know you... He can never touch you as I touch you.
Captain Picard, Commander Donatra of the Warbird Valdore. Might we be of assistance?
I'm afraid that drink will have to wait, Captain.
It's going to take some time to find out -- the data stream was rerouted through substations all over the ship.
I thought Thalaron radiation was theoretical.
He thinks he knows exactly what I'm going to do.

Enterprise. We are the Reman Warbird Scimitar.
So, human... you've met your better self!
I won't do it.
What's this?
Captain, I hope I don't have to remind you --
Captain, you have an Alpha Priority communication from Starfleet Command.
We have to assume he had Romulan collaborators.
She's not out for a pleasure cruise.
Sir?
But she's not the Enterprise.
I hope you'll forgive the darkness... we're not comfortable in the light.
Yes, I'm sorry, Captain.  There's so much we have to talk about.
I want to end the centuries of mistrust. I want to be your ally, not your enemy. As a first step I propose we eliminate the Neutral Zone and begin a free and open exchange of goods and ideas.
It's not quite the face you remember.
Were we always explorers?
And I'm not quite human. So what am I? What do you see?  Do you see a life you might have led? Lost youth never to be recaptured?
That's your life... not mine.
Our greater goal is more important, brother.
Are we prepared?
No -- this is wasting time.
How long?
How long until we reach the Rift?
What is it?!! Focus on your job!!
Join us, Commanders.  Now what's the disposition of the fleet?
How many Warbirds will you need?
Then I don't understand the reason for the delay!
Then perhaps you will enlight- en us?
You must learn patience, Commander. Do you know where I learned it? In the dilithium mines of Remus. Spend eighteen hours every day under the ash of a Romulan guards whip and you'll soon understand patience.
I thought we discussed patience, Commander.
Commander Suran, the games are over. In two days the Federation will be crippled beyond repair. Does that satisfy you?
Benny, God, take it easy...
Don't you think you should call a backup?
Mike, call for back-up.  Benny, you all right?
What can I do for you folks?
What do you do?
Do you have children?
Well, here we are... You go down that ramp there, you're sure to get a ride.
What was your last stop?
Houston found it in the extraterrestrial's suit.
It's real, George.
None. And there's another one in the area that's alive. I don't know if it's the only one. I don't know if it was left here by accident or it's part of an inva...
Why did you let it get into a populated area?
I've never been taken off an assignment in my life. Give me twenty- four hours and I'll have him for you.
Mrs. Haydn...
Is the man who kidnapped you there now?
Mr. Shermin, I'm hanging up now. If you want to ask me any questions, call me at home in a couple of days. I'm in the book.
Please...
Steering wheel.
What?!
What?
What?
No gas.
Are you from up there? Space?
Shit.
No, no... don't say that. Bad word.
Yes.
No... The closest...
I'd love to have a baby. But I can't...
Say it.
Will you please do it my way? You'll get into trouble if you don't. If anybody talks to you, tell them... I do not speak English.
Yes. I have a long ride ahead of me...  Goodbye.
Jennyhaydn.
Why did your ship land on this planet... on Earth?
The police shouldn't have started shooting. But you can hardly blame them. You surprised them. They didn't know you were up there. When they saw you, they thought you were here to hurt us.
It's bad.
Nobody knows.
I like this music.
You liked my singing?
This car will take me to Las Vegas. I cannot go back.
I don't want you to be hurt.
What are you saying?
Good morning.
No, they don't talk... We talk to them.
They are beautiful.
It will be human and it will look like this.  But when it comes it will know everything I know and everything you know. That is something from my planet that I want your baby to have.
It'll give you the different countries, how they came to be, what they are now, how America came to be, the governments, the languages... everything.
What will you say about us?
This is yours...
Would you put some of your singing in this for the baby?
The yellow one.
Well...
I love you.
Tell the baby about me.
Oh God, man... don't shoot me... My mistake... I'm sorry...
Slow down, slow down.
I'm telling you, you're going to find him at the roadblock, or right after, or not at all.
Why wouldn't he want to go through the roadblock?... What did you guys do?... I won't tell anybody.
Aghh... I'm supposed to umpire a little league game tomorrow.
Good... It looks like we might be the welcoming committee, so I think we should try and figure out what we're gonna do if we have to come face to face with this creature.
I know. She bought him a ticket for Lathrop Wells and put him on the bus. He didn't stay on though and they drove off together.
You have no conception of this, do you?
There's a good chance you could be wrong about this thing then...
I know what I saw. I've seen him enough times.
Hey, it's none of my business why you're chasing a retard... You want my opinion, it's the girl. She had to hold the guy's hand all the way to the car like he was a kid.
Easy, Eduardo, easy.  Preserve a sense of humor at all times.  Okay, the receptor rig... what I'm putting on your head... sends a signal to the recorder.  See we call it "being wired," but there's no wire.  You gotta keep the recorder close... five, six feet away max, like in your jacket pocket by the bed or wherever you're going to close escrow, know what I mean?
We have nothing to talk about, Lenny.
He's no concern of mine, as long as you don't talk to him.  Don't talk to anybody.  You understand?  Not with everything that's going on right now.
Believe it.  Now bring me the trodes, baby.  Come on, quick.
Hey, you going to watch or you going to do?
Cut it out, Tran.
I don't think that's a good idea, Lenny.
Faith, call me, okay?
Hi, baby.  I've missed you.
That's a good one, coming from you.
You have to get out of here.  If Tran catches you he'll... he's acting crazy.  He's doing way too much playback and he's getting completely paranoid.  He's such a control freak, he's even paying Max to follow me around.
Who did it?
You don't know what you're fucking with here.
No.
Just what I've read.  That the technology was developed for the Feds, to replace the body wire.  And now it's gone black market.  So, uh, do I get the deck from you?
Talk to me about costs, here.
D'you always have to dress like a fuckin' pimp?
You were lucky, Max.
You should feel like shit.
Hey, the last day of the world and you spend it in bed.
Faith OK?
Sounds like Tick's already celebrating.
Jesus.
He's got her up in the room, under guard.  And he's still working the party... acting smooth like nothin's nothin'.  So buddy... I say we work a trade.
Give him the tape.  See?  It's fucking brilliant!  The tape for Faith.  I know he'll go for it.  I can set it up.
2-2-0-3.  Got it.  Stay on her.
How did you hook up with Faith?
Well, it's cutting awful close to me.  I mean she was just here.
About what?
Buncha techno-perv jerkoffs.
Lenny, this shit's illegal.
What's his name?
What the fuck are you doing?
Are we having a bad night?
Destiny?  You living in a perfume commercial?  She's a hard-climber that dropped you like a used tampon when she got a better ride.
He knows what he's doing.  He's worn before... a lot.
The question is not whether I am paranoid, but whether I am paranoid enough.  You want to rub my neck?
Whatup Lenny?
What is it?
Shit!
Those two guys were cops.
There's a plus side?
It was a tough call.
Right.  That explains it.
What is that?
But I mean isn't he Faith's new-- 
Was this him?
Welcome back, sir. How was the vacation?
Agents Duncan, Mackelway.  Anything new?
Agent Mackelway.
The room key's in the car. On the seat.
Show's over, boys. Nobody home.
Dylan here.
You heard?
Ligature strangulation, just like his victims. A cord, nylon, you can tell by the indentation signature -- again, like his victims.  Look at that little thing and look at all the trouble it got him in. Should have cut it off.
We had to bring staff in from the whole county to handle this.
Be my guest, Agent Kulok, scrub suits are in the back.
There seems to be a discrepancy.
I don't mean to be rude, but...
What?
Calm down, Harold.  Okay, here's what we're going to do, Harold: there's a pull off up ahead, we're going to stop there.
You're going to miss it. Pay attention.
You have the photo from the diner?
Agent Kulok and I were in O'Hare when we heard.
That gasbag. I can imagine what he said. I'm not ashamed to admit that most of what I know about criminal profiling started with Richard Low. I have also, over the years, I admit, taken credit for many of his accomplishments. He was the most brilliant law enforcement individual I ever met.
I'm told you've asked for a Bureau cross-check of flight records to and from El Paso, Ft. Myers, Omaha, the Murman murder time frames.
That breaks my confidentiality stipulation.
This is a sexy case.
Doesn't fit.
Don't even go there. What's up?
What about the chat rooms themselves?
What's that?
Take it to the next level. What are his fantasies, what turns him on, what kind of pornography does he like? If he could act out his fantasies, what would he do? Imagine yourself one of his victims, realizing your life is in his hands. What is he thinking?
That's because he's a fucking wacko. Never met a self-promotion scheme he didn't like. What's he doing now?
I ever get like that, just take me out in back and shoot me.
I saw him on a talk show once, talking about these killers like they were his friends. Not the victims, not the families of the victims, he doesn't talk about them. Blood money, that's what it is.  Did he hit on you?
When you were his student? Did he come on to you?
There are Agency regulations about this.
I've been thinking about this.
Just routine stuff.
We got an UNSUB walking around with four feet?
You mean --
There's the Agency issue. I think Koessler may suspect something already. We're not on the best footing with him as it is.
Then there's the other issue.
It's okay to be wrong, just don't be dead wrong.
But why this pattern?
You okay?
It's quite advanced.
Okay, I'll unhook you. No weapon.
Bitch! Cunt! Please, please, please don't do this, Agent Kulok. You need me.
How did you know Speck was a killer?
How's the arm?
You did. You were with her when she disappeared, right? She took you to the mall or the movies, you turn around and she's gone.
Is he dead?
[You want to talk, Lionheart, or you want to take this a little more personal?]
[If you wanted a good steak, you should have gone to Omaha.]
This is a first. You criticized the Deputy Director to his face and you still have a badge? You must have some one-of-a-kind skills.  Why don't you just quit? I mean, you're not going to get promoted, not wearing this jacket.
No.
You have to put things in perspective.
You've been through worse.
You should call your Grandmother.
You like laughing at the misery of others?
I'm Mike.
Oh, God. That's two more than me. Tell me it gets better.
Anything?
Maybe it doesn't matter if he's a good dancer cause it's a slow song, if that's what he's afraid of.
You want to come with us to a party at the Chateau Marmont? They got a bungalow and lots of beautiful babies.
Oh, I'm sorry. How'd your folks take it?
...I heard it took four days to light for that shot...
A couple of high rollers like you?
On the table.
Huh?
Do you have anything smaller?
Do you ever perform out here? I'd love to see you.
Why not?
Well, who represents you back east?
I'm sure she'll call. Six years is a long time. You don't just break it off cleanly after six years.
It's a rebound.
Can I check my messages? I have a calling card.
You said there are advantages to being single. I want to know what the advantages are.
You're a comedian?
I'll have to come see you sometime.
Yeah. Nice touch. It's the logo from "You Bet Your Life", right?
Can I give you a ride to your car...?
Yeah, uh, I don't think that's gonna be happening any time soon... Listen, can I call you right back? I gotta take this call...
So the only difference is if I forget about her or pretend to forget about her.
So it's almost a retroactive decision. So I could, like, let's say, forget about her and when she comes back make like I just pretended to forget about her.
Thanks, man. Sorry we always talk about the same thing all the time...
Rob, I just want you to know, you're the only one I can talk to about her.
I don't think I'm gonna take it.
Do you realize how hard it's going to be to tell my parents? I still haven't told them I didn't get the pilot.
That doesn't sound too good for business.
Kinda money, huh?
I'll get a Dewars rocks... 
Darwinism at its best.
...What's the big deal? Everyone steals from everyone.
I'm going in. Will you be my wing- man?
Thanks, man.
You want to talk about it?
I'm such an asshole.
See, it's all how you look at it. If your life sucks, then mine is God awful. I mean, I moved out here partially because I saw how well you were doing. You got in the union, you got an agent. I thought if you could make it, maybe I could too...
You miss the pain?
It's kinda money, actually.
Pause it. 
You live in such a fantasy world...
Hi. This is Nikki. Leave a message. 
There you two are. I walked around for an hour with that stupid martini on my tray.
Excuse me. We're in a bit of a hurry.
That was Sue. We got two parties tonight. One's for a modeling agency.
Listen to me, baby, there are going to be beautiful babies there.
Listen to you. I got an audition for a pilot at nine and I'm going. You gotta get out with some beautiful babies. You can't sit home thinking about her.
Wear a suit, I'm telling you it works.
Vegas, baby!
Wake up, baby.
It doesn't matter...
Don't make fun, I think we can get some free shit if we don't fuck around.
That's where we make our scene.
You gotta do it.
Twenty... but I was down at least fifty. I'm sorry, I got hot at the crap table.
Let's go. I'm not paying for a room, and if we don't leave now we'll never make it.
It's just tough, after sleeping with someone you love for so long, to be with someone new... who doesn't know what I like... and you gotta wear a jimmy...
That was so fuckin' money. It was like that "Jedi mind" shit.
You did fine. Don't sweat her. We're meeting our honeys soon. You know Christy's friend is going to be money.
What was the part?
No!
Yeah, a good friend.
That was different.
He drives a carriage.
No.
Guys... Guys... I got it under control.
Oh, it's on, baby...
...we're not...
...You're just poking at it...
...honestly...
...you're so fuckin mmmoney.
...Yeah. But two's enough not to look anxious...
...Oh, who would jack your fuckin K- car? He's right, Sue. You don't need no gat.
...Sue...
It's on...
It is on.
...One fifty-nine, Two minutes.
The Don himself is coming to me tonight?
No.  You ask for too much.
You never think to protect yourself with real friends.  You think it's enough to be an American.  All right, the Police protects you, there are Courts of Law, so you don't need a friend like me. But now you come to me and say Don Corleone, you must give me justice. And you don't ask in respect or friendship.  And you don't think to call me Godfather; instead you come to my house on the day my daughter is to be married and you ask me to do murder...for money.
Understood.  I just wish I was doing more to help out.
What's the matter, Carlo?
Outside.
I'll think about it.
Good for ten men...
My business is heroin, I have poppy fields, laboratories in Narseilles and Sicily, ready to go into production.  My importing methods are as safe as these things can be, about five per cent loss.  The risk is nothing, the profits enormous.
No.
My wife was weeping before she fell asleep, outside my window I saw my caporegimes to the house, and it is midnight.  So, Consigliere of mine, I think you should tell your Don what everyone knows.
I understand, Michael.  But you must make a family, you know.
Accept what's happened, Michael.
Yes, but sons who would be professors, scientists, musicians...and grandchildren who could be, who knows, a Governor, a President even, nothing's impossible here in America.
I told you that it wouldn't escape his eye.
...a fine boy from Sicily, captured by the American Army, and sent to New Jersey as a prisoner of war...
Now that the war is over, Enzo, this boy is being repatriated to Italy.  And you see, Godfather...  He...my daughter...they...
I know.
Is that why there are more men on the walls?
Tom, you're the Consigliere; you can talk to the Don and advise him.
Has anyone been able to get in touch with him?
That's easy to say; it's not your father.
Maybe Mike shouldn't get mixed up in this so directly.  You know the old man doesn't want that.
The other families won't sit still for all out war.
Yes, even the shooting of your father was business, not personal...
I'll worry about Luca.  You take care of Sonny and the other two kids.
What about McCluskey?
Christ, Tom; I needed more time with him.  I really needed him.
Michael, what are those men doing?
Why do they bother him on a day like this?
You really want to know?
My Father sent Luca Brasi after them.  He tied the two Capone men hand and foot, and stuffed small bath towels into their mouths. Then he took an ax, and chopped one man's feet off...
Michael.
Michael, what are you doing?
Michael?
Michael...
Hello.  Kay?
He'll be OK.
Look.  I'll see you tonight, OK?
I don't think so.  You don't want to end up on page 3 of the Daily News.
I don't think so either.  I better go.
When will I see you again?
Why are you so cold to her and Carlo?  They live with us on the Mall now, but you never get close to them.
Send some bodyguards.
I'm glad you came, Mike.  I hope we can straighten everything out.  All this is terrible, it's not the way I wanted things to happen at all. It should never have happened.
Most important...I want a sure guarantee that no more attempts will be made on my father's life.
Do you pledge to guide and protect this child if he is left fatherless? Do you promise to shield him against the wickedness of the world?
Do you renounce Satan.
Do you wish to be baptized?
Let us fill up our Regimes.
Barzini wants to arrange a meeting. Says we can straighten any of our problems out.
You goddamn dagos.  I do you a favor and take Freddie in when you're having a bad time, and then you try to push me out.
Yeah.
Tom was telling me about his trip over. Made me laugh so much I got a nosebleed.
What? What?
Uncanny!
Hi Tom.
Now you know why Miss Sherwood always shows up for breakfast. It's not love it's the coffee machine.
He's drowning me!
Who? Oh, Tom, hello, how are you? We thought you'd disappeared. We were going to send out a search party.
I met him in New York.
I'm never going back!
You're a dark horse, Ripley. Engaged?
I have to go to Venice.
That's one job, you told me a lot of jobs.
I love the fact you brought Shakespeare with you and no clothes. Ermelinda says you wash the same shirt out every night. Is that true?
She can do that stuff for you. Anyway, just wear some of my things, wear anything you want, most of it's ancient. 
Without the glasses you're not even ugly.  I don't need them because I never read. How do I look.
I know. I write like a child.
Do you have any brothers?
Means we never shared a bath. I'm cold. Can I get in?
I didn't mean with you in it.
What does he say?
You've got to get a new jacket. Really. You must be sick of the same clothes. I'm sick of seeing you in them.
It's just there's so much to do in a single day.
Look, Tom, we've got to go to a club and meet some friends of Freddie's. The best thing is -- if you want to be a tourist -- grab a cab and we can meet up at the railway station.
Get undressed in your own room, would you?
She came to me for help, she needed money, and I didn't help her. I didn't help her. Now she's dead and it's my fault.
Esatto. I'm always planning.
Ha.
What?
This is Tom Ripley. Freddie Miles.
Come on, Frederico, do you really have to go back? At least stick around for the Festival of the Madonna.
Marge-maintenance.
You should watch that!
Hardly.
I suggest you ask Dickie that yourself. Otello's is on delle Croce, just off the Corso.
Most enjoyable. Herbert Greenleaf.
Could you ever conceive of going to Italy, Tom, persuade my son to come home?  I'd pay you. I'd pay you 1000 dollars.
Yes. What's the detective hoping to find in San Remo?
Tom.
I was sure we'd met, weren't you, Ted? This is Herbert Greenleaf's boy.
I never said that!
I have to find a birthday present for Frances. Perhaps you can help me?
Tell me, why is it when men play they always play at killing each other...? I'm sorry about Cortina by the way.
Well, one day I'm invited skiing, the next day I'm not, one day we're all one family, the next day he wants to be alone. You tell me.
Oh my God. Tom.
Is he here? Are you with Dickie?
Dickie?
What?
Perhaps I shouldn't go either.
That's a terrific idea.
I found Dickie's rings.
You've got Dickie's rings.
I have to tell Mr Greenleaf. I have to tell Mr Greenleaf. I have to tell Mr Greenleaf.
I feel as if you haven't heard anything I've been saying to you.
Peter Smith-Kingsley. I've heard about you, of course -- from Marge, and Dickie.
But you're going skiing with us Yankees, aren't you?
Everybody knows Freddie Miles.
Sorry, I wouldn't have made a joke if --
Show me the other one again.  I like them both.
Don't worry. Really. Don't worry.
No, I absolutely understand. Of course.
What?
Of course. Aunt Joan.
Dickie, are you with Peter Smith- Kingsley? I bet you are. My aunt thought she saw him.
I know the Piazza di Spagna. What time?
You've seen the papers, you know what a big deal it's been here. American tourist murdered --
He wants to know if you killed Freddie Miles and then killed Dickie Greenleaf?
I'm sorry. I was asleep. I must have fallen asleep.
How was it?
Meredith Logue. You were kissing somebody. Looked like Meredith.
What do you mean lied about who you are?
And don't forget. I have the key.
Dickie Greenleaf?
The telephone, the press, I've been, I'm feeling hounded -- do you think you could not give out my address?
Yes, sure, we did go to San Remo. That was months ago.
A few days ago.
No!
How much for everything.
Nah, this'll be fine.
Charles Palantine. The man you want to volunteer to help elect president.
If you talk to Tom, he'll assign you to something.
Why?
All right.  All right. I'm taking a break at four o'clock. If you're here then we'll go to the corner and have some coffee and pie.
The moon?
Huh?
Well, I don't go to the Plaza every night.
What hours do you work?
You know what you remind me of?
The singer?
Travis, you haven't even played the record?
Where are you going?
This is sort of high class...
What about the record?
Hello, Travis.
Alright, forget it if you're not going to be serious,
What taxi driver?
No, why?
No, no, it's alright. I'll have a big Coca-Cola -- without ice -- and a large buttered popcorn, and...  ...some of them chocolate covered malted milk balls... and ju-jukes, a box. They last.
Yeah, that's Blush-On. My wife uses it,
Well, whatever the fuck it is, she used it. And then the spray perfume. You know, the real sweat kind -- and, on top of that, get this, right when we're crossing the Tri-boro bridge -- she changes her pantyhose!
Yeah.
Threw on the emergency, jumped the seat and fucked her brains out -- What do you think!  What do I have to do? Draw you a picture?
For a fee.
Fuckin' One-Ball.
Hello.
Well... I guess so.
Yeah. From the likes of them.
What's your name?
Why? Who are you?
Fuck it! Fuck it! Fuck it! Fuck it! Fuck it! Fuck it! Fuck it!
...and after that Sport and I just started hanging out...
Who's a killer?
Why not?
You a scorpion? That's it. You're a scorpion. I can tell.
Do you really think I should go to the commune?
I sure hate to go alone...
Have you tried the telephone?
Nice talking to you, Travis.
No trouble with the Hack Bureau?
Honorable discharge. May 1971.
No.
Are you a Secret Service Man?
Hey, Sport. How are things?
What's the action around?
Sometimes it gets so I just don't know what I'm gonna do. I get some real crazy ideas, you know? Just go out and do somethin.
Hey!  Now there's some good news.
No.
He says he's leaving the island sir.
Well yes I suppose ...
John Mason.  ' Don't be shocked.  I don't have much time.  Please listen carefully  ....
Motor oil?
What are you doing?
Surprise, surprise.
You'll stand by me?
You'll be fine.  No matter what Leo Kubelsky says, you've got a hundred and seventy-five years of American law on your side.  Don't forget that.
Tell them Pete.  Tell them...
Dell, I can't write unless I'm happy, and I can't be happy unless I'm here -- and with you.  This is me, Delly.  Pete Appleton. And I love you!
Dad?
Yeah, well it's not everyday you get  news like this.  You're sure he's  okay?  Other than the  bump on the head?
Daddy, that's Luke, can you let him in?  I'll be right down.
Me too.
I do?
City hall?
You first.
You don't have a boyfriend or anyone... you know... like that?
I'm sorry.
Were we going to get married?
No... you were wearing that suit the last time we went out before...
You know, everyone's so excited about the Bijou re-opening...
What about a loan?  You could go to the bank...?
How do you tell those two apart, anyway?
It never used to be.  You were two left feet on the dance floor.  Like pulling teeth to get you to do a little box step.
I see...
Sir, that is true.
Luke Trumbo?  We never met.  But I'd like to think I know him.
Mr. Clyde you're twisting things around.  I wasn't masquerading. Luke Trumbo... Luke was a good man who gave his life for his country. I just... happen to look a little bit like him.  That's all.
Anyone who reads the newspaper is quite familiar with your... "accident," Mr. Appleton.  An accident which, conveniently, came hard upon your dismissal from United Pictures.  Tell us, this "accident" of yours, are we given to understand that it affected your memory?
All right, Mr. Appleton.  That was what you knew then.  What do you know now?
Yet you're contradicting yourself. You earlier testified that you attended a meeting of a communist party-run organization, yet you just said, under oath, that you were not now -- nor ever -- a member of the communist party.
Thanks for the lift, Cecil.
No wallet, huh?
Mother o'god...
Tomorrow afternoon...  ... oh my god...
Luke, you probably don't remember me, Roscoe Fitts, I'm the grocer here in town.
And I hear you and Harry are planning on re-opening the Bijou.
The days of the storefront grocery are numbered.  I plan on putting up a free-standing supermarket.
Why?
Um... Harry?  Did I ever keep the books here?
Forty-two was a lean year around here.  The war had just started... you were gone less than a month... and we were coming off a bit of a drought as I recall.  Not everyone could ante up the price of a ticket, and a chicken's as good as money if you ask me.  At that time, it meant a lot to the folks around here to be able to come to the pictures.
Well, son, I wish I could've shown you more, but this is all that's left.  Just this one reel that never got sent back from a picture we showed here a long time ago. Nineteen twenty-five, to be exact...
Thanks, Jerry.  Tell me something.
'Sides, car's right outside.  I'll be seein' ya, Jer.
Well, you've been wet to the skin. You must've fallen in.
That's me and my daughter Adele. My pride and joy.  Charms the fish right out of the lake, she does.
What's wrong?
Jesus.
Peter, their hands are tied.  You see that, don't you?
So, you're saying that it's true. You went to a meeting of a known communist organization.
Fought?  Come on, Pete, you ran the PX at Fort Dix.
You can't testify.
Don't say that.  There is no such thing as a blacklist.  Now, are you gonna play ball?
That was quite a show you gave them today.  We shoulda sold tickets.
When'd you quit smoking?
Why not?
Peter, I'm an agent.  I buy lunches and get deals made for guys like you.  That's what I do.  You're a writer.  You write pictures. That's what you do.  And trust me, you'll be back doing it again tomorrow morning.
Kid, you gave them what they wanted.  This committee, it feeds on names.  The more names, the better.  But for some high-profile witnesses, like yourself, any name will do.
Oh god, oh, god, no, I...
Thank me publicly?  For what?  For ruining this woman's life?
I haven't danced with another man since Mr. Terwilliger passed.
I can play the piano?
Sit.  Play with me.
Luke!  Luke, something's wrong! The film broke, and I can't raise Harry on the house phone!
Found me.
So I guess this fellow belongs to you.  What's his name?
Cat.  That's simple.  I like it.  Hi, Cat.
Please, sit.
Tim, I have to tell you something.
I'm... I'm not Luke.  Luke is dead. He died in the war.  He's not coming back, and I'm not him.  I don't even belong here.  This whole thing started out as an accident, and that's all it is.  An accident.
Did you think I didn't kn-kn-know that?
Will you help me, Sandy?
Ancestors?
I've been wanting a cigarette for the past twenty minutes, but I couldn't convince myself to stop. This 'tilling of the soil' can get a little compulsive, you know.
Thank you. It gives me something to do with my spare time.  There's a lot of spare time in Bodega Bay.  Did you plan on staying long?
You're leaving after you see Cathy?
Oh, hi!  Did you find her all right?
I would appreciate it. I've tried everywhere in town, and they're all full.
It's utilitarian, I'll say that for it.
Would you like some brandy?
Well, I don't suppose it offers much to the casual visitor. Unless you're thrilled by a collection of shacks on a hillside. It takes a while to get used to.
You needn't worry. It's over and done with. A long time ago.
What about Mitch? Didn't he have anything to say about this?
Then what are you doing here in Bodega Bay?
Mother!
They haven't harmed anyone.
Could I have a puff?
Why, it's just like air, isn't it?  When I grow up, I'm gonna smoke like a chimney! I'll be eleven tomorrow, you know.
Yeah, but she'll be hitting all that traffic going back to San Francisco.
Mitch? Why are they doing this?  The birds.
Why are they trying to kill people?
Mitch, let's turn back.
Mitch?  Do... do you think they'll be all right? In the trunk? Can they breath?
Where does he live?
And the white house?
The Brenners? Mr. and Mrs. Brenner?
The front door.  Isn't there a back road I can take?
Of course.
The little girl's name.
Are you sure?
Mrs. Bundy, you don't seem to understand. This young lady says there was an attack on the school.
I didn't even know there were many crows in Bodega Bay this time of year.
You cut yourself outside, Miss?
We don't have any fog this time of year, Mitch.
Gulls!
I thought I saw your car. What are you doing in town?
A what?
Oh. I see.
You did say birds?
Lovebirds, I see.
There's nothing wrong with those chickens, Mitch. I'm going to call Fred Brinkmeyer right now.
He sold the feed to me, didn't he?
And certainly pretty.
How long have you known her?
Perhaps I'm old-fashioned.  I know it was supposed to be very warm there, Mitch, but... well... actually... well, the newspaper said she was naked.
When?
Where will we go?
I don't know. We'll break up the furni...
Mother, get a rope!
They're gone. The same pattern.
Then you knew Mitch in San Francisco, is that right?
Do you think Cathy's all right?
No.
Would you? I'd feel so much better.
Please don't mess me up with bandages, Mrs. Brenner.
'Cause sometimes birds are attracted by light, you know.  Sure is a peculiar thing.
What's more likely, they got in the room and was just panicked, that's all.
These birds were...
Oh, yeah, yeah.  How old is she now?
Well, if there's anything else I can do, Mitch...
He's not home.
I wonder if you could help me.
Doesn't what make me...?
What did you say?
I don't know you.
What are you? A policeman?
What do you call your lovebird story if not a practical...
I think you're a louse.
That was the damndest thing I ever saw.
Ouch!
To bring your sister those birds. You said it was her birthday. Besides, I was coming up anyway.
To see a friend of mine.  Will you please be careful?
Just a few... just a day or two... the weekend.
Oh, no you don't!
So you came up to see Annie, huh?
I don't believe you.  I think you came up to see me.
Can't see a thing.
With... with Annie, of course.
Annie... Annie may have made other plans. I'll have to see. Besides, I can find my own way.
Hi. Annie had no plans, huh? I'm glad you came. Are you hungry?
Why did he shoot her?
You were just a poor, innocent victim of circumstance, huh?
And you didn't come up here to see her.
I have several jobs.
I do different things on different days.
On Mondays and Wednesdays, I work for the Travelers' Aid. At the airport.
And on Tuesdays, I take a course in General Semantics at Berkeley.  That's not a job, of course. I just take it because...
You look a little shaken.
They're probably hungry, that's all. This was a bad summer. They eat berries and... and nuts, you know, and the hills are all burned out, so they're probably searching for food wherever they can get it.
Have we still got power?
Mitch, if they hear the car starting... if they see movement...
Certainly not. Oh, no. Certainly not. This will be a full grown myna bird. Full grown.
They're both perching birds, of course, but of quite different species. The crow is brachyrhynchos. The blackbird is cyanocephalus.
I just came from the school, madam. I don't know about their brain pans but...
Yes, all right, I'll wait for you. Good-by. 
I like Bodega Bay as well as any man. If I thought... 
Help how? What do you want to do?
I only know we've got to drive them away from town -- before they drive us away.
How can we go on living here if we blanket the town with smoke?
Then fight back. Get yourselves guns and wipe them off the face of the earth.
I'm Donald Fettes.
Dr. MacFarlane said I should pay you --
Oh, you'll have ample opportunity -- ample --  Good morning, Dr. Fettes.
You must leave this house.
He could have been a great man -- a good man and a fine doctor, but there was always the shame of the old life and the old ways to hold him back -- and always Gray -- Gray to hound him to his death.
If he were only that. The man's evil himself. Some day you'll know him as MacFarlane knows him -- for MacFarlane he was to Knox as you are to him. That brought him close to Gray, he roistered with him and drank with him. Aye, and Gray even brought him to my door and my love. There is all that between them and more -- Burke and Hare and Knox --
And did you hear them speak of the porter who testified against Burke?
There's no standing between a fool and his folly. If you must babble your news to him he's at the Fisherman's Tryst. It's the inn at Pennycuik. You can use MacFarlane's horse and gig to get there. He'll welcome the ride back.
Dr. MacFarlane --
I thought only the best students were made assistants.
But Richardson?
But this woman -- and her son --
She came again today.  She wanted me to ask you if you would not break your rule and operate.  She feels you are her only hope.
Every street singer with a cracked voice gives tongue to that one.
I just saw Gray.  What was he laughing at?
I suppose one must pass through this purgatory to the heaven of being a good doctor.
You can't -- can't!  Stop trying to bribe her with childishness about white horses. Let the child stand and walk -- her spine's all right.  I know it's all right.
What do you mean, Fettes?
I know it -- I know it -- The moment I was rid of him --
Why do you want the white horse to bid you "good-day"?
Aye, but I still wonder how much.
He'll not leave the grave -- not since Wednesday last when we buried the lad.
I'm by way of being a medical myself.
I'll not do it, Gray.
You know what you want and don't want -- so that's an end of business between us -- but we'll still be friends, Toddy.  I'll be dropping by to see you and Meg once in a while -- for auld lang syne, you know.
You know something about the human body, Gray.
I set those blocks together, patched the muscles. I put the nerves where they should be -- I did it and I did it right -- and she won't walk --
But what makes a thought start?
Aye, Toddy, there is something in what you say.
What are you going here? Have I not told you --
Gray, I must rid myself of you -- you've become a cancer -- a malignant, evil cancer -- rotting my mind.
Well then -- I beg you -- I beseech you --
I have made you give me money, but you smile. Aren't you angry?
"The ruffian dogs, the Hellish pair.  The villain Burke, the meager Hare --"
Any attacks of pain since?
Believe me, Madame, if I were only a doctor, I would undertake this operation at once.  But I'm more dominie than doctor -- I've a school to run.
Fettes -- where is Fettes?
You've been with Gray again.
How many innocent people did you leave dead back there?
You think I'm crazy.
Lauren's father's involved. He bought the cops fancy cars, I don't know what else. It's a company called D-E-L-T. I think Lauren found out.
Where is it? This place?
That was a fucking hollow point!
What did they give you?
What did they give you?
We're going to play a little game called "Who's got the Scar."
Fuck. Me.
The scar. Which of you has it?
Yeah, no kidding.
You killed that cop Dutton.
No. You don't.
You know what Lauren and I were fighting about that night? She had a secret, wouldn't tell me...
It's ok, it's ok...
Erin. Who?
Erlich gimping around in his goddamn hot rod is not discreet. I've got reporters asking me how much he made. I've got the entire force looking at this case now.
Fucking crow.
Cause if you're losing your mind, I got a right to know.
An accident, Nathan.
What's with your friend there?
You want me to walk a straight line?
Why are there so many?
I think I dropped an earring.
Stay away from me! Stay away!
What about the people who are coming to the meeting tonight? Have they all arrived?
Yes -- that will reproduce the first- order terms. But what about the effect of the other terms?
You have faith, Professor Barnhardt
It was my intention to discuss this officially -- with all the nations of the Earth -- but I was not allowed the Opportunity. I have come to realize since that your mutual fears and suspicions are merely the normal reactions of a primitive society.  We know from scientific observation that you have discovered a rudimentary kind of atomic energy. We also know that you are experimenting with rockets.
I came here to warn you that, by threatening danger, your planet faces danger -- very grave danger. I am prepared, however, to offer a solution.
What -- what sort of action do you mean?
Such power exists?
Bobby -- I think it would be better if we didn't see quite so much of Mr. Carpenter
Bobby--! What are you doing up at this hour?
Oh, boy -- can I, Mom?
You think it can go faster than an F- 36?
You think they'll ever find him?
Wouldn't you like to meet him?
What does that mean?
Go to the movies.
Mrs. Benson -- this is Mr. Brady.
All you have to remember is, first find the common denominator -- then subtract.
My name is Harley -- Secretary to the President  I've been told that you speak our language -- that your name is Mr. Klaatu.
Naturally we're very curious to know where it is you come from.
You know about the United Nations?
It was a wonderful day.
I wonder if we ought to--
Tom -- I've been trying to get you all afternoon--
Important? Of course it's important. The point is we can do something about it.
Tom, you mustn't -- ! You don't know what you're doing! It isn't just you and Mr. Carpenter. The rest of the world, is involved!
You wait and see. You're going to marry a big hero!
Everyone seems so-- 
I want to know what he told you last night.
What is it you want?
I'm sure Barnhardt can arrange to hide me until the meeting.
It's only a few blocks to Barnhardt's.
I was.
How did you get in here? And what do you want?
No -- no, thanks.
Well, how do I know who you are?
Okay -- book him and get him fixed up.  Looks like everybody's goin' nuts.
How do you like Santa Carla?
Why not?
Burn rubber does not mean <u>warp</u> <u>speed</u>!
Well... we blew Plan A.
Should I run him through?
Did you see that sucker burn?!
So how do you like those maggots, Michael?
Where's Star, David?!
Look.
And these Archies should be over here with the Richie Rich's.
Bad breath?  Long fingernails?
I have something to tell you guys.  Not only is my own brother showing systems of being a vampire... but now I'm convinced my mother's <u>dating</u> one!
I wish they were vampires so I could nuke them in their hearts.
Dad!  Don't sneak up on people like that!
Thanks, Grandpa...
Grandpa, stop doin' the Indian Walk!
I guess so.  She said not to be late.
You didn't tell David?
He looks dead.
I'll hitch.
We are...
These are my dinner guests. Edgar and Alan.  The Frog Brothers.
Not funny, Sam!
There's nothing wrong with Max.  I don't know why you don't --
-- a job.
You're cute, Max.
But I don't think it's what you really want to do, is it?
Something the matter?
But you passed the test!
Are you following me?
Hi...
What's your name?
Ex-hippies.  My mom was one.   I came this close to being called Moon Child, or Moon Beam or something.  But Star's great.  I <u>like</u> Star.
I guess you're new around here.
Are you hungry?  Wanna get something to eat?
Now you and David...
When?
I have to talk to you.  Can I come up?
I know, I've felt it...
What!?  He <u>can</u> and I <u>can't</u>?!  No fair!!
You're beautiful.
Go away.
Lose the earring, Michael.  It's not happening.  It's just not happening.
No!  We can't tell Mom!  Please, Sam.  Don't tell her.
Star.
Sixteen.
Maybe dinner.
Whatever that Norwegian dog was... It... It was capable of changing its form...  ... when it attacked our dog... it somehow was able to digest... or... absorb it... and in the process shaped its own cells to imitate our dog's cells exactly...  ... This for instance isn't dog at all -- it's imitation... We got to it before it had time to finish or...
I've changed my mind... I'd... I'd like to come back inside... I don't want to stay out here any more... Funny things... I hear funny things out here.
Childs, where's that magneto from Chopper One?
What?
Somebody broke in.
Could have been anytime.  Anywhere.
I suppose... well, it's possible someone might have lifted it from me.  But...
Lighten your load, sucker.  You ain't the judge and executioner around here!
Childs!  That a fuse?
That's impossible, man!  Okay, Clark, out of the john where I can see you!
Somebody's taken it.  I can't find it!
I can get maybe another five or six feet out of it.
Load of bullshit.
Not the only one.
Maybe we shouldn't make it.
Anything?
... Guys as crazy as that could have done a lot of damage to their own before they got to us.
Gotta be from the Norwegian camp.
Couple seconds of an Argentine disco station.
Pure nonsense.  This won't prove a damn thing.
Looks good.
How long's it been?
What's...
How's that Thing get to the dogs?  I though we stopped it in time.
Sanchez...?  Hey, who...
What is it?
You jerking off or just pissed?
You know damn well what we both make of it.
What's happened?!
You hear that?
Now how did you get hurt?
... Thousands and thousands of people.  And sometimes we live in great buildings that reach up five or ten stories.
The Hall of Books.
I think we should go on by ourselves.
Please, just listen to me... Your mother would be very cross with me if you got hurt.  I'll find her.
Right up your alley, I would think. You are from the past, yes?
I'm the librarian.  I've always been the librarian.
Because you'll never die.
It's what they want you to see.
In for a penny, in for a pound.  Do you know that saying?
What's it all for?
What's your name?
And centuries later when we tried to emerge into the sun again, we couldn't.  Our adaptation was too successful.  We survived... we endured... for this.
And what of the Eloi?
What?
Why?
So you take their best...
You took her because she helped me.
If I can only find the right door... the lady or the tiger...
Next time then.  We perambulate here most every night.
May I help you?
Well, considering it is, in fact, happening, I would assume it's possible.  The retrograde orbit began in 2005 when the demolitions for the lunar colonies --
Talk away, Professor.
Dance with me...
Darling.
Alex, what is it?
Why do we have to race for heaven's sake?!
My God...
You're so pale... I hope you're not coming down with something.
We took a walk three days ago.
Heavens, look at that now!
... One day he'll be discovered by some future archeologists and they won't know what to make of him. The thick brow, so lacking in imagination.  The dim little eyes, devoid of curiosity.
Where's the challenge in that?
Look at them, Philby, all alike, everyone in an identical bowler hat.  Do you want your students to turn out like them?
I've been working.
Alex, nothing will ever change what happened, but --
That's absurd --
I hope it's a happy journey for you both -- and much as I hate to do this, moved as I am by your protestations of love, I'll be needing your money now.
And your jewelry too.  I guess we could consider this your first little bump on the road to married bliss.
You're up!  You must be feeling better --
Yes.
This is magnificent...
I don't understand.
It's always been this way here.  We work on the towers all our lives. When we're young we train to be planners or climbers or sculptors...
Those rocks, over there... they're the same... this is... Central Park.
Yes... a little scorching on the upholstery but otherwise all ship- shape.
As I recall the syllabus the name of your tutorial is "Applied Mathematics and Engineering", am I correct?
He said he traveled for two months.
My father has gone to a better place.
You know that's not true.
Sir, if I may --
How did you get hurt?
What did you do at night?
Hello, Mrs. Watchit.  You're looking in the pink.
We were forced to use restrains if that's what you're referring to.
We are not birds of a feather.
I'll say a prayer for you in Church today, Starks. Maybe the Gods can pick up where the medicine left off.
Becker, how do you sleep at night?
[Beat] You're his son?
I know. [Beat] I knew that when you came out.
I don't understand...
Do I know you from somewhere?
I'm sorry I can't tell you more about your father's death, Mr. Starks. Our own medical examiners determined only that he died from a blunt trauma to the head but that was right around the time the Alpine Grove's staff changed and I'm afraid we didn't have the best record system before then.
I think I can remember what's on them.
What'd you do? Snoop all over the place? You had no right. You had no right to go through anything.
William Starks is dead... [Beat] I've been to his grave.
How'd he die?
Then we need to figure out what happened to you. It's the only thing we can do.
Me, too.
You're sure?
Where are we going?
What?
It's ok. It's ok. Relax. It's just a cut. We can get it fixed. But we need to get you to the hospital now. How'd you get that?
So maybe Dr. Becker would know. [Beat] But, as I'm sure you know, the statute of limitations has run out for charging the hospital with any liabilities.
Ok fine. Tell me about it. Tell me about the future. 2004. What does it look like?
Why don't you help me?
Some part of you suspects -- even if you don't know for sure -- that what I'm saying is true.
William, I can't indulge these delusions, even when you're in this state.
I don't know when it'll happen but soon I think, you'll shock the boy and it'll wake him up.
What were you talking about the other day?
'Cause Lorenson's got her claws in it now. When she started getting suspicious about me was when they stopped using it on me. Women!
Becker does? Are you sure?
Because in my life, it wouldn't make sense for me to pick up some normal guy with a place where he's from and a place where he's going to. It'd be too simple. I probably wouldn't know how to handle a situation like that.
What's this?
I guess not. But, as of now, I never knew either.
You want anything special for dinner?
'Bye, honey.  I won't wait up.
Do you think you could ever think of a set of circumstances that would just cause you to haul off and shoot someone?
I'm asking you seriously, Sarah, a stranger?
Who's the nut?
Alright!  She did good!  Didn't she?
He said he took it to a motel in Oklahoma City.  He also says that at that time he met a man.  He identified you through a series of mug shots.  He also told us that you and Mrs. Dickinson seemed "close." Is that true?
Weird.  Got some kind of snowball effect goin' here or somethin'.
Now, for one thing, you violated your parole two days out.  And you know Judge Hainey.  He hates this sort of thing.  Once he gets wind of this, he's gonna blow sky high.  And then when he finds out that you're a possible accessory to murder and armed robbery, well, I think we can safely place your ass back in the slammer for at least the remaining eight, don't you?
Don't.  I'm married.  I don't feel good.  I've been sick.
Don't hurt me.  Harlan.  Please.
Louise, is that you?
I don't know.  Nowhere.  What are you doin'?
How?
I've always believed if done right, armed robbery doesn't have to be a totally unpleasant experience.
Good answer.  Same goes double for me.
No, I'm out of town.  I'm in... I'm in real deep shit, Jimmy.  Deep shit Arkansas.
Something real bad has happened and I can't tell you what, just that it's bad and I did it and I can't undo it.  Can you help me?
Tell me now.
And what's the mysterious code word?
Can I just ask you one other thing?
You wanna take it out of your wallet, please?
Front.
He already thinks you're out of your mind, Louise, that don't carry much weight with Darryl.  Are you at work?
Not this weekend, sweetie, she's runnin' away with me.  Hi.  What'd he say?
I've never had the chance to go out of town without Darryl.
I'll never make it... Can't we stop just for a few minutes...
I'm sorry, Louise.  I know you're all upset.  It's just I'm so excited to be out of the house, I guess.  I wonder if Darryl's home yet.
Jesus Christ!  Louise, you shot him.
Shouldn't we go to the cops?  I mean, I think we should tell the police.
It means shut up, Thelma.
Oh, I don't know.  I'm just nervous. I gotta figure out what to do.
You could help me try and figure it out!  I gotta figure out what to do, and you could try and help me.
Well, what's the big rush, Thelma? If we just give 'em some time, they'll come to us...!  Oh Christ. I'm just not ready to go to jail yet.  Why don't you go out to the pool or something and I'll figure it out...
Call him?
Will I be?
I know, Louise, but we're running for our lives!  Don't you think you could make an exception just this once?!  I mean, look at the map. The only thing between Oklahoma and Mexico is Texas!
That's puttin' it mildly.
I don't care what you say about him. The boy has got it bad.
I'm sorry.  I am happy.  I'm very happy for you.  I'm glad you had a good time.  It's about time.  Where is he now?
Thelma.
Just stop talkin' to people, Thelma! Stop bein' so open!  We're fugitives now.  Let's behave that way!
Can I ask you kind of a weird question?
Look!  Look who it is, Thelma.  I'll be darned.  What's he doin' way out here.
Oh, Christ.  I hate this guy.
What?
Boy, he wasn't expectin' that!
I'm warning you, Thelma.  You better drop it right now!  I don't want to talk about it!
I told you to slow down.  Hell, Officer, I told her to slow down.
And I don't want any more Wild Turkey, either.  It's burning a hole in my stomach.
You're not gonna give up on me, are ya?
No.
We'll be drinkin' margaritas by the sea, Mamasita.
Yes!  Yes!  Now what kind of deal do you think that cop can come up with to beat that?
We should head a little further in. There's not that many roads in this state.  I want to try to hit Mexico somewhere not so close to New Mexico.  They probably wanna kill us in New Mexico.
Hey.  Where'd you learn to shoot like that?
Shit!
What?!  What d'you think?!
Louise!
God!  It looks like the Army!
Go.
Where you goin'?
Yeah... sure did.
Isn't that just my luck -- I get caught for everything.
No harm, no foul?
Did you get my letter, Mare? The one about Ted?
...Not until I get a little something to remember you by.
What's the point? Let's face it, Dom, I'm in a slump.  Lately I've been feeling like... well... like a loser.
Mary again.
Whatever happened to Mary?
Well why don't you look her up?
That's it, I'm making an oath. I'll never procrastinate about anything again. Life is too fucking short.
Wait a second, I never told you that.
My Mary -- she's not in Japan, she's single, and she's got no rugrats. She does have a little gambling problem, she plays the football cards a bit too much, but she's a babe, a surgeon babe!
Shoot.
Tell her the truth about Healy! Blow the schmuck out of the water.
Oh God, I'm fucking nervous. I don't know if I'm ready for this, man.
Okay, sounds like you're all set. Just clean the pipes and it's a go.
You know, clean the pipes.
Why's that?
You bet your ass I'm right. You don't go out with a loaded gun, you empty the barrels!
Dom? What are you?
I got twenty bucks says you're full of shit.
Would you like a glass of tea or something?
The sawbones?
Why didn't you just tell her the truth?
Not in months. I don't even know why I bought the damn place.
Well, it was nice meeting you, again.
How'd you know that?
That's what I said, so I went out and got him a leash you know, one of those clothesline runners for the backyard. He's got plenty of room out there to dig. The kid's really blossomed. Now I can take him to ball games, movies -- you know, happy stuff.
Fine. Fine.
I know he's around here someplace.
Would you call that a portico or a vestibule?
And it doesn't cramp your style?
No. But the Boston Globe critic Jay Carr hated it.
No, forget it, it was stupid.
Urrggghh...
Don't play games with me, Ted.
I don't buy it.
Ted, I'm the kind of guy who shoots from the hip. Now I want you to level with me: Did you knock this skirt up?
You want her dead, don't you?
Nope. Never been.
Four kids, three different guys.
Hyperactive little fuckers, too. Tough to keep up with in a wheelchair, I bet.
Uh, that's okay.
Look, uh, I've been thinking about everything you told me.
Hey, hey, hey!
Look, you asked me to follow your girl around, and I did and I started to like her, and then I realized I just couldn't in good conscience do it.
Oh Christ... poor dog.
Really? But he's been married for twenty years -- they've got six kids.
No... just down the street, the Amigo Tower.
You know, I really should take your card.
Okay, Pat, take it easy -- don't do anything stupid.
Oh yeah, the plan was going along just fine until you showed up.
That stalkin' son-of-a-bitch!
That seems like a lot of speed for a little pooch -- you sure it won't kill him?
Ho-ly shit.
You little fuck.
I swear! I didn't tell her nothing! You probably did it yourself, you piece of shit.
Sucks. So what's up? You some kind of salesman or something?
Yeah, you wouldn't believe my idea -- it's a home run. You ever hear of Eight-Minute Abs?
How do you guarantee that?
Jeez, I don't know where you're ever going to find a guy like that.
It means you're too hard on guys.
Yeah, Steve. Steve was all right for awhile.
Have you been up all night again?
Neighborhood Watch? Is that what you call listening in on stranger's phone conversations?
So who's the lucky guy?
Good lookin'?
Then why you going out with him if he's a schlep?
Bundt cake?
I'm buying bananas tonight.
Knock it off, Pollyanna, just 'cause you're in love doesn't mean everyone else has to be.
Pat's an architect, too.
Pat does projects all over the world.
I've been looking for a guy -- not one of these South Beach pussies.
What's up?
I can't believe this is happening. I'm supposed to be meeting him in an hour.
Uh, well... not exactly. You see, I exaggerated a little there.
Oh, are you on the team?
The prom -- you going?
I'm sorry. I should've told you, he's got a thing about his ears.
Ted, I'm so sorry. Are you going to be okay?
And did everything -- ?
I can't believe he remembered you. He never remembers anybody.  You know I tried to call you for weeks after that.
Oh, Ted I'm so sorry to hear that.
Oh. So... what brings you down here?
Well you look great. Are you married, do you have kids?
Hey.
Well... why don't you move back?
That's right. And the good thing is you can do it anywhere.
That's really sweet, Ted, but you should save it for one of your books.
I, uh... I got it stuck.
OH FOR THE LOVE OF GOD!
Now I've seen it all. What the hell were you thinking?
Well, there's only one thing to do.
No! I was pissing!
See you, Warren.
We've been hailing the Groznyy for the last hour, Mr. Secretary. The Groznyy refuses to stop.
Yes, Captain, you may proceed. Clear your guns.
Jesus Christ, guys. What the hell's Khruschev thinking?
We're going to have to stop a ship eventually, show the quarantine's got teeth, or we'll prove McCone right.
We were just debating who had it worse, us or George Washington and his guys.
I'll do it.
My father --
Adlai can handle Zorin. He knows the inning and the score.
Hey, Mac. You're up bright and early.
You gotta stop 'em. We know it's Jack and Bobby's idea -- they leaked it to Lippman. The military guys are going ape, and they're not alone.
The sun came up today.
Every day the sun comes up... says something about us.
So which one of you geniuses can tell me how to explain ourselves to the world? How do we work with them if there's been a hard-line coup?
Don't forget, Mrs. Higgins wants to talk to you this afternoon about Kevin. You need to do something about this.
Hey, sport. You winning?
I guess you won't be coming home tonight.
No choice. This is going to cost lives any way we go. Do nothing, and it could be 80 million of ours. We have to get rid of those missiles.
Okay. Kenny and I only show for the meetings you call us into. Impress us. And do it fast.  You're in charge of keeping this quiet. If word gets out before we know what we're going to do, there'll be panic. And it'll ruin any chance of surprise if we decide to hit them.
I don't care. Cancel it.
I'm not calling and canceling on Daly. You call and cancel on Daly.
We have to try the blockades. It probably won't work. It may just be delaying the inevitable. But we can't just go to war without trying not to.
You'd worry that something was wrong if Congress offered you unconditional support.
All right. 'Cause you get armed boarders climbing into Soviet ships, shots being fired across bows...
We can horsetrade with Khruschev on ships. But it doesn't get us any closer to removing those missiles.
He's right, we can't rescind DEFCON 2. The Soviets will think we've gotten sweet on them.
I don't want to listen to this again.
We give them something. We tell them we'll remove the missiles from Turkey say, six months from now so that there appears to be no linkage. We also tell them if they go public about it, we deny it and the deal is off.
You must think I'm blind and stupid. I've already gotten the birds and bees from Bobby. The President doesn't have to double-barrel me.
-- you sonofabitch, goddamn it, I didn't drop --
Dangle a settlement, tie us down in negotiations, we come up short...
Jesus Christ, Larry, what the fu-- Larry. That's not even your name, is it? What's your real name, you fucking scumbag?
Nice piece. You come back here to cover your tracks, Geronimo? What's your name?
-- violation of the Major Crimes Act on an Indian Reservation is within the jurisdiction of the Federal Bureau of Instigation. I know that.
Those are two agents who went into a reservation a few years ago to serve a warrant. They were executed at close range. That one there is a police officer killed by the Mohawks up in Canada more recently.
Hey, hey, hey. J. Edgar would've loved you. He'd love anybody who joined the bureau to, what was it? "To enforce the laws of my country and protect her interests"?
Six rounds. 357.
Couldn't sleep.
Maisy Blue Legs place?
I got one up on ya.
Who is he?
I'd just like five minutes alone with the motherfucker who hung that flag upside down.
What'd she say?
Her oil pan is shot.
I'll sleep around a little.
Bastards...
It may have been Maggie's way of saying "get off my ass."
And it was full of water when I drove by here three days ago. Full. I mean... a river.
Never turn your radio off! I thought I was gonna find you scalped! Damn it!
Ray...
What are you --
No. Not just a track. You gotta listen to the trees, man. To the leaves. To this sand, you FBI's kicked all up. You gotta listen to the earth.
Grandpa Samuel Reaches. Heavy duty medicine.
Why does he wanna see me?
That's not solid.
Hey. Hey, those are my sunglasses you're wearing.
-- no. No offense to the old man. I appreciate you trying to help. But I put my ass on the line coming out here, man.
Five-hundred year old turtleshell rattle...
You had a vision. You had yourself a vision. A man waits a long time for a vision. Might go his whole lifetime and never get one. And along comes some instant Indian with a Mastercard and brand-new shoes, has himself a vision.
Jesus. Oil?
1868...
They got us sealed. What are we gonna do?
I'll have to see what the visions say about that one.
Is that like an hereditary thing, Magdelana, or can one take classes?
I desecrated it?
What?
Do you want a coffee?
What ya want?
Since I got a iron pipe put across my knees, man. Fight with three wasi'cus, ya know.
Get up out of the chair, and walk toward the backdoor, Richard.
They said I'd never see FBI again, and I'm livin' with you fuckers. I don't feed ya information on the Warriors, it's back to the pen. I don't do this, back to the pen. Your word against my word. Against a con Indian's word. I really got a chance, man, right?
Yeah, most likely.
Everybody's got to be somewhere.
Where did you see that?
He was in a 4G Negative dive and you were on his six?
If you were directly above him, how did you see him?
The what?
Some one comes up hot on your six, what do you do?
I'm different.
You don't have to kill it.
You ever think about killing another human being?
What he said..."There's nothing so exhilarating as being shot at without result."
I always wanted to fly... ever since I first saw a jet. I wanted to fly jets, then I wanted F-14's, then I wanted to fly off carriers, then I wanted Top Gun.
Well no...inverse order.
Danger?
Doesn't it ever bother you?
Lucky charm.
Just good luck.
The dark side. The price you pay for all the fun you're having. You knew about it, of course. Didn't you?
You look way out there. Out past the date line. West becomes East, all things change. You cross the line...today becomes yesterday...or tomorrow, I forget which.
You don't believe that.
Only when you're depressed. Then it passes.
Looks like a tie.
Long distance? I wouldn't do that to you. I'd at least talk to you.
I know exactly what you mean.
Hey, I never said I was a fighter pilot...I never claimed to think it was fun to be shot off the end of a ship in a storm. I can find contentment in a good book. I don't have to roar by someone at Mach two with my hair on fire. Sometimes...I just get happy being with the right man.
Well... What   is   it?
Yes sir. I do, Sir.
Yes, Sergeant?
OKAY... OKAY. BUT IF I LAND THIS THING UPSIDE DOWN. AND I LIVE. I'LL HAVE YOUR BUTT!
Bandit at seven o'clock low--solo. Take him. Pull on the goddamn stick, man!
THERE'S ANOTHER ONE UP THERE!
3,000 feet.  We gotta go, man. 3,000 feet, we gotta go!
What do you want?
Let me do the talking.
Why do you all have such funny names?
Well, I don't know. That depends.
Well, it doesn't just happen, you gotta do something famous.
It's not Cougar's place. It's ours.
The list is long, but distinguished.
So I've heard.
This is Evan Mitchell, he steers the thing.
Look at the weather! They'll never find us! We're near out of fuel. Put it down.
What are you doing?
You ever done this before?
What do these guys think, I made Cougar quit?
Come on, we're next.
Something bothering you?
STAY WITH HIM! TIGHTEN YOUR TURN!
What what are you doing? We're cover!
Relationships are a bitch, here. It's hard enough to concentrate ...under the pressure. Having a woman here is asking for it.
She's kinky for flight suits--said that she'd never seen so many zippers--played with them all night. The noise alone kept me up.
But, Skipper, Cougar's been picked for Top Gun...He's the best of the best!
Until last night. Did you see the moves I was making on that girl at the party?
COME OFF--COME OFF RIGHT. I'M ON MY WAY IN. YOU GO FREE, I'M ENGAGING.
Need a hint?
You like to work alone. I've heard that about you.
He's seat of the pants... Completely unpredictable -- nothing by the book. All over the sky. But I don't know, Skip, he's really got something.
He just won't engage. He can't do it, Skipper. He can't get back on the horse.
I've seen this before.
Yes sir..
Considering the company you're in, that's a pretty arrogant attitude.
I wasn't thinking. I just did it.
SNAPSHOT..MISSED HIM..
Twenty years' experience, I couldn't shake you. You may be a great flyer. I mean that.
I can take care of myself.
How do you feel?
Goose is dead.
How can I go on? I feel so... responsible.
What to the rebels want?
Tell me something; are all psychics, uh....?
What happened to them?
And if you wanna breathe, you gotta but his air.
I'll go encode your room key.
Well, Cohaagen, I have to hand it to you...This is the best mindfuck yet.
Richter, do you know why I'm such a happy person?
Perfect!...Get out of Sector G.  Now. Don't think.  Do it.
I'm with an very important client.
Blonde, brunette, redhead?
Ya know, Doc, you could have folled me.
I've been artificially implanted as an emergency measure.  I'm sorry to tell you this, Mr. Quaid, but you've suffered a schizoid embolism. We can't snap you out of your fantasy. I've been sent in to try to talk you down.
What about the girl?  Brunette, athletic, sleazy and demure; just like you specified.  Is that a coincidence?
Not since you lost him.
Hey, hey Tony.  Give the big guy a break.
I don't know.
They found us!  Everybody out!
They sell fake memories.
I did?
You shoulda listened to me, Quaid. I was there to keep you outta trouble.
Where?
Where is he?
He's not at ground level.
And you believe him?
Doug, maybe we should take a trip.
You are somebody.  You're the man I love.
Muggers?!  Doug, are you all right? What happened?
I don't know!  It had something to do with Mars.
The hell you're not.
Our friends, my job, eight years together, I suppose all this was implanted too?
But Doug...There's something I want you to know.  You're the best assignment I ever hand.  Really.
Nooo!  I would never do anything to hurt you.  I want you to come back to me.
To be perfectly honest with you, Doug, if outer space is your thing, I think you'd be much happier  with one of our Saturn cruises.Everybody raves about 'em.
I thought Cohaagen tortured you to death!
Hauser, you're lost your mind.
Why would I lie to you?
Don't be ridiculous.
By the way...ever heard of a company names Rekall?
Like what?
Where are you going?!
What reactor?!
Wait!
You stupid punk!  You came <u>that</u> close, <u>that</u> close!!
What?  Well, for chrissake, we could have made a stand at our place!  We had food, water...
What do you think?  Max firepower or...?
I'll bet you're sorry the college ever sent you up here.
You know, up the jeep trail.
No...it was eggs.  I did eggs.
You're gonna get us hung up.
Nothing.  But it sure might be a nice way of getting to know her.
What keeps us doing jobs like this is you dragging your feet.  I was up for going to Bixby.  I was getting excited.
She's got us.  Now, listen, the plan is: we have done our last job in Perfection.
We did it!  We faced temptation and we did not bend!
Well, whatever the hell happened it's just one more goddamn good reason to haul ass out of this place.
Probably up a pole starving itself to death.
Brother, we decided to leave this place just one day too late, you know?
Fuck you!
Slick as snot and I'm not lying.
Car's gone.  We just missed them, that's all.
Here's the plan...We don't <u>even</u> stop.  Ride like hell.  Tonight we keep right on going.  We'll walk the horses.
Prairie dog burrow...
Well...haven't seen a sign for hours.  Maybe it's long gone.
Run for it?  Running's not a plan. Running is what you do when the plan fails.  You're not even trying to come up with a plan!
Wait a minute...the Cat.  Could we take the Cat?
Watch your ass, shithead.
Come on, everybody!  We gotta run for those rocks over there!
Road's in!
Christ, Val, maybe she's not your type, but you could, at least, be civil.
We're here, Val.  Just tell us what you need.  Come back.
I'm dead.  Let's finish in the morning.
The con...!  Oh my God.
Listen, got a question for you.  Do you know if anybody is doing any blasting or drilling or anything like that?
Yeah, they're confused.  They can feel our vibrations, but they can't find us.
From Chinatown... Which is right up the street from the morgue! Where did you go with the body? What did you do with it?
Our own Colombian Connection... For three years... Three years of ball breaking detective work. And we put a lotta bad guys behind bars.
And the one on the right is the bullet you test-fired from Shu's gun?
Or this -- is this a significant difference?
Well then, does the defense have any witnesses?
Look, I'm a lawyer and --
We don't prosecute people because in the abstract they might be weak. Judge Brandeis said it best: Entrapment is a "dirty business!"
Come now. Did you see the gun?
Not the whole time, of course. I --
Kim's prints were all over it -- He admitted it was his gun, f'r godsake!
We have a full caseload, Rog.
Don't tell me where to work. I moved to New York to work for Edward Dowd. But I can't believe that Edward Dowd has nothing better to do these days than invoke exalted legal issues to get off guilty little --
At the trial, you said you were at your apartment that night. Alone.
...So what would we claim? He stabbed Duane Lindeman in self-defense?
I feel like I've been mugged... Guy scared the shit out of me. You made your point, Eddie... I'm relieved we're not taking the case.
So an upstanding member of the Aryan Warriors wouldn't paint them on. They take those teardrops seriously -- they're badges of courage, of honor. Only their most vicious killer elite get to wear them...!
Goddam it... the little punk bests me again, I get thrown down and lectured at and where the hell were you?
Eddie... it's one thing to compare Clyde Gruner to Jesus Christ. It's even okay to claim that Shu Kai Kim is just slightly holier than the Pope... as long as you don't really believe it!
-- Eddie...
I am. Eddie -- we've got nothing.
I think he hired Shu to kill Jimmy Chin... It wasn't a Chinatown gang hit -- Jimmy Chin and Art's wife were lovers! She just about told me...!
-- What?
...Jesus!
I've phoned every art supply retailer and wholesaler in the Tri-state area. No one's heard of Chuckie Roeder.
You do.
I need sleep. Some of us are mere mortals.
-- About what?
What went down?
No. You tell me, Shu.
I didn't need to know that a man I'm defending on a gang-murder rap is a prison soldier who kills over drugs?
-- How could I help you?
When you leave this place you're going out to dinner or a movie or get laid. Where's our bond? I'm going back to my cell and wait to die. So tell me: Where's our bond?
Did the police make any attempt to phone you, to follow up?
But now you've strayed from your area of expertise -- dope -- into street assassins. A subject on which you're dangerously ignorant.
Isn't it a standard trick to pack a line-up with men who resemble each other but look different than the suspect, so the suspect will stand out for the eyewitnesses?
To the best of your recollection, were you sober when you performed the tests?
-- Objection, your Honor! This case has no connection with any subsequent act my client may be charged with!
-- Can't Mr. Dowd find his own expert witness, your Honor?
Yes, Mr. Dowd.
Lou Sklaroff, Vin Badalato, Dave Montell.
You read Eddie's Chase Manhattan Bombing summation in the Leftist Law anthology?
Do the rival gangs compete for control of the prison drug trade?
By "takes care of," you mean "kills".
What color hair will she have?
Tell me some other things about her.
Go away. I am not talking to you.
Thank you, Bobby. A big score?
Here he comes.
The stuff we got last night.
No shit...  We killed a guy for baby laxative.
Let's ditch this place and party.
Your behavior is not funny and is wasting the time of the Federal Government.
It's 4:30. We close at five.
What the hell is that thing doing out there? You're not taking that body anywhere.
We got a phone, here, that's got a little ring.
Well, where are you going?
Can you tell me what their names were?
Phillip?
HE'S GONE.
And no one found the ring?
Where is the ring?
No.
No.
Came looking for a job with a friend of hers. Pretty girl. Could've been her sister.
You know, I never told anybody, but once for about three days, just before her time, Teresa's arm went completely dead.
That was really something.  That dancing girl.  What did it mean?
We're heading into a difficult situation.
So the sheriff had got an Uncle who's committed a serious crime.
Crushed skull. Probable cause repeated blows to the back of the head with an obtuse angled blunt object. Subject looks to be between 16 and 18 years of age.
No, Sam, I'm speaking plainly and I mean just exactly what I say.
She lived alone.
Esthetics are subjective, aren't they, Agent Desmond?  I'm Sam Stanley. If you ever need me.
Are you going to tell him about that "someone else"?
Do you think that if you were falling in space you would slow down after a while or go faster and faster?
Maybe I better start our homework.
Laura, I am your friend.
You're not mad at me?
I feel so bad. I had nightmares all night long.  They all knew you at that place.
How did I get in the house? How did I get into my bed?
But I love you, Laura.
Why do you do it, Laura?
Hey, Pete. Can't believe your tank's dry up at the mill.
Bob.
What about James? Can't James help you? You two are so in love.
Laura, you didn't come and see me today.
We were supposed to be together.
Oh, Laura.
Bobby killed a guy.
Can I take the car?
Where's Dad?
The Norwegians are coming next week and I want you to learn to say what I just learned in Norwegian. So you can talk to them. I want you to learn to say, "Hello, my name is Leland Palmer".
Let me see.
Dad?
Oh, I thought I saw you.
Laura. What's wrong this morning?
Neither is mine. And can't we talk about something serious for a change.
Leland...
Oh, Leland, sit down and eat you dinner.
Someone who knows how to clean knows where the object was before she started cleaning and then that object goes back to its exact same spot. Shelly, I know where everything in this house is. Sometimes on the road I mentally go through this whole house and picture where every item is.
That's one thing you are going to learn, Shelly, -- HOW TO CLEAN. It takes scrubbing, Shelly. There is no easy way. THIS IS WHERE WE LIVE, SHELLY.
He was accused of jury tampering.
We thought it was just.
That was our insurance company's recommendation.
That's the call that I'm waiting for.
You would not...?
In fact, you've just taken an oath that you would not commit perjury. You've just sworn to that. Isn't that right?
That's not my handwriting.
And why, please tell us, would you think that?
What book is that?
Yes, we've heard that. Doctor: you testify quite a bit against other physicians? Isn't that right? You, you're available for that? When you're paid to be there?
We've touched on this, his own witness has said...
It's a common medical expression, it's a crash program to restore the heartbeat. Dr. Marx cut an airway in her trachea, to get her oxygen, her and the baby... Ms. Nevins...
...and her heart stopped and she wasn't getting oxygen.
And what did your team do...
...A patient riddled with complications, questionable information on her, on her admitting form...
...to save her and to save the baby. Is that...
Yes. Yes. I think so. I hope you'll be comfortable. I'm putting you up at my...
These people play very rough. They don't want to lose this case. There's a lot of pressure they can bring to bear, I...
I didn't do too well for you.
Then what good would it do to ruin the reputation of two men, to help a girl whose life's not going to be changed in the least? You know what CODE BLUE means?
Dr. Towler; page 406, 'Contraindications to general anesthetic. Ideally a patient should refrain from taking nourishment up to nine hours prior to induction of general anesthetic.' Does that sound familiar?
And you wrote that...
...Page 414, 'If a patient has taken nourishment within one hour prior to inducement, general anesthetic should be avoided at all costs because of the grave risk the patient will aspirate food particles into his mask.' Is that what happened to Deborah Ann Kaye? She aspirated into her mask?
If she had eaten, say one hour prior to admission, the inducement of a general anesthetic... the type you gave her... would have been negligent...?
Yes.
Yes.
Thank you...
What did she say?
I'm sure it is, Frank: and let me tell you something. If we find it so complex, how in the hell you think you're going to make a jury understand it?  See my point? Let's talk a minute. Frank: what will you and your client take right now this very minute to walk out of here and let this damn thing drop?
What is it?
I need an extension for my case.
Is the Plaintiff ready?
Listen to me, fella...
I object, your Honor...
I changed my life today. What did you do?
Why?
What Hotel are you staying at?
I'm a lawyer.
Jimmy!  That's why the court exists. The court doesn't exist to give them justice, eh? But to give them a chance at justice.
Why don't you get some rest?
Well, then what are you doing here?
You do what you want. You want to leave... You want to go kill yourself?
You want me to tell you it's your fault? It probably is. What are you going to do about it?  I thought it's not over till the jury comes in.
Joe...  Joe...
Is it over?
Hello, I'm calling from...
Pardon?
We find that your subscription lapsed...
I want someone who was in the O.R. We're going to win the case, there's no question of that. It's just a matter of how big...
Who are you protecting, then?
I do. Who is it? The Doctors. What do you owe them?
My doctor told me that I got to move out West... that's when we filed in court. We didn't want to sue...
Well, well, well. Huh?
Hi, Mickey...
Sally Doneghy, now who is that?
You -- Listen: you said to me, 'if not now, when...'
You got the admittance form says patient ate nine hours prior to admittance.
You got a good memory, Franky.
John: gimme a cuesta-ray.
Today is Tuesday. What?
Uh... the admitting nurse...
What are you doing in New York...?
Dr. Towler...
You have a record of what happened in the operating room...
Stearns, Harrington, you know who that is?
Looks almost cold now, don't it?
It's an enemy sneak attack.  Let's get outta here!
We'd be the first to make contact with 'em -- see?
Hurry up!  Jump in!
I'm sorry.  I don't smoke.
Aw, he isn't that good...!
I might have recognized you without the beard.  And you didn't wear glasses on the 'Time' cover!
They've all stopped at the same time.
The troops are certainly moving in here!
I never noticed before - that's a cowboy tie....
Is that... machine...?
I almost forget when I ate last.  It looks so good.... You know, mostly I get my meals in coffee shops and restaurants.
He liked you ... I could bawl my head off!
They've blocked it!
Is it possible to go in right after the explosion?
I probably wouldn't be able to get to them if I tried...
That's what knocked the phones out, too.
That needle ain't pointing north!
What is that gizmo?!
This Martian blood...  Let's make a quick analysis and see what we've got!
A forlorn hope - but there is a chance.
There's one - there's the other, and we're right between them!
Thank you, sir.  If they start anything, we can blast them right off the earth!
Uncle Matthew...this is Dr. Clayton Forrester.  My uncle - Dr. Matthew Collins, pastor of the Community Church.
They don't do much of anything...!
They are living creatures out there.
Number three to. D.O....Number three to D.O.
I don't know, Bob.  I'm flattered and all, but I've got a kid, now.
I know.  We asked him to keep it kind of surprise until we talked.  Look, how about we get in touch your agent.  You still with Jerry?
One of mom's cups got broken.
Dylan, it's breakfast.  Not arts and crafts  What?
Anything other than the obvious bothering you?
Maybe.  Or maybe I shouldn't do this interview today.
Guess so.
Chase.  Why didn't Chuck or Terry show up?
Yes.
Like what?
These look quite fresh.
Ms. Langenkamp.  I suggest you go home and get some rest.  Your son is fine. He's been taken downstairs for further testing.
Someone's coming.
Rex saved me.
"...as soon as the sun was up the witch made Gretel fetch the wood and kindle a fire.  'We will bake cookies first,' she said.  'I have heated the oven and kneaded the dough.  Crawl in and see if the fire is blazing high enough now.' And she pushed Gretel toward the oven. The witch meant to shut the door and bake her once she was inside."  Dylan, this is too violent.  I don't know why you like these stupid old tales.
This is going to give you nightmares.
Tomorrow night.
Who?
And...what's the man doing?
Do you have to die to see God?
In what, a romantic comedy?
Must've read about the funeral.  Sick mother.  That's the last thing you need right now, I'm sure.
What...happened?
A man, or a boy with a deep, y'know, Freddy voice.
Holy...
Studio B.
Yeah, Julie, I'm sorry.  I just thought...there was an earthquake, I think.  Little one, but...
I'll call the cops for you.  You've got the number on the fridge, right?
No, Rex is not going to die.  Julie, you know where the sewing stuff is, don't you?
Captured?  How?
Me?  Why me?
Uh...sure...when?
Can I get you something to drink?
You may not like what you hear.
Phil, he's not looking inside.  He's just striking out at the world.
Oh I was walkin' down Lime street one day...
A pretty young maiden she happened my way...
So to all you sailors who've fought wind and whale...
Come in.
Well, that's all part of it.
Why didn't you drop any sail?
Make us proud.
I thought we'd find a store, get you fixed up and then get you some lunch.  That sound good?
What the "Bowsprit Affair"?
I walked in on my parents one time. It was only like eight o'clock and they were in bed and I thought that was kinda weird so I just walked in.
Where you going?
I doctored my grades so I'd make the cut.  I'm a moron, okay?  You satisfied?!
That we're going back.  I don't want it to end.  I don't want to be what I was when I left.
I thought this was your dream come true.
Why then.
Hey, shut up will ya?
Is it true Phil?
What the hell is going on?
Good.
It works?
My brother.  He fell out of the old beech tree.  Broke his neck.  I was on a camp out.  They started going at it, throwin' things, a real knock down...  They didn't find him 'till the next morning.  They didn't even know why he was up there.
I can't go in there.
Hold her steady into the wind. Southwest by west.
Ah... Northeast... sir.
You all right?
Shouldn't we turn away?
Does Phil know how you guys feel?
Chicken is a fool's game captain.
Is that what you were trained to do?
Then what do you think he was trying to do.
Well, we thought we'd drop in and see if you were all still in one piece.
Spying?!
Well, what does it have to do with? Us?
Who is it Philip?
Son-of-a-bitch.
Jesus.  She's got guns.
Yeah, well you're really gonna have some bad dreams if we find out you didn't.
What's your problem?
Don't ever call me stupid.
Damn, Porkchop, you sound just like a guy who ain't never seen a pair.
I don't.
This isn't just a story!!  It's history made allegory.  It is a philosophical handbook for life!  It holds the secret of this very voyage.
What do you think?
If he's a Cuban, Castro wears a dress.
You gotta be kidding?  He's a human chum line!
What are we supposed to talk about?
No, sir.
I have arranged to host a good will cruise for the Dutch students of the local school there.
I'm not gonna kill it.
Swing up, son.
I can't be sure.
For killing a dolphin.
Yes, that's true.
I used to helm a school ship.  A long time ago.
Easy for you to say.
Everybody knows why she went over Tod.  You jibed the boat.
I can dig this music... But not that singer.
Bobby Peru grab you now... Hold you tight... Feel everythin' in you now... Stay quiet... Say "fuck me" and then I'll leave.
Let's go by Rosarita's. You been there yet?
This your car?
They look like a bunch of good ol' boys to me. I guess it's oil money, huh?
Couple grand or more'd give you two a leg up. Get you to the west coast, Mexico, most anyplace, with a few dollars in your jeans. I got it figured good, Sailor.
...But DAMN man... This better go smooth.
Ain't never had no girl pull a blade on me.
That's right... Could have a bad accident, though... before... durin'... or after a hold-up...
Gas?
Club Zanzibar.
About. Where Lafitte crosses over Galvez Highway. State Road 86.
Hell, that rings a bell. Someone told me somebody lookin' like her was at the Nothin' Fancy yesterday.
It's none of my business, but when are you and Marietta gonna tie the knot? I always wondered why you never did.
Alright... By all means. Make yourselves at home.
I thought you two were in Austin, Texas. Or Takes-us, as they say in these parts.
So, it's back to the islands.
Oh, many things...
That is my permiso.
Mr. San Pedro Sula's authorized to carry a .45.
If your neighbors didn't mind, how'd you get put out of business?
The Good Witch...
Only that it's supposed to be a pretty poor sight since the hurricane came through last year.
Would you like to enjoy a martini with us?
Gotta admit, you guys are -  two in four dozen.
I forgot to show you this. The gentlemen that gave this to me said you'd recognize it. Said he wanted it'd be 'bout the last thing you ever saw in this life.
Maybe I was there, but I didn't see anythin'. All I know's that trash killed a man with his bare hands. Hands which are now prob'ly all over my baby!
Really, Marietta, you got more scenarios swimmin' around in your brain than Carter got pills. Try to take it easy. Go over to Myrtle Beach for a few days.
Let's head for Texas and see if we can pick up the trail.
I'll pack my things and meet you downstairs.
Nothin', honey.  Mama's just actin' strange.
My daddy ain't never killed nobody, has he, mama?
Hey, my snakeskin jacket... Thanks, baby... Did I ever tell you that this here jacket for me is a symbol of my individuality and my belief in personal freedom?
Well, I was thinkin' about smokin' actually... My mama smokes Marlboros now, used to be she smoked Kools? I stole 'em from her beginnin' in about sixth grade. When I got old enough to buy my own, I bought those. Now I've just about settled on Mores, as you probably noticed? They're longer.
That's true. Uncle Pooch wasn't really an uncle. He was a business partner of my daddy's? And my mama never knew nothin' about me and him - that's for damn sure. His real name was somethin' kind of European, like Pucinski. But everyone just called him Pooch. He came around the house sometimes when Daddy was away. I always figured he was sweet on mama, so when he cornered me one afternoon, I was surprised more'n a little.
You're terrible crude sometimes, Sailor, you know?
Just you. Uncle Pooch never acted strange or different after. And he never did anything else to me. I always got a nice present from him at Christmas, like a coat or jewelry?
Wouldn't it be fabulous if we somehow stayed in love for the rest of our lives?
I just think about things as they come up. I never been much of a planner.
Musta been a lesson tellin' ya it was the wrong time... What did you do, your mama find out?
...I hope you appreciate my spendin' six hundred dollars, not countin' what it cost us to get here and back... This man's the best damn abortionist in the South.
It was my cousin, Dell, done it? His folks used to visit with us summers.
Actin' funny how?
When he was about seventeen, he startin' losin' his hair.
He's twenty-four now? A year older than you? And must be 'bout bald.
Sailor!
Her face was half-pushed into the pillow, and she looked back over her shoulder at me and said, 'I won't suck you. Don't ask me to suck you.'
I suppose so. She knew I was bound to see you soon as you was sprung, but I don't figure she counted on us takin' off together like this... I guess this means you're breakin' parole, then?
Okay, manslaughterer who's broke his parole and got in mind nothin' but immoral purposes far's you're concerned.
Life is a bitch and then you marry one.
What it says on the bumper sticker up front. On that pickup.
What's that, honey?
Yeah, well listen to this... Radio said back in the 1920s a I-talian doctor figured out that if, say, a fella got his nose cut off or bit off in, say, a barfight or somethin', they'd sew one of his forearms to his nose for a few weeks... Then put leeches on it.
Huh?
My God,  it better be, darlin', cause it'd be the last... What time is it?
I really do think it's the best night of my life.
Well, she ain't talked to nobody and ain't nobody spoke to her that I could tell. What you make of that?
Honey, I'm sorry. It wasn't nothin'. Come on and get up and we'll take off.
You want me to drive for a stretch? Give you a chance to rest.
What's that, peanut?
It's a comfortin' idea.
Sailor, what are we gonna do?
Let's get ahold a' her quick.
I can't take this, Sailor. She's dyin' right in front of our eyes...
Now what?
You find any work?
He's the kind liked it.
How can you say that, Sailor?
I'm fine, mama. I just wanted to tell you not to worry.
If you mean Sailor, mama, yes I am.
Need me for what, mama? I'm perfectly fine, and safe, too.
No, mama, I'm in Mexico, and we're about to get on an airplane to Argentina!
Lula? I love you, baby. I just want you to be all right.
I'm goin', mama. No way I can't go.
Course I am, mama.
Oh God! What does that mean?
Oh yeah - sure... okay.
Have it your way... But you want it.
What do you want me to do about it?
Get rid of him?
Explain it... I told you.
Shoot Sailor in the head with a gun... Now I'm beginning to get it... You want me to shoot Sailor in the head with a gun.
Through the forehead?
I'm gonna take your silence as a "yes"...
Shhhh... It's all right... Also, I either take you or that pretty daughter of yours to bed.
Put your shoulders back.
You got nice tits.
That's just another part of the price to pay.
Where we goin'?
I know... I remember.
What he means is, it's difficult to distill the essence of a book sometimes. It lives in the mind.
He's fine. He's narrating.
Oh, well, that's just it. She's been coming down here, every half hour or so, to, sort of, check on me. If I'm not here, she might... call the police or... something.
It's the Chancellor.
Emily?
Oh. We're picking her up. Downtown.
Mm.
You didn't actually purchase this car, did you. Trip??
Trip??
Left you...? Who? Emily?
He is. Take my word for it.
Not Curtis.
Groom. Named Claudell. And his mother blames Vernon for his death.
That was good.
You stay there.
Kidnapped? By who?
Which is?
So tell me about you and the Chancellor.
Jesus. There must be two dozen windows on that thing. How are we supposed to find his?
Oh, Christ, don't start on ol' Gran or we'll leave you here.
Shut up, James.
The hood jumper?
It's cool, Jeff. Really.
Spiro T. Agnew was vice president, I believe.
I've been trying to finish a book...
Is that in my chart?
I know.
Who the hell is that?
Yes. But that's not why I called...
It was my mother's. She won it in a penny arcade in Baltimore when she was in Catholic school.
Are you and Hannah seeing each other, James?
Huh? Oh. Son of Fury. With Tyrone Power and Frances Farmer.
Listen, James, about this afternoon. In workshop. I'm sorry. I think I let things get a bit out of control.
Is that really it?
They're glass. The buttons.
Do you have a mirror? It's the best way to see if someone's breathing.
Trust me, James, when the family pet's been assassinated, the owner doesn't want to hear one of her students was the triggerman.
That's a big trunk. It fits a tuba, a suitcase, a dead dog, and a garment bag almost perfectly.
Oh. So. Is -- is your friend Crabtree -- is he -- gay?
Thank you.
Oh.
Huh? Oh, no. This isn't Emily's. I just write in it.
Want me to get that?
But... ?
And... and before that. Did I do anything? Anything bad?
Humboldt County?
I'm telling you what I was told by my uncle. And he should know. He ran half a dozen men's clubs in Baltimore before he skipped town on a bad debt.
Maybe she didn't come here.
Relax. Emily hasn't carried a house key since she was twelve years old. And your hips are as slim as hers.
Okay, James, I wish you hadn't shot my girlfriend's dog. Even though Poe and I weren't exactly what you'd call simpatico, that's no reason for him to take two in the chest. Still, the fact remains that I'm the one who took you up into the Chancellor's bedroom. I'm the one who has to take the blame. I don't know what the hell I was thinking.
Because you act like a goddamn spook all the time. Not to mention the fact that every last one of them is jealous of you.
You're lying.
Want a bite?
Professor Tripp...?
Me? Sure. Why?
He's going with me. You take Crabtree. And his friend. All right?
James. This is my editor, Terry Crabtree.
I've been re-reading Arsonist's Daughter. It's so beautiful, Grady. So natural. It's like all your sentences always existed, just waiting around in Style Heaven, or wherever, for you to fetch them down.
Hannah, are you telling me you don't know where James Leer lives?
All right. Take him to my place. He can crash on the sofa.
Jesus.
Crabtree? He doesn't even know James.
The aunt, Hannah. Where did you take James that day?
I need to talk to you.
You go first.
I'm sure.
Has he asked to see the book yet?
And? Are you going to tell him?
Well...
Who's gun is that?
You heard? How?
Your fingerprints were all over the bedroom.
I believe you. I believe you want to be with me. But this is not just about me anymore.
What's he doing out there?
And what do you think you might have said?
I'm through improvising.
I guess you have to go on faith.
You mean because his career's ruined and all?
Walter?
Grady?
Oh?
What is it, Grady?
No.
Oh, right. Yeah, that's true. He used to rub all kinds of things on it. Paprika. Ground lamb.
Yo, Traxler.
What made you pull out that old thing?
And?
She's in Philadelphia seeing Linda Aahby. The neurologist.
Nothing's wrong. They went to Wellesley together.
Well, there's always people you don't know at these things, but I can't say there was anybody particularly suspicious... Wait. There was one guy. Tiny fella. Claimed to be a jockey.
Hardapple?
We figure the perpetrator let him out. He's blind and we figure he just wandered off and got run over.
No, the dog.
George Sanders?
Well, Q certainly will. And, given that he will be addressing 500 people in little over an hour...
You look good, damn good, considering you're an old man now!
Oh man, that kid takes himself real serious.
Law says I can't come within one hundred feet of where children congregate. I figure the distance from my window to the school is one hundred and twenty. Make a bet?
I should go. Your sister worries, and when she worries she yells.
It's my own design. You won't find another table like it in the world.
She was going to throw it out, wasn't she? Just toss it like a scrap of wood.
Ah, come on.
The important thing is that you and Annette need to talk. She needs to see you, and you need to see her.
Carlos, can I ask you something?
What do you mean?
Try.
Don't you have friends?
What's up?
I think you do.
Sure they do. But outside they've got trees around them. The trees shade them from the sun. Of course, the plants enrich the soil around the trees. One of nature's symbiotic relationships.
Neither do I.  What's the one with the woodsman?
You don't know?
So. How are you adjusting?
No.
Banished... yeah.
What?
What's her name?
Walter?
No.
That's right, you did.  Have you made any friends there?
Is it just my cheery personality that makes your skin itch?
How do you define it?
Then how do you know if your patients are getting better?
I want to be normal!
Fuck you, Rosen!
Go home, Walter.
Please don't do it again.
I'd like you to close your eyes.
To relax.
No. When I say the word "pretty," when I say the word "pleasure," what is the earliest memory you see?
And what are you doing?
Don't ever do that again.
I'm only asking questions.
What else?
You felt pleasure.
It's going to take time, Walter.
You don't hang out with the other guys.
Are you?
Doesn't it get noisy?
So... what's your dark secret?
No you're not.
Tell me about it.
Did I say something wrong?
Hey, there.
So, what did you do?
It's not what you think.
Depraved? My mistake.
I'm sorry, Walter.
My father took me fishing here when I was a kid. He could name every fish in the lake. And for every fish he named, he had a fishing story. I hated fishing, but I loved his stories.
Is it their innocence? Their beauty?...
They seduce you?
You know, this is crazy.
All three -- in chronological order.
I love my brothers.
Are you serious?
We should live together.
Don't do that.
Goddamnit!  D'you tell him we need it right now?
Right through the brainpan.  Deader'n dogshit, boss.
You done impressing yourself, ace?
You got it?!  You got it?
Nice shot, Lins.
Bud!  Hippy's on the bitch-box.  It's a call from topside.  That new company man.
Lord Almighty.
Okay, Jammer.  No problem.  You stay right here. I have to go there to the end... you'll see my lights.  We'll stay in voice contact.  Just hold onto the rope.  Five more minutes.  Okay?
You never did like being called that, did you?
I can't believe you were dumb enough to come down.  Now you're stuck here for the storm... dumb, hot-rod... dumb.
I think you were worried about me.
I haven't worn mine in months.
What happened?
But you think it's something else.  What?  One of ours?
What's the scoop, ace?
All I'm saying is when you're hanging on by your fingernails, you don't go waving you arms around.
He's got the shakes?
I think it likes you.
You owe me one, Virgil.
Well, that's that.
Okay... okay.  We gotta get you out of here.
No, Bud, no... not you.
Hey, you come on my rig, you don't talk to me, you start ordering my guys around.  It won't work.  You gotta know how to handle these people... we have a certain way of doing things here.
Just get around so your lights are on the hatch.
What's the matter with you?
Come on, man.  What else could it be?
Go to the infirmary... get the cart .. oxygen... de-fib kit... adrenaline in a... ten cc syringe... and some... heating blankets. You got all that?
Is that it?  Is this right?
'Fish'?
Hafta... go on to... the moonpool.  Only way.
You better not say you missed that.
I think they're from 'you know'.  Some place that has similar conditions... cold, intense pressure.  No light.
Are we talkin' little space friend here?
Cab One, radiation readings?
You've got some huevos bringing this... thing... into my rig!  With everything that's been going on up in the world, you bring a nuclear weapon in here?  Does this strike anyone as particularly psychotic, or is it just me?
Hey!
Stand by on the ROV.
You boss is having a full-on meltdown.  Guy's fixing to pull the pin on fifty kilotons and we're all ringside!
Would we see the flash?
I'd like to find a place where I can get some peace and rest, maybe around here somewhere. I'd like to try...
But where are you going?
Up until now, Dad, I've been the one who hasn't wanted to marry him.
It's already two hours... What are we going to do?
It couldn't have come from anywhere else. At least, somewhere from that vicinity... But I really can't understand it. Contraband cigarettes on that island! It's the first time that ever happened.
Have you decided?
As far as I'm concerned, I think she's alive... Why, even this morning... that business about the shark... it wasn't at all true.
Nothing... nothing at all!
I think that you might go and have a look yourself.
Have you read it?... They're asking for anyone with information to get in touch with them.
But sooner or later we've got to end this relationship. And it's better to do it right now.
No, I'm sure it won't. Move over there. Let's make believe nothing happened. And when we get to the next station, get off.
And you leave me here all alone... in this hotel room...
But you know it already. Why must I tell you?
Then I'll see you later.
Sandro ...What's the matter?
No, Sandro... Please...
No, Sandro... We should go. Besides, we haven't been in touch with anybody. Not even with Anna's father. We should have at least sent a wire or telephoned... let's be fair, he must be feeling awfully lonely.
Sandro, I'm not coming down.
Well, with a shark running loose around the place, I for one won't get aboard that raft! They'll have to catch it first. I want to see it right here before my feet, dead or alive.
But where did you finally end up?
It's divine!
Do you consider that a compliment?
My childhood, instead, was a very sensible one.
Patrizia... Patrizia ... Where's Ettore?
Patrizia, I'm afraid.
Now what do I have to do to be left in peace?
Looks like the weather is changing.
But how can you carry on a discussion in this heat?
Let's see you dive from the top of those rocks, Giulia. That would be really sensational.  Come on, Giulia ... your life is much too circumscribed.
Where is she going?
The trouble with you is that nobody can speak to you, that's all.
It's strange how anxious women are to display themselves. It's almost a natural inclination.
They tell me you have a lot of trouble at home. Is that right?
I work there but I'm really a stranger.
And who is she? Does she work in Catania?
We have a radio like this, too.
And why wouldn't we have one like this?
Certainly a radio this small is very practical. It's especially useful for... I don't know... for traveling.
Music, of course. To get a sweetheart, one has to look around, but to get a radio, all you have to do is buy one.
Thank you.
Listen, Patrizia... The Marshal says there's a current that passes by here and ends up at another island... I don't know which... He wants to send one of his men over to have a look... One never knows... Do you mind if I ask Raimondo to go with him?
Now, tell the truth, aren't you a bit disappointed?... But I already told you...
Patrizia, don't start in again... I would rather be called depraved. Unless you happen to love children.
Here I am, Patrizia. I'm always here.
Agnes, it has come to my attention that you have stopped eating. Why is this? AGNES  I've been commanded by God.
Because I'm getting fat.
Because...
I do, I have to be attractive to God.
It's a sin to be fat.
How many times have I burned into your thick skull and the thick skull of your fellow novice, that menstruation is a perfectly natural process and nothing to be ashamed of.
A few years ago one of the Sisters came to me in tears, asking for comfort, comfort because she was too old to have any children. Not that she wanted to, but once a month she had been reminded of that possibility.
Should you see a doctor?
For what?
Well, who in particular?
Well do you love... do you love Father Martineau?
Do you think he loves you?
Often?
You want to talk about the baby don't you?
I never saw any baby... I think they made it up.
No. I was sick.
From God.
I don't understand what you're talking about... you want to talk about the baby... everybody wants to talk about the baby but... I never saw the baby so I can't talk about the baby because... I don't believe in the baby.
No... no, I don't want to answer any more questions.
Would you like some?
Why not?
Where do you think babies come from?
Like what?
It's like hiding from my mother when I was a little girl.
Oh, no place as wonderful as this. Agnes... have you ever thought of leaving the convent for something else?
How did she know that?
Did your mother see angels often?
Agnes, did you love your mother?
... that you don't remember getting pregnant...
What the child?
Agnes, I'm here because I want to help you.
But you're troubled... aren't you?
Agnes...
Yes?
Oh, yes.
Agnes, you're ugly!... what do you say? Of course you do. Agnes, you're ugly!... what do you say?
I really love you.
And why am I here?
Why?
To be a mother?
Why?
Who?
No.
For me to get sick in.
Is someone in the room with you?
It's bleeding... I'm bleeding... my God it won't stop, I can't get it to stop.  Let go of me, I wish you were dead.
Not your fault...
And then... what did she do?  Agnes what did she do?
Are you dictating my position to me? We're getting into some sticky legal territories here.
The longer you take to make a decision, the more difficult it will be for us.
The bishop is breathing down our necks.
Maybe there's something that's not in the report that should be.
Would you tell me why the hell this is taking so long.
Yes, that's because I'm getting to her.
I'll have a decision by next week.
Hello, Mama  ... brought you something.
No. We work the land alone. No-one but Sister Marguerite and I are permitted contact with the public.
Is that normal?
Who was the father?
Could there have been anyone else?
Yes, but that was some ten months ago. I fail to see that the identity of that somebody has anything to do with this trial.
This convent is locked solid. The only one that has a key is Sister Marguerite and she wouldn't let Christ in after dark.
Shortly after she came to us.
The Catholic Church...
I am not a virgin, Doctor. I was married for twenty three years, two daughters. I even have grandchildren... surprised? It might please you to know that I was a failure as a wife and mother. My children won't even see me any more, that's their revenge. I think they tell their friends that I've passed on. And don't tell me I'm making up for past mistakes Doctor Freud. 
Visitors to the convent.
Do you have a... a diary or a day book?
No, it just makes you doubly responsible doesn't it?
Like keeping her home from school?
There is more here than meets the eye isn't there?  Lots of dirty little secrets.
Why didn't you do anything to stop her?
Her spiritual health.
Because I am a moral person.
Who said anything about the Catholic Church...
Fine thanks...
Do you think Agnes is still attached to God?
The hypnotism. Do you still disapprove?
For Agnes.
But what you are choosing to believe is a lie because you won't face the fact that she was raped... or seduced... or that she did the seducing.
That's what I have to believe...
Somebody told her.
Too late for what?
The baby?
And the baby.
Before or after you killed the child?
I doubt that's what she'd say.
They're yours.
Oh you can have it, I'm packing it in -- it depresses me.
You heard, it gets on my wick.
I'm a deserter.
Yeah, I've blown school out.
No, Ginger, Eddy Fallon and Ding Dong.
Yeah.
Ginger's mad, he says things all the time and Eddy's good at punching and spitting.
Shurrup!
You don't think...
I mean lines, ducky, can you handle lines?
Only Susan Campey, our resident teenager. You'll have to love her. She's your symbol.
I beg your pardon?
Get him out of here!!
That's not your Grandfather.
Yes, he's filled his head with notions seemingly.
Oh, there you are!
Oh, Paul, you can't have your own way!!!
How'd you like a dirty great drum roll giving you a clout right in the middle of your solo?
Hello, he's not talking to me. He's having a sulk.
Are you pulling my leg?
But that's not like a real person at all.
They ought to be.
... all this and a jam butty too!!
Why? I mean, which are you, scared or selfish?
No, hang on, I've not gone daft. You see, when I was little me mother let me make some treacle toffee one time in our back scullery. When I'd done she said to me, "Go and give some to the other kids." So, I said I would but I thought to meself, "She must think I'm soft." Anyroad, I was eating away there but I wanted somebody else to know how good it was so in the end I wound up giving it all away ... but I didn't mind, mind, 'cos I'd made the stuff in the first place. Well ... that's why you need other people... an audience ... to taste your treacle toffee, like. Eh ... does that sound as thickheaded to you as it does to me?
That's it, parading the streets ... trailing your coat ... bowling along ... living!
You're living, are you? When was the last time you gave a girl a pink-edged daisy? When did you last embarrass a sheila wid your cool appraising stare?
Shush! Have they roughed you up yet?
Keep your voice down, this lot'll paste you, just for the exercise. Oh they're a desperate crew of drippings and they've fists like matured hams for pounding defenceless lads like you.
And if they get you on the floor watch out for your brisket.
I'm soldier of the Republic, you'll need the mahogany truncheon for this boyo. A nation once again.
That's right; convict without trial ... Habeas corpus.
Well, don't be daft, I've got to.
And another thing, where's that old mixer?
Eh ... pardon me for asking but who's that little old man?
Gie's a kiss!
Give 'em a pull.
We've got only half an hour till the final run-through. He can't walk out on us.
Look he's a mixer and a trouble maker!
No.
Paul, John, George - get at it.
Now get on with it.
The office was on the phone, they think it'd be better if we pushed straight to Wolverhampton.
No, you look here, John. I've only one thing to say to you.
Hello.
And my nose...
That's what you tell me.
It's all over the place, everyone knows.
It'll only get you into trouble.
Have <U>you</U> lost him?
None for me, then?
Stop picking on him.
Yeah, you want to watch it.
I'm sorry Norm, but I can't help being taller than you.
Yeah, down the ... er ...
Oh they've probably gone to the canteen, cup of tea, like.
Oh no... this is a battle of nerves between John and me.
How's that?
Course he can talk. He's a human being, like. Isn't he?
"The Management of Boyd's takes pleasure in requesting the company of Mr. Richard Starkey, that's you, in their recently refinished gaming rooms. Chemin de Fer. Baccarat, Roulette, and Champagne Buffet." Blimey!
Shove the gentleman jockey in the make-up room or something and keep your eye on him, will you?
If there is some kind of alien intelligence down on that planetoid, it'd be a serious mistake for us to blunder in unequipped.
Do you remember the pyramid?
I don't recognize that constellation.
Can you get it a little closer?
Dell, I want greater magnification. More surface detail.  I want to see what this place looks like.
Appears to be a door hanging open, the entrance is clogged with debris.
I was scanning the horizon to see what I could pick up.  Look there, on that screen.
What was that Dell, I lost you, do you read me?
I have recorded the transmission.
Computer, what language was that?
<u>He</u> died.
Okay.
Dead!
Martin, this is Jay.  The intakes are clogged with dust.  We overheated and burned out a whole cell.
And when will you be ready to do that?
Hey, guess what?
This dust is getting clogged in the intakes again!
It's clear.
Blood's thoroughly oxygenated.
We don't know what might happen if we tried to kill it.  At least right now it's keeping him alive.
It's over, Hunter.
Hey now, what is this?
I'll do it.  The rest of you continue.
Maybe we don't have to.  It's trapped in there.  We could just leave it in there all the way back to Irth.
You can't say that; I think it's a good plan.
Can you get them back?
It's some kind of organ -- it's inserted some kind of tube or something down his throat.
What common objects?
It's close, real close.
<u>What is it</u>?
It's stopped?
We're going home.  We're in hyperspace.
I thought I'd find you here.
They're getting pretty close now.
My God, it's stormy for a piece of rock that size!
It appears to be a heavy fluid of some sort... it blocks the X-rays...
Where are we?
Let's hear it.
Zero.  Dry as a bone.
But?
Hey, can you guys hear me?
Would somebody fill me in?
We made it!  Damn, we made it!
Yes!
Are you <u>crazy</u>?
This is all the same creature.  We're seeing the different stages in its life-cycle.
Which presumably means...
I saw it.  Faust got himself jammed in the air lock door.  His body held it open.
But the lifeboat can't accelerate to light speed.
No, it won't work and I just realized why.  There's only one hypersleep freezer on the lifeboat. Only one of us could survive.
So what do we do?  Do we ignore it and finish loading the explosives into the boat -- or do we flush it out now?
Yes, and maybe launch the boat and blow it too... if the others are injured.
Kill me...
That was Melkonis... it ate Hunter...
No good... it's eaten too much of me...
It's a rhino.
We've got no option.  We're gonna have to get it off.
Cassie, thank Christ!  We're under attack.
Give or take.
Drains right into the Central Reservoir.
I can't reach her.  Too much signal break-up.
I lose 'em all, that's why I'm still out here on this rock.  Anything else you wanna ruin my day with?
Where're they headed?
When?
Not yet.
Oh, man...
Ah, quit griping.  Keeps you in shape doesn't it?
Careful of that edging there...
Hold it, hold it...
Secondary fluidic shunt for the sewage system.  I found the grating ripped right off.  The little fucker was strong.
Shit!  Our armory's a big blue box from the back shelf of stores.  We got about two clips left for an autoloader, and that's it.
Is this the suit?
We had to.  They were just too cumbersome for some of the conduits you're gonna have to negotiate.  Besides, all the crap floating around reduces visibility to the extent where I doubt having helmet lights would have make that much difference, anyway.  Maintenance lights down there oughta be enough to do the trick.
That's what we thought.
Central Pumping.  All the waste gets  treated, broken-down, and flushed out into the swamp.  If it wanted a quick exit then it really lucked- out.
They knocked out the external feeds.
Sorry.  Two green enabling buttons...
Okay, we're in business.
Okay, I'm out of here!
I've got a lot of thinking to do.  'Sides, the room was getting too crowded for me.
First light, we'll take a chopper out there and tell them to head back.
I'm going to need you to co-sign the report.  Until we come up with something, this'll be treated as first degree murder.
That's the wrong way!
They...they snapped my legs to fit... fit me in here.  I don't...remember what happened next.
A revolutionary approach to the Theater. However, if I may a suggestion...
We all come into this world with our little egos equipped with individual horns. If we don't blow them - who will?
- perhaps more than one. There's so much I want to know. I've heard your story in bits and pieces... your home in Wisconsin, your tragic marriage, your financial attachment to Margo - it started in San Francisco, didn't it?  I say - your idolatry of Margo started in San Francisco, didn't it?
San Francisco. An oasis of civilization in the California desert. Tell me, do you share my high opinion of San Francisco?
Stop rehearsing your column... Isn't it strange, Addison? I thought I'd be panic-stricken, want to run away or something. Instead, I can't wait for tonight to come. To come and go...
Was the setting properly romantic - the lights on dimmers, gypsy violins off stage?
There never was, there'll never be another like you.
What do you take me for?
Champion to champion.
Addison, will you please say what you have to say plainly and distinctly - and then get out so I can take my nap!
I can't believe my ears...
Your name is not Eve Harrington. It is Gertrude Slescynski.
I had to get in, to meet Margo! I had to say something, be somebody, make her like me!
Because I don't want to.
Exactly.  Here. Take it to the party instead of me.
This answer satisfies me a hundred percent.
I was there. An eyewitness.
Margo? Lunching in public?
Eve, this is an old friend of Mr. deWitt's mother - Miss Caswell, Miss Harrington...  Addison, I've been wanting you to meet Eve for the longest time-
The ladies' - shall we say - lounge?
I refer to your new and unpregnant understudy. Eve Harrington.
Didn't you know?
Just slipped your mind.
When? When are you going to do it?
Nothing?
She's quite a girl, that what's-her name...
You're not such a bargain, you know, conceited and thoughtless and messy-
You're my girl, aren't you?
You in a hurry?
Kid stuff or not, it doesn't happen every day, I want to heat it - and if you won't say it, you can sing it...
She did...?
I'll check with Eve...
I love you too. Good night, darling-
Outside of a beehive, Margo, your behavior would hardly be considered either queenly or motherly!
Happy little housewife...
Don't let me kill the point. Or isn't it a story for grownups?
I can't believe you're making this up - it sounds like something out of an old Clyde Fitch play...
Now how can you take offense at a kid trying in every way to be as much like her ideal as possible!
Mad! Darling, there are certain characteristics for which you are famous - on stage and off. I love you for some of them - and in spite of others. I haven't let those become too important to me. They're part of your equipment for getting along in what is laughably called out environment - you've got to keep your teeth sharp. All right. But you will not sharpen them on me - or on Eve...
It's all over.
The ex-ship news' reporter. No body, no voice, all mind!
I will not calm down!
Well, you needn't. I will not be tolerated. And I will not be plotted against!
- shows up for an audition when everyone knew I'd be here... and gives a performance! Out of nowhere - gives a performance!
Paranoiac!
It's obvious you're not a woman.
Well, I am.
I wouldn't want you to marry me just to prove something.
"Please forgive me for butting into what seems such a happy occasion - but it's most important that I speak with you. Please" - it's underlined - "meet me in the Ladies' Room. Eve."
Groom-  - may I have a wedding present?
With the paper to prove it.
Just wondered what?
Thanks for your help... good luck.
I'll admit I was worried when Max called. I had my doubts.
You're always after truth - on the stage. What about off?
Find out.
Margo does not play a lunatic, Birdie.
Bill says actors out there eat just as infrequently as here-
How do you do, my dear.
And this is my good friend and companion, Miss Birdie Coonan.
She, too, is a great admirer of yours.
But the wardrobe women have got one. And next to a tenor, a wardrobe woman is the touchiest thing in show business-
Why not?
She's loyal and efficient-
That's all.
How'd you get all the way up here from Brooklyn?
Why should you be? After all, six nights a week - for weeks - of watching even Margo Channing enter and leave a theater-
Bill Sampson? He's - he's a director.
There should be a new word for happiness. Being here with Miss Channing has been - I just can't say, she's been so wonderful, done so much for me-
Karen...  ... isn't it awful, I'm about to ask you for another favor - after all you've already done.
Then - would you talk to Mr. Fabian about it?
The reason is Margo and don't try to figure it out. Einstein couldn't.
Eve. I'm fond of Margo too. But I know Margo. And every now and then there is nothing I want to do so much as to kick her right square in the pants.
Karen...  ... you won't forget, will you? What we talked about before?
Eve... don't cry.
But the raves about your performance-
Well. I think you're painting the picture a little darker than it is, really. If nothing else - and don't underestimate him - you have a powerful friend in Addison.
Eve. I - I don't think you meant to cause unhappiness. But you did. More to yourself, perhaps - as it turned out - than to anyone else...
She knows enough not to be here.
Congratulations, Eve.
How'd hear about it?
Well... it started with the play before this one...
It's been a real pleasure, Eve.
What - again?
I must say you can certainly tell Mr. Sampson's been gone a month.
Oh, come now, as though you were an old lady... I'm on my way. Is there anything more you've thought of-?
I've got it.
Terribly sorry I'm late, lunch was long and I couldn't find a cab - where's Miss Caswell, shall we start? Oh, hello, Eve...
Hi.  Hello, darling-
Ain't it the truth?
She's just outside the door.
Any houses or farms around where we can borrow gas?
So many people - know me. I wish I did. I wish someone would tell be about me...
Why should he - and why should you?
About Eve. I've acted pretty disgracefully toward her, too.
In this rat race, everybody's guilty till they're proved innocent! One of the differences between the Theater and civilization...  ... what gets me is how all of those papers in town happened to catch that particular performance!
But not right away? First the business of fighting them off, chin up, stout fella...
Margo - and Bill - want us to meet them at the Cub Room tonight, after theater. For a bottle of wine.
Darling, I didn't promise Eve anything. Just said I thought she'd be fine for the part, but there were some practical difficulties...
How about calling it a night?
Who's left out there?
You disapprove of me when I'm like this, don't you?
"Cora." She's - still a girl of twenty?
Don't be evasive.
... as young as they want, you mean. And I'm not interested in whether thousands of people think I'm six or six hundred-
You have a genius for making barroom brawl out of a perfectly innocent misunderstanding at most!
I placed...?
Let the rest of the world beat their brains out for a buck. It's friends that count. And I got friends.
You get quick action, don't you?
She'd be a great help - read scripts, interview people you have to see, get rid of the ones you don't have to... you'd be a man of leisure-
Think of your health, Max - more time to relax out in the fresh air at a race track...
This is for lawyers to talk about, this concerns a run-of-the-play contract, and this you can't rewrite or ad lib!
--Bradlee went to Harvard--
All right, what do we know?
--what do you think?--
--I'm trying--
---fifteen or more phone calls from the burglars in Miami to Gordon Liddy at CREEP--
And?--And?--
This is terrific work, if you like rejection.
We never reveal our sources, which is why you can talk to us.
I hate both parties.
Who'd you vote for?
Did he just say what I think he said?
--she was really paranoid, the bookkeeper.
How do you want to handle Sloan?
Think Sloan's back?  What's wrong?
Look--five men controlled that slush fund as CREEP--three of them we've got, Mitchell, Stans, Magruder, and we're pretty sure of Kalmbach.
Goddamnit--
--for the first time I'm beginning to feel like a fucking reporter-- Woodward, I got a tip. A guy called me up with a tip--  --someone named Donald Segretti contacted a bunch of lawyers and asked them if they'd like to go to work with him screwing up the Democrats, dirty tricks, shit like that. The FBI knows about Segretti-- Howard Hunt made a bunch of phone calls to him--they interrogated him, but on account of Segretti wasn't involved with the break-in, they didn't follow through. But Segretti did a lot of traveling--he called these lawyers from different places, and he told them the Republicans knew what he was doing.
Dwight Chapin, Nixon's appointments chief--he knew Segretti in school. Maybe I'm crazy, but this is the first time any of this starts to make sense. What were the three theories?
What would you have done?
Nah.  Maybe.
I wish we were investigating Attila the Hun.
How many fucking sources they think we got?--
What does it say?
--jeeeeeeesus--
--all that crap, you're putting it in the paper? It's all been denied. You tell your publisher--tell Katie Graham she's gonna get her tit caught in a big fat wringer if that's published. Good Christ! That's the most sickening thing I ever heard.
--what time is it?
You want Barker's phone stuff or his money stuff?
Sorry.  Now if it was Hunt you were interested in--
Could you reach Mr. Dardis by car radio?
I'm Carl Bernstein.  My paper sent me out to see if I couldn't persuade you to go on the record.
Listen--we know you're involved in this--we're going to get the story, why not help?
Do you feel much about the things you did?
I don't know anything about Haldeman, except, Dwight's frightened of him-- everybody's frightened of him--Christ, I wish I'd never gotten messed around with this--all I wanna do is sit in the sun; sit, swim, see some girls.
Can't help you.
I'm the one sent you to Toronto, Bernstein--
--he was going to go into law practice with Segretti.
--and we got a guy in Justice--
What's a real denial?
I thought you guys were supposed to be working on this story--  --you think I like being aced out?
Hey... very tense.
--you don't really think you're being followed?
Hey, easy...
You've really got to go.
We don't tell anyone that. Which is why you can talk to us. And if we can't verify what you say someplace else, we don't print it. That's another reason you can relax.
There are too many people watching me--they know I know a lot--
A lot of it was. I just thought it was sort of an all-purpose political fund--you know, for taking fat cats to dinner, things like that.
--then again, maybe things are even worse than we've written--
We were never told flat out "Don't talk." But the message was clear.
What happens when the baby comes?
--I don't know, I don't know, it feels thin--
--well shit, we oughtta be tense-- we're about to accuse Mr. Haldeman who only happens to be the second most important man in America of conducting a criminal conspiracy from inside the White House--  --it would be nice if we were right--
It will, it just hasn't bottomed out yet, give it time.
I was told by this guy at the White House that Hunt was investigating Teddy Kennedy.
--I saw him. He verifies.
We can't talk inside either?
Mr. Caddy? My name's Bob Woodward, I'm from the Post and I wanted to ask about how you happened to come on this case--
You claiming it was all a misunderstanding, Ken?
Then there must be something, mustn't there. Look, forget the myths the media's created about the White House-- the truth is, these are not very bright guys, and things got out of hand.
Follow the money. Always follow the money.
My turn to keep you waiting.  What's the topic for tonight?
Yes, the little ratfuckers are now running our government.
Why did they do all this for Chrissakes?--what were they after?
Talk about Segretti--
I was just kind of wondering why your name and phone number were in the address books of two of the men arrested at Watergate?
And what is your occupation, Mr. McCord?
I'm so glad you could come, Mr.--
You know, the paper was my father's and my husband's when they were alive and I was thinking back a year or two ago when Ben called me and said he wanted to publish the Pentagon Papers the next day. The Times had already been stopped from publishing anymore of them and all my legal counsel said "don't, don't" and I was frightened but I knew if I said no, I'd lose the whole fifth floor. So we published, and that night, after I'd told Ben to go ahead, I woke up in the darkness and I thought, "Oh my Lord, what am I doing to this newspaper?"  I woke up again last night with that same question.  Are we right on this story?
Never? Please don't tell me never.  Ben says you've found some wonderful sources.
--you are ignoring the importance of the Dahlberg repercussions--
What'd you get on W.House?
--in other words, you got nothing, you're thumbsucking.
That was awhile ago.
--listen, we didn't make them do these things--once they did, it's our job to report it--
Isn't that what you'd expect them to say?
What do you think Mrs. Graham wants to see me for?
--and he says Chapin hired Segretti--
And as treasurer, you could release those funds?
I can't say anything, I'm sorry. 
I'll do it.
Good morning gentleman.
You're just gonna sit there and drink your coffee?
...Nevermind.  You have anything to drink?
Of course, Finch.  What?
What are we gonna hear?
Yeah...so...you've got this sort of... Bobby McFerrin thing going there.
Nice car.
My dad's always here running the store, busy and stuff...and I fill in once a week so he can get a night off.
So you're going to Michigan?
You want onions?
Well, I mean, business is okay, and lacrosse is awesome, but what am I gonna be, a pro lacrosse player?  I really have no idea.
I know.  Salt and pepper?
I'm sorry, I totally spaced.  I just...I didn't realize it...
You're missing the game for us?!
This isn't the best way to proposition me.
Hmm.  You know that's  really a shitty middle name!
That's not why we're going out.
You got it, stud.
Are you kidding?  No.
Give it to me!  Yes!
You think she was serious?
What about you?  You're the one with the girlfriend and you're still stranded on third base.
That's stupid.
Holy shit.
How do you know that?
Yeeeeeeeaaaawwwwww!
No, no that's fine.  So you doing okay?
I know, Dad.
Dad!!
Hold on.  You have no idea why I'm angry?
Okay.  Michelle, do you want to be my date for the prom?
Oh, I've got stories, believe me. They're a little more risque than tales of Band Camp.
So, the end of the story is...you had to kiss the guy for twenty seconds?
Oh yeah!  Put it in your mouth!
I still think you're okay.
I'll just say that we had a great night together.
It's true.  I mean, after this, everything'll be different.
What's up, fellas?
Indeed.  Some fine ladies here, boys. Confidence is high, repeat, confidence is high. Sherman is moving to DefCon Two, full strategic arsenal ready for deployment.
Well.  You have seen me.  Now it is my turn to see you.  Strip.
No, not again.
SUCK ME, BEAUTIFUL!
Ho-lee shit.
I was being selfish.  And majorly insensitive.  And I'm a total idiot.
And I want to try to make it up to you.
Oh Kevin -- don't stop!
That's my trick!
I think you're so right, Kevin.
So, do you want to be -- I mean, how do you want to do it?
Victoria...I love you.
Try the spicy tuna hand roll.
Uh -- forget that.  Look, is that all you're interested in?  Ways to get your girlfriend into bed?
Hey.  I got another question for you.
The Sha-lin masters from east and west must unite!
So, I'm thinking prom is basically our last big chance.
What reputation?
I guess we'll call you two-ply.
Hah!  Yeah, Oz, I bet it's more like your dad works at <u>her</u> store.
I think you need your balls reattached.
Hey, you know, what can I say, I dig those cute little sweaters she wears.
Oh my fucking God.  You're gay.
Our last game is this Saturday.
Here, babe.
You know.  If we hook up, tomorrow I'll just be some girl you go telling all your friends about.
Actually, I'm waiting for someone.
God. How can you eat like that?
Hey, you can't kick me! You're an apparition!
Ha-ha!
Sure. I can follow that.
Salots! Shitfucker!
What happened? Did you cut yourself?
You have to be a hero. All Americans think they are cowboys.
Come on Serafine. Let's go out. Show me the real Paris, the part that isn't overpriced and overrun with German tourists.
What about food? Even beautiful women have to eat. It's true. I read it. Please? A half an hour?  My treat?  Pleez! Don't make go out there alone again! I'm begging you!
Don't you want to change?
Shit! You bought enough pate for a fucking army!
Like I should talk. Monsieur foot-in- the-mouth. I'm really sorry about that whole Woody Allen thing...
I hope they fucking fry us all.
Okay. Be careful.
There's something down there! A bear or something! A god damn monster! Beau coup teeth! Huge, Grande, with yellow eyes, all this hair, it killed Serafine! My God...
It's you. You should be dead in that wreck with Bazin and Racine!
No. But I'll kill your fucking girlfriend!
Don't be an idiot! I'm not the only one. If I die, Serafine dies!
Nothing's happening!
We know you were with her.
He was a good man. Now his wife is a widow.
It's horrible. Terrence was one of the most brilliant men I've known.
It killed him... You coulda just used Draino. It's cheaper.
Uncle Terrence?
Where is it! Please!
What the hell, lots of my heroes killed themselves. Hemingway, Van Gogh... um... Herve Villachaise...
Yeah, well I don't know much about chemistry, but even if this stuff works, you better find it by midnight. Otherwise it's -
Okay. So he's weird. Maybe on drugs. Still, that's not -
Enough. Cut him loose.
Here.
Two more nights in this lunar cycle.
Why were you so late tonight
What were you showing her?
Are you running away?
Anya! What if <u>we</u> can't find anyone who loves us?!
Noooo....
Is everyone all right?
We have to prepare you for an audience with Sophie.
Poor Meetoo!
Ouch!  That really hurt!
People say Anastasia was the only member of the Royal Family to escape alive.  That makes her an orphan too 
I don't know - I don't remember anything that happened before the revolution. . .
Every Russian family has one..
...fish fork, salad fork, meat fork and. . .  [THIS SECTION ALSO NOT LEDGABLE]
I'm so scared...
Who are you, child?
PAR AWAY, LONG AGO GLOWING DEEP AS AN EMBER
I wanted to come home, Grandmama - and I did. I came back to my home with you.
What?
Trust me, it's her!
Boy, don't you hate it when that happens?
It's her.
You're a princess...
What do we do now?
Life is funny, isn't it. You find the right girl ... and then you lose her.
But this invitation came from the Empress herself! It's the social event of the decade! You can't turn it down!
You are the boy ...
Are you impressed with our Anastasia?
Hey, you on television?
Singer!
Not only is he a great agent, but he really gives good meetings.
You're like New York. You're an island.
No, it can't be, because he's a comic.
Okay. All right, so whatta yuh saying, now? That e-e-everybody o-o-on the Warren Commission is in on this conspiracy, right?
I-I-I-I would leave out the men's- room attendant.
Oh!
I know, well, it's just that- you know, I mean, I-I-I-I gotta sing tomorrow night, so I have to rest my voice.
I know. Well, Alvy, it'll pass, it'll pass, it's just that I'm going through a phase, that's all.
So, so-well, here's what I wanna know. W-what...  Am I your first big romance?
Hi. Hi, hi.
Sure. W-w-w-which way yuh goin'?
So, how long do you know Janet? Where do you know her from?
Yeah... so, listen-you drive?
You're the worst driver I've ever seen in my life... that's including any place... the worst... Europe, United... any place... Asia.
Who? Grammy? Grammy Hall?
Your grammy!
I'll see yuh.
No, I got time.
Oh, you see an analyst?
Well, who's Sadie?
Yeah, it's a great story, though, I mean, I... I... it really made my day. Hey, I think I should get outta here, you know, 'cause I think I'm imposing, you know...
Why not?
Yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah, I see. I guess-
Well, I don't know. I mean, I guess- I guess you must be sorta late, huh?
Oh, no-I mean, I'm just a-auditioning sort of at club. I don't-
Yeah.
Hey, listen, listen.
Yeah, why not, because we're just gonna go home later, right?
I'm gonna have a corned beef.
There's-there's-there's-there's Mr. When-in-the-Pink, Mr. Miami Beach, there, you know?  He's the latest! just came back from the gin-rummy farm last night. He placed third.
Look at these guys.
Oh, that's hilarious. They're back from Fire Island. They're... they're sort of giving it a chance-you know what I mean?
No, I'm serious.  I just got my mustache wet.
You see, like you and I...
You- Do you love me?
Yeah, bu-bu-but why?
No, don't be silly. What-what do we need other people for?  You know, we should-we should just turn out the lights, you know, and play hide and seek or something.
Yeah, grass, right? The illusion that it will make a white woman more like Billie Holiday.
Me, no. You... I-I-you know, if I have grass or alcohol or anything I get unbearably wonderful. I get too, too wonderful for words. You know, I don't-I don't know why you have to, uh, get high every time we make love.
Oh, you have my body.
Well, I need grass and so do you.
Alvy, you were... Alvy, you were just great, I'm not kidding. It was- You were so neat.
Yeah. Yeah. And you know something? I think that I'm starting to get more of your references, too.
Yeah.
You followed me. I can't believe it!
Do you realize how paranoid you are?
Hey, don't knock masturbation! It's sex with someone I love.
"Neat"! There's that- What are you- twelve years old? That's one o' your Chippewa Falls expressions! "He thinks I'm neat."
You've always had hostility toward David ever since I mentioned him!
And then she mentioned penis envy... Did you know about that?
Well, she said that I was very guilty about my impulses toward marriage, and-and children.
And then I remembered when I was a kid how I accidentally saw my parents making love.
Yeah.
Oh, and God, Alvy, I did... this really terrible thing to him. Because then when he sang it was in this real high-pitched voice.
She said, "Will it change my wife." You heard that because you were there so I'm not crazy.
David! David! I can't believe this!
I'm following you and David, if you-
What's- It's me, open up.
That's what you got me here for at three o'clock in the morning, 'cause there's a spider in the bathroom?
Hey, what am I-your son? Whatta you mean? I-I came over to --
Hey, what is this? You got black soap?
You know I think that if you let me, maybe I could help you have more fun, you know? I mean, I know it's hard and... Yeah.
Oh, look, look, there's that... that's that's my old house. That's where we used to live.
Well, I had a really good day, you know that? It was just a real fine way to spend my birthday.
I mean... I tried everything, you know, I-I-I put on soft music and my- my red light bulb, and...
The incredible thing about it is, I'm paying for her analysis and she's making progress and I'm getting screwed.
You know... it's getting expensive my analyst... for her analyst. She- she's making progress and I'm not making any progress. Her progress is defeating my progress.
That's sick!
God, it's so clean out here.
Oh, good. Okay.
Don't you think his girl friend's beautiful?
Alvy, uh, let's face it. You know something, don't think our relationship is working.
Oh, it sure has... You know, you wrote your name in all my books, 'cause you knew this day was gonna come.
God.
Why? You wanna live out here all year? It's like living in Munchkin Land.
No.  Yes, of course I'm mad, because you love me, I know that.
Oh!
Oh, really, I heard that Commentary and Dissent had merged and formed Dysentery.
Me? No, no. I-I couldn't make it that ni- My-my raccoon had hepatitis.
I can think of another word.
Are you?
I can't get with any religion that advertises in Popular Mechanics. Look-  there's God coming outta the men's room.
Thank you very much. It's a pleasure.
This is a great house, really. Everything. Saunas, Jacuzzis, three tennis courts. You know who the original owners were? Nelson Eddy, then Legs Diamond. Then you know who lived here?
What are you making such a big deal about?  They're only lobsters. Look, you're a grown man, you know how to pick up a lobster.
Sixteen years ago.
Just give me the license, please.
Forget it, Max.
Max, my serve is gonna send yuh to the showers-
Max, the city is terribly worried.
Do you realize how immoral this all is?
I think he has a little thing for Annie.
The one with the V.P.L.
If she comes over here, Max, my brain is going to turn into guacamole.
Uri Geller must be on the premises someplace.
Oh, I can imagine. P-p-probably the wife of an astronaut.
Heavy! Eaten by some squirrels.
We went over to the swap meet. Annie, Gram and I. Got some nice picture frames.
Just... that's all you need. You can come and stay here.
There's a whole wing in this house.
Tessie, they say you were the sister with personality.
It's going.  It's going.
Isn't Skye amazing?
I don't know how to make her funny.
Oh.  Do you have any pictures?
Jesus, Sally.  I'm not the enemy.
It's not a contest.
I'm the hired help.
That for us?
Directing suits you.
Just did.  Jealous?
So?
The suspense is killing me.
Oh.  You're them.
We've heard lots about you.
Are you my big brave boy?  Are you my brave hero?
Damn near.  And a damn near perfect drug.
Just every once in a blue moon, you know.
Go.
He's okay, Clair.  You wanna give him a little room?
I'm fine, babe.  I'm gonna take a little walk.  I need a minute.  Let's forget it. My life didn't pass in front of my eyes. So, it probably wasn't that close.
Joe officially owns No. 4, Cheyenne Walk, Chelsea, London, England.  No small doing.
What you earn has to double in order to cover expenses in London, it's an outrageously expensive city.
He gets huge advances on his novels. He's going back to that.  You know how he hates it here.
You're out of your mind.
Take your time, Jer.
No luck.
What did you get me?
I mean, you're really back.
What?
Promise you'll be nice to the neighbors.
It's an unfair advantage.
Truce.
Dolphins.  Great.
Someone left the goddamn gate open.  Otis got out.  Skye and I, well the... I came out of the house and the fucking gate was wide open.
She left the fucking gate open.
Can't have gone far?  He's like a greyhound.  He could be miles away.
Fuck you.
Otis!  Come!  Good boy!  Come!
And how hard it hit?
You've been through it.  That's how you love people.  When it's easy for you, when it's convenient for you.
It is true.  You know how you love, Joe? You dedicate a book to someone.
What are you saying?
Who?  Who?  Who thinks that?
Don't.
I found out I was pregnant and it scared the shit out of me.
Life gets messy.  Ugly messy.  But I don't understand you.  And I don't think I ever understood Lucy.  I don't understand throwing it away.  How do you throw all that away?  Any of it.  I want it all.  You guys want guarantees?  I want the possibilities.  And all kinds of crap comes with that.  A lot of bad shit. And I think that's okay with me because, because of the rest of the stuff.  All the good shit.  All the surprises.  It's a fucking miracle when you come down to it.  We'd have had amazing children, you and me.  We'd have had a ride.  You'd have surprised yourself.  I'll never love anybody else, you know.
What's a sign for that?
I love gifts.  What did you guys get us?
The novel.  No, Skye Davidson is playing the lead.
Yes, she is.
It's a novel.
The infamous dog?
Mmm.  It says something about the two of you maybe.
A little out of my element.
Well, yes.  Yes, in fact.  A little on the outside, yes.  And there's been all this friction.
I don't know why, but these misunderstandings have a way of escalating.
Easy tiger.
What am I, five?
Nine...nine, yes?  Nine years, just about.
How do you do, Skye?
Yeah, well, it's just us and a few hundred of our closest friends.
What?
I was faking it.  I've been feeling caged for sometime.  Funny, huh?
I don't need a drug.
Jesus Christ, it's a fucking dog!
Is there space here?
The Shostakovich.
Otis you crazy dog!  Otis are you in this God forsaken Canyon?  My people are very hungry.
Will champagne help?
She's even better looking in the flesh.
Exactly what I mean.  It's all ruined.
Like the last time.
Okay.
Thank you.  This was so unnecessary.  I hope you've noticed that Otis isn't barking as much.  We keep him in at night.
I didn't know you had this.
Happy anniversary.  Thank you for making me a part of it.
You don't need to do that.
Nevermind.
But she really gets to the heart of Joe, doesn't she?  She's a genius.
No, no, not at all... I mean I've still got plenty of time.  Don't I?  I mean I still have a good six years, whatever. We could have three kids yet, if we wanted.  And I know I've always said I never wanted kids, and I didn't... but this year, I really, truly, feel ready...
Oh Soph, Joe loves kids.  Joe wants kids. Joe thinks he needs kids.
Don't try and change the subject.  Oh God, it feels great!  He's just a little narcissistic, irresponsible and unreliable.
You don't have kids to keep a marriage together, Sally.  It's only five months since Joe came back.
Sorry Azteca.  Here you go, fellas! Fresh dirt!  Alley oop!  Shouldn't we be wearing gloves?  I mean this dirt is very...dirty. Doesn't anyone think of hygiene?  Boy am I hungry.  I'm so hungry I'm seeing double.  It looks like there's <u>two</u> million ants in here.  When's lunch?  Tomorrow, or the day after?
The squeaky wheel gets the oil.
Break's over.
Are you asking me out to dinner?
General -- we have to talk sometime!
Uh oh.  Goodbye!  Gotta run!
Gee, uh, could you say it a little louder, I think there are some ants in the next colony who didn't hear you.
-- At the <u>worker bar</u>!  You were pretty hot to trot then!
I order you to find out where we are!
I've been kidnapped by the village idiot.
Water...water...
This lake is huge!  And so close to the colony!  Think of the vacation potential!
Out here I'm just what?
Look.  How many other Princesses are there?
So...you never did tell me...what made you come out to the worker bar that night?
Sorry, it's been through a war, not to mention everything else...
Why do they have you tied up here?
We shouldn't be doing this -- it isn't proper!
Of course not --
You new, kid?
You just stick by old Barbatus. He'll watch out for you.  Whatsamatter, kid?  Leave a girl behind?
Well, what exactly does our platoon do?  Serve beverages?  Process paperwork?
So we're going back for more armor, right?  I mean, these guys are from outer space, how are we supposed to beat them?!
Dammit, this tunnel is priority A-1! We can't afford <u>any delays</u> on this project!
Notice the big one, holding hands with the female?
We know what makes an ant colony strong, don't we?  We know that no ant can be an individual.  No <u>single</u> ant matters, right?
Not that one.  Or that one.
Geez, and I forgot my toothbrush.
Affirmative.
May I cut in?
All these parties are so marvellously <u>alike</u>.
You see?  Being an ant is being able to say, "Hey -- <u>I'm</u> meaningless, <u>you're</u> meaningless."
Of course.  You were born two seconds after me.
Time to cut a rug, Z!
You bet!  They'll really go for a sensitive guy like you!
Wear this.
Yeah, I know.
This the place?
So this is your mother's apartment?
Ma'am?
You wouldn't have such a thing as a napkin, would you?
What gives, Baxter? You getting promoted or getting fired?
I've been here twice as long as you have --
What did you do to your hair?
That makes me feel just terrible.
Twenty-seven.
Couldn't happen to a nicer guy.  You know, you're the only one around here who ever takes his hat off in the elevator.
The characters you meet. Something happens to men in elevators. Must be the change of altitude -- the blood rushes to their head, or something -- boy, I could tell you stories --
Good night.
Oh -- Miss Kubelik.  I've been waiting for you. FRAN You have?
Eight-thirty.
Well, don't tell the fellows in the office about the appendix. They may get the wrong idea how you found out.  'Bye.
Marry Christmas.
What gave you that idea?
I forgive you.
Three.
Really? You mean you wouldn't be ashamed to be seen with somebody in a hat like this?
Maybe if I wore it a little more to the side --  is that better?
I understand. Christmas -- family and all that --
You're in no condition to go anywhere -- except back to bed.
Miss Kubelik, I'm stronger than you are --
Wait a minute -- let's talk this over first.  Just what are you going to tell her?
Who?
His apartment?
I didn't mean it that way -- I was just talking to him on the phone -- he's very concerned about you.
You want me to move the television set in here?  You play gin rummy?
Why do people have to love people, anyway?
I just have this talent for falling in love with the wrong guy in the wrong place at the wrong time. BUD  How many guys were there?
I'm sure that's the explanation.
I don't like myself very much anyway.
It's only one story down -- the best you can do is break a leg.
Please, Miss Kubelik, you got to promise me you won't do anything foolish.
I would.
There's a call for you --
In this house, you're supposed to.
You mean to someone like Mr. Sheldrake.
Some people take, some people get took -- and they know they're getting took -- and there's nothing they can do about it.
I know how you feel, Miss Kubelik. You think it's the end of the world -- but it's not, really. I went through exactly the same thing myself.
Anyway, I parked the car and loaded the gun -- well, you read in the papers all the time that people shoot themselves, but believe me, it's not that easy -- I mean, how do you do it? -- here, or here, or here --  -- you know where I finally shot myself?
Uh-huh. While I was sitting there, trying to make my mind up, a cop stuck his head in the car, because I was illegally parked -- so I started to hide the gun under the seat and it went off -- pow!
Yeah. Took me a year before I could bend my knee -- but I got over the girl in three weeks. She still lives in Cincinnati, has four kids, gained twenty pounds -- she sends me a fruit cake every Christmas.
Are we dressing for dinner?
Say, you're pretty good with that racquet.
You don't have to if you don't want to --
Where are you going? BUD Who knows? Another neighborhood -- another town -- another job -- I'm on my own.
Some weather we're having.  Must be from all the meshugass at Cape Canaveral.  You locked out of your apartment?
Last night?
Baxter?
And Mr. Kirkeby tells me that several nights a week you work late at the office -- without overtime.
Mr. Vanderhof, in Public Relations, and Mr. Eichelberger, in Mortgage and Loan -- they'd both like to have you transferred to their departments.
Sir?
Baxter, an insurance company is founded on public trust. Any employee who conducts himself in a manner unbecoming --  How many charter members are there in this little club of yours?
That's not the point. Four rotten apples in a barrel -- no matter how large the barrel -- you realize that if this ever leaked out --
Where is your apartment?
I'm not just giving those tickets, Baxter -- I want to swap them.
Now remember, Baxter -- this is going to be our little secret.
Morning, gentlemen.  Everything satisfactory? You like your office?
I like the way you handled that. Well, how does it feel to be an executive?
You know how it is -- sooner or later they all give you a bad time.
Yes, she's in the shower -- she's coming along fine, considering.
Especially not Miss Kubelik.
What's gotten into you, Baxter?
Now, wait a minute. I know what you're thinking -- but it's not as bad as it looks -- MATUSCHKA  It's none of my business what you do, Fran -- you're over twenty- one -- but your sister happens to think you're a lady.
Hello? Yeah, Baxter. What's up?
Baxter, we're a little disappointed in you -- gratitude-wise.
So long, Baxter. We know you won't let us down.
Buddy-boy, why didn't you say so?  You got yourself a little playmate, huh?
Make it thirty minutes.  What do you say, Bud?
Let me worry about that.  Just leave the key under the mat and clear out.
Teamwork -- that's what counts in an organization like this. All for one and one for all -- know what I mean?
You threatening me?
Dear Mr. MacIntosh --  Vanderhof, Public Relations. Oh, yes, Baxter. Just a minute.  All right, Miss Finch -- type up what we got so far.  Now what is it, Baxter?
Quite an office -- name on the door -- rug on the floor -- the whole schmear.
Good evening, Baxter.
As a matter of fact, you must be an iron man all around. From what I hear through the walls, you got something going for you every night.
Hello, Miss Kubelik.
She'll sleep on and off for the next twenty-four hours. Of course, she'll have a dandy hangover when she wakes up --
Help yourself.
You got a girl-friend?
What's the matter? Did I do something wrong?
Say, what's going on here, anyway?
-- so yesterday afternoon I take Sylvia up to the apartment, and guess who he's got stashed away in the bedroom?
I see.  What do you think, Al? Can we help the man?
Hi, Buddy-boy. What happened to you?
Sleeping pills.
Please -- just let me sleep.
Hi. How's the branch manager from Kansas City?
Yes, I know.
How long has it been -- a month?
It's been hell.
You don't know what it's like -- standing next to you in that elevator, day after day -- Good morning, Miss Kubelik -- Good night, Mr. Sheldrake -- I'm still crazy about you, Fran.
You're not giving me a chance, Fran. I asked you to meet me because -- I have something to tell you. FRAN Go ahead -- tell me.
That's enough, Fran.
I saw my lawyer this morning -- I wanted his advice  -- about the best way to handle it --
Oh. Our friend from the Chinese restaurant. Thanks, Fran. We better keep it here.
Don't forget to kill the lights. See you Monday.
I rented a car -- it's going to be here at one o'clock -- we're driving to Atlantic City.
I know it's a drag -- but you can't find a hotel room in town -- not on New Year's Eve.
Some setup you got here.  A real, honest-to-goodness love nest.
Me? SHELDRAKE Thank you for giving that little pep talk to Miss Kubelik at the office party.
Propagate -- you know, multiply -- baby flies?
Take your pick -- they all like you -- I can tell --
What !
I don't know what you're talking about -- Get fucked --
Who the hell are you?
Moonby what?
Delta ?
I was an FO for the 25th.
Sometimes.
Headquarters 11 Corps -- 405th A.S.A Battalion -- S-2 -- Com-Sec -- Intelligence -- Nha Trang.
Yeah -- typical A.R.V.N.
How?
I know it sounds stupid, but I feel like the goddamn jungle's watching us.
Charlie?
He killed that guy without feeling anything.
Smoke !
We could go in tomorrow at dawn -- there's always off-shore wind in the morning.
Yeah, Chef -- go ahead -- take Lance with you --
Rocks, sand -- those two men who deserted.
Listen.
Will they attack?
Two hours after the fog lifted, we moved slowly to a spot we thought was roughly a mile and a half below Kurtz's camp. We approached a long sand-bank stretching down the middle of the river.
Jesus -- that guy's too damn much.
What do you want ?
Our Recon flight ?
You want me to clean it up -- simple and quiet.
Do me a favor buddy, please.
Yeah.
Fifty calibers, eh, Captain --
Attacks repulsed, as I was saying.  This is only  for this war, Captain. Viet Cong -- 54; North Vietnamese regular forces -- 15; South Vietnamese -- 28 -- regular forces and otherwise.  Americain -- 6. Of course, they were, perhaps, mistakes, Captain.
Captain?
We will never 'evacuate', Captain -- this is our home. Indochina is ours; it has been so for a hundred and twenty-one years, there is something to say for that.
Lance Johnson? The surfer?
Why the hell you wanna go up to Nu Mung Ba for?
Seems to me he got himself fragged. i heard some grunt rolled a grenade in his tent. Maybe a rumor. Helluva man -- remarkable officer. Walter Kurtz woulda been a General some day. General of the Army. Shit, Head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Did you knew Kurtz?
You talk like him. I don't mind taking casualties, Captain, but I like to keep my ratio ten to one in this unit -- ten Cong to one.
Yeah, I can see that. He's fuckin nuts --
No -- I don't want to sleep. I want to think. Water. Give me water.
Still playing by the rules.  You're a damn good kiler.
You could never figure it because it doesn't make sense.
Go away -- hide yourself.
Yes...
Did you know him very well?
I'll never get over it -- But I'll always remember him...
Maybe he'll get tubed.
No -- no, Captain.
I don't think he'd of shot us on the beach but -- he'd of shot us if he saw me taking the board --
Captain -- that was all true about the rats and chocolate and stuff?
And you could just tell when the supplies were booby trapped?
You think?
The other one --
I'd just clear out as soon as I could if I were you, sir. They're gonna start working on the bridge with torches again. Charlie will start throwing it in hard --
This boat's a mess.
Oh, you don't talk to Colonel Kurtz.  You listen to him. God, these are good. I kept these people off you, you know. It wasn't easy.
Who are you?
Cognac?
Do you miss your home, Captain? Have you someone there?
What's a big question?
What if I say no.
That's 27, sir.
102  CONTINUED:
First you save my ass, now you want to kill me.  Make up your goddamn mind.
165  CONTINUED:  
27   CONTINUED:
A certain sonofabitch bastard -more-
39   CONTINUED:
How long have you been up north?
You should know something.
Have you talked to Eric?
What happened here?
Going after killers isn't the same as chasing poachers, Eric.
Leave it here.
Had no choice...  ...Given the situation.
Desmond.
Nice bluff the other day with the tranquilizer gun out your jeep window.  See you again, maybe.
Surviving is what I know --
How the hell were they smart enough to find us?
Be my guest.
There's a snowmobile. Inside a day we could be on the Yukon.  I got money there.  Remember that five thousand?  Make it ten.  Be smart.  Take it and walk away.
Nome?  I figure you'd be a whaler, coming from there.
Don't judge me.  You're a joke, coming here from a fucked-up culture, telling us what to do!
They think you're in Fairbanks. If not, they still won't find you before the plane comes tomorrow.
Answer and I'll shoot!
Look down there, tell me what any of this matters.  Struggles of men get swallowed by the bigness. Soon there won't be a trace of our troubles... or us.
Hullo, Sam.  Slow day?
Can we buy the Marshal some dinner?
You wouldn't shoot anyone...
All this for laying traps on private land?
Sam, listen -- I shot to defend my man.  Other guy drew first.
I'll get loose before that plane comes.
I'm not too old to knock the snot out of you!
-- Here's a hundred dollars.  And if you or anyone else will back me up on this --
You don't mind me saying, Mr. Desmond, you look like hell.
Not a damn thing.  What's going on?  Mr. Meyerling was here, all steamed up, looking for you.
I was just on my way to your ladyfriend's, but I guess she found you.
You don't care enough about Sam to --
I'm too old for this shit.
...You give us a ride in the Cessna you got hangared at the pumping station, we'll be in Fairbanks in a few hours.
Wilder's missing church services; you believe it?
He saw you and Corbett come in...
LeMalle.  We got a problem. Where's Mitchell?
You hear me?  Ben?
Next plane's not coming 'til next Monday.
Spencer is okay. You'd better start finding something else to do with your free time. If you can't feel good about this break and step out a little...  You ought to get Mr. Udall to send you over a psychiatrist.
I don't know... It's very strange not feeling that stupid panic thing inside you all the time. Without that you just start thinking about yourself -- and what does that ever get anybody. Today, on the bus there was this adorable couple and I felt myself giving them a dirty look -- I had no idea everything was...
How was it talking to him?
Stop it!! Why can't I have a normal boyfriend??? Why? Get out of here. Just a regular boyfriend who doesn't go nuts on me...
He's good...  And I'm an expert on doctors.
Not your name...  what are you telling me your name for!! Where is he?
It's amazing these things weren't done.
Me. My home number is on this card.
I know. He's just the best.
What's with the plastic picnic ware? Why not try ours...  afraid it isn't clean?
Last week I was playing the piano for him and he likes it, and so I decide I'm going to make a little joke...
This is not a sexist thing. If you were a waiter I would still be here saying...
Yeah, yeah...  any chance you'll get back to work today?
No... no thank you notes.
Nice of you... thank you.
The stiff one eye?
There's... there's no need to bring anything dressy... or... I mean -- I didn't know if we'd be eating at any restaurant that have dress codes.
No. Wait. What? Why? I didn't mean it. You gotta sit down. You can still give me the dirty look... just sit down and give it to me.
And mean it...
I am so afraid you're about to say something awful...
That's maybe the best compliment of my life.
I don't want to hear that music right now.
Here are the keys to my apartment. I'm going to park you in my place while I take Carol home.
Cute.
Okay to say something now?
What job?
I wasn't asleep!!
No! It's certainly not. No -- I don't think so. No.
I haven't even been thinking about sketching for weeks.
But you're beautiful... your skin glows.
I'm filling in. We don't know if she's coming back. She might have to get a job closer to home.
Hey, hey...  Haaa...  bad but temporary. The nurses say it's much better than you looked three weeks ago...  the hand will come back...  they're sure...
So, what's new anyway? How's Verdell?
You are very certain my dog is okay...  because you have no idea...
I'm sorry that I'm not taking you.
Simon, you've got to get dressed.
No touch. No touch. No touch.
Police! Police! Fucking crooked police...  doughnut-munching morons help me!  Assault and battery and you're black.
Hey -- you called me... I...
It's not only financial assistance. What he's got to do is go to Baltimore tomorrow and ask his parents for money. It's not going to happen on the phone.
Take my car -- a convertible. Do you drive?
Frank loves you. You know that... but I've spoken to him and he feels that --  -- as a businessman, with limited resources...
Oh, is he dead?
My dog... you know... I mean my little dog with the adorable face... Don't you know what my dog looks like?
Which color was that?
If you'll excuse me I'm not feeling so well.
Now we'll both call him.
I have never been so tired in my life. Okay, if I sit here?
That's very thoughtful.
You going to come talk to me or not?
What did she say?
Nothing. I just watch till something strikes me. Do anything you think of -- try different thing. Until I say, "hold that pose." Then just try and comfortably hold it.
Wait -- I want to see the painting.
Uh, Fontella's
Why?  What happened?
Hey.  What I don't get was why didn't you take the shot inside the restaurant?  I mean you had me, a free shot.  That's what I would have done.
You don't have to tell me that. It's just, I know my bid was low, but was it too low?  I mean, did I seem like an amateur, like I didn't know what I was doing?
Oh!  I got a question.  Jesus, this has been driving me crazy for years -- shit, listen to me.  I sound like some fucking fanboy.  I'm sorry, but I just got to ask you.  Everybody talks about how you left the Agency and got into the business and then how you went after the Russian, Nicholai Talinkov --
Did you see how I did that?  Magic wasn't it?
You don't know a fucking thing about me.  You don't have the slightest fucking clue.
Who is the mark?
Is this how it went, Nick?
Nikita?  She helped me find you.
I work for the government.
Twenty large?  That's all?
Don't tell me I don't have a choice!
Why?
You don't know that -- you're trying to scare me.
Yeah.
Because that's how it works.  That's what it's about.  He was the best. He was on top.
Yes.  As soon as you get into this business, all you can think about is getting to the top.  That's all there is.  Until then, there is nothing.  You are nothing.
Because you are a women.
The only thing different about the private sector is that a General Contractor takes less of a percentage than the government, so you make more money.  Then once you make the transition, you realize you were never working for the government; it was always the private sector, the vested interests and it's the same vested interests that continue to buy your plane tickets.
This is fiction!  Don't you see that?  This is another reality.  And the people that come into the world to play this game -- nobody forces them!  They're here, they know the rules, the stakes, the risks!  Do you understand what I am saying?  No one is innocent -- including you!
Good.
About?
It helps me to focus.  It centers me, helps me think.
But you've never figured out a way to win.
What will you do if this works, if we get the money?
Do you think he's here?
What do you think he's doing?
Where did you learn it?
This is the bank.  This is the hotel.  In the morning I will enter the bank.
The sun will be low, almost dark, the air cool and the bank will almost be closed.  5:45.  5:50.  He will put the rifle down, he will get up and he will walk across the plaza to the bank.
He won't be able to.  He'll have to go inside.  He'll have to see with his own eyes, whether or not I am there.  If the bank closes, he won't know for sure.  He'll come.  I'm sure.  And when he does you'll go into the hotel, go upstairs and take the gun.
I've been thinking about it for a long time.
What?
I told you, he will.
Ten years ago.
You didn't take it.
Why did you trade a bishop for a knight?
It was no big deal.  I saw them leave, I went in.
Nobody ever sees me.
I know.  It makes me crazy.
Because, I'll take it.
Yes.
Yes.
Is this becoming complicated?
He's coming, Electra!  Get out now!
I thought it was interesting --
Right.  In my hands I have five back-up disks he made of all of his work last night.
I prefer it like this.
Why are you working today?
You're very good at this aren't you?
How much farther?
Funny, I've never been a talker. My wife was always getting on me about that.  'Say what you feel, tell me what's bothering you, you ve got to talk to me.'  I never would though.  Not really.
You're pretty famous aren't you?
I know this may seem like a strange question, but can I ask you how much the contract was for -- not to insult you or anything, I know you're a professional, but just for me, I was just wondering.
I have been thinking about this for a long while.  I knew this day was coming.  I knew someday someone would make the call on me. I never thought about anyone that I had whacked.  What do you call it anyway?
Can I ask you something?
Can I ask you a question?
Why didn't you fade?
Cheers Katka!
Sounds cool.....Do you think he's serious about squatting a place?
Because it's in English?
Sorry Katka, but I'm with Doug on this.
It all comes down to ideology and they've lost theirs. If I'd been here ten years ago, maybe they wouldn't be in the mess they are today.
Just because they've got a choice of four McDonalds, doesn't mean they can afford a cheeseburger.
What we need is a space for real performance art. A cultural exchange for radical expressionism.
You were right Jahn, it's a great space..... Hey, Chris. Do you want to come and look?
No, I got nothing till Tuesday.
No, but like my dad said, "There's only so many ways you can wire a plug".
Somehow, I'm going to have to band-aid that thing since we can't really replace it and then put a walkway over it.
I'll drill the locks and replace the barrels, that way it won't cost so much.
Wow!....What have you been doing, rolling around in it?
I'm an idiot?
I don't know but that used to be a window and I think that was a door.
Yeah, her name's Kavlova, why?
I thought you were gonna throw these?
Red or white?
Have you cleared all the rubble up?
No, We aren't going to do it.
You Romeo's sure pay a high price sometimes - anyone I know?
A fine specimen for conversion.
Yeah, Dave Walters.
It's...42 56 76 .
God, I think I need a holiday.
You mean, Josh's father had nothing to do with it?
Sure, it's on the red metro line you....
Now - Your name is Douglas Greenwell, yes?
Date of birth, November the fourth nineteen-sixty-two.
Your home address is 18 Thornton Avenue, Coventry.
Well, I'll try and get that clarified. As I understand it though, the charges include break and enter, theft, trespass, operating an unlicensed facility, vandalism and destruction of government documents - Whatever possessed you to start destroying people's medical records?
No! Look Lawrence, I've taken over the lease on a theatre downtown and I'm throwing a party tomorrow night to show it off. It's going to be for alternative arts, but I need some help to finish it off, can you put the word out?
I'd like to talk with you about doing some performance poetry here....A weekly thing.
Lawrence is getting derogatory again.
So why don't you get up and speak something, then we will see who is crazy.
Don't give me this Kat, I'm doing it for you and your country.
I'm not going in Doug. I'll wait for you here.
Doug you said you wouldn't be long. Come on, I've got to go. Now!
It's not fair, you hardly talked to me tonight.
Beer please! Do you want another drink?
It was a mistake, I never wanted to hurt you, but it had to end sooner or later and now, well now I love someone else.
Interesting. Do reckon I could fit through here?
Yeah, it's a simple piece. If they get the floor done in time, me and the others will rehearse tomorrow afternoon, but it's not critical.
It is okay........We will paint the wood black, yes?
You mean it's started?
No act of love but willing violence demanded by one and begged by the other. As life turned to fantasy and reality to ecstasy a need, so deep no light could reach, surfaced like a nocturnal creature unearthed for momentary and glorious display. Left alone in a rose-tinted afterglow dimming fast she tasted the moisture of her body and wondered why light came to day and such desires to her pale-skin body.
Seems a shame!
Who you saving the dishes for?
Don't you have a girlfriend?
Head the flyers up with Asylum and then put Debut of....Psychosis, Theatre experimental. That'll cover us if it flops. On the bottom put seek Asylum where the stars shine on Betlemska.
You are playing a very dangerous game, I suggest you make it easy on yourself and tell me where they are.
And the students?
Would you like your things now?
Central station, locker number 139 - combination JFK.
Hey Doug, where you been?
No, just a drill.
All I'm saying Honey is run the thing past me for Christ's sake before you get up and broadcast the crap.
Josh!
It's more than what you're worth.
Will you come home and forget all about him?
Why are there still such headlines?
You know everyone can be controlled Pavel. Where are you storing the personnel files?
So, who is in the building?
That's one girl who can't take a hint.
After he moved out, I invited him to every practice, every game, every parent-teacher conference you ever had. He didn't show, not once.
To see your father?
I have no idea what to say. How to act. What if I do the wrong thing?
Belinda's telling everyone that kiss was real.
Fire is like a living thing. Wild. Unpredictable.
What's with the friggin numbers?
You got some kind of list?
Get very wasted. Lose your virginity --
I'll get something for us to drink --
What is that?
But there are thousands of them, made of floating ice --
Looking for intelligent life?
I'm building a larger one to see the nucleus of Haley's Comet --
No.
The play's going to be really good.
You're not in a very good mood.
Oh. Just not at school...
You were great the other night.
I haven't been nice to you.
All of it.
Okay. Maybe some of that is true --
It's a start.
So you're talking to me?
It's only 7:30.
Before we do this.
It's about working with what you already have -- right now -- at your fingertips -- you know, spontaneously.
Excuse me?
You're acting like a crazy person.
One of your secrets.
You're going to take a year off? Join the Peace Corps -- ?
Jamie --
I'm so sorry. I'm a coward --
I made you do too many things, kept you up all night --
Are you frightened?
Whatever you need. Whatever Jamie needs. I'm here.  I could start by driving her to school --
You're in the play?
Apropos of nothing... so. So so so so --
I'd like to take Jamie to dinner on New Year's Eve.
Materially or spiritually?
Landon. You go on home.
I've almost finished the rocker. Did she order mirrors?
You have materials for the side bearings?
Shall I give you a few ideas?
Besides attending all your regular classes, I'd like you to help our janitorial staff after school --
For the inner satisfaction it will bring.  Saturday mornings, I'd like you to tutor disadvantaged students at our sister school --
I'd gladly write you a letter of recommendation.
What else? What kind of triangle has three sides of different lengths.
This... is the number one single?
I don't get it. How come there's no rock 'n roll?
It's polyester.
Huh?
Hi, Marty.
You remember me...?
Well, I was on my way to school, and I just wanted to stop by and see if you were feeling okay.  You seemed like you were in pretty bad shape the other night.
Are you all right, Marty? You seem a little...nervous.
I think I know exactly what you mean.
Now, George! Dinner's ready now!
Uh, hi, Eileen.
Huh?
How many times do I have to explain it to you?... We know you're not a fighter. You know it, I know it... but she doesn't know it. That's why we gotta make you look like a fighter, somebody who'll stand up for her, somebody who isn't chicken. And you're not gonna look like a fighter if you can't hit me in the stomach.
You're not picking a fight, you're coming to her rescue. Maybe we'd better go over the plan again. Where are you gonna be at 8:55?
Okay. So right around 9:00 she's gonna get very angry with me -
You have a name?
March 11th.
Been any place unusual in the past twelve hours?
The power of a million hydrogen bombs!  ...and we get twenty four measly volts. It's not fair! I've been working on this power converter since 1949, and you'd think in all that time, I could find the right chemicals that would efficiently convert radiation into electric energy! But no! Thirty three years of dedication and research, and all I've got to show for it is a bootleg video operation!
Shemp is right here in this room...two minutes from now, and at exactly 9:02PM, we'll catch up to him.
Of course. Shemp is unaware that anything even happened, other than his stool suddenly falling over. We had to wait two minutes to catch up to him, but for Shemp the trip was instantaneous.
I told you not to interfere with any of the events of this time! Nobody's supposed to see you here! What if I was a mailman? Or a salesman?
I am serious. If we could get you, the time machine, and the power converter in the vicinity of an atomic blast, we could send you back to the future.
Apparently, what has happened is that the maternal instinct has transcended the gap of time and this has caused an alteration in your mother's emotional behavior.
Thanks for everything, Pro.
What year is this?
Sweet and what?  Maybe you'd better pay for this first.
What happened to Dick Wilson?
Hi. where's Cato?
Oh yeah?
No... You go in there, I'll have to kill you.
Nah, skip that... I'm going to have to keep an eye on you, though.
You promise to stay down there for an hour?
Catch!
What you been doing?
Oh yeah?
You ever had to open it up like that before?
Well, Kit...
I mean it.
Sure is pretty.
What do you think you're doing? Go on, get out of here.
No, you're not either.
Jack.
Listen, Holly, you want to take a walk with me?
Doing what?
Well, I know what my daddy's going to say.
Yeah.
Hi.
Quit my job.
You're a redhead.
You know what I think?
That we should crunch our hands with this stone. That way we'd never forget what happened today.
Whatcha looking in there for? We can't afford any of that.
Yeah, you look tired... Listen, honey. when all this is over, I'm going to sit down and buy you a big, thick steak.
Later we found out she was deaf and we hadn't even known it.
Boy. I had a feeling today was going to be the day... Helicopter.
Sorry to barge in on you. Anybody else here besides you two?
You're my friend, aren't you?
Who are you?
All these people applied for drivers' licenses in the same town in New Jersey on the exact same date.
November 1, thirty days have September, April, June, and November...when short February's done, all the rest have thirty-one. October 31st!  Halloween!  Don't you get it?  Orson Welles!
Halloween. 1938..."War of the Worlds"...that fake radio news broadcast that got everybody scared, thinking that real live Martians were landing in Grover's Mill, New Jersey!  But then it all just turned out to be a hoax.
There's another one we owe 'em.
See 'em?  They about had me and the whole damn car for breakfast. Broke my windshield...
What?
Ever since that phony phone call from the President.  Look at this. What is it?
I'm starving...somebody, help.
What crate?
Everybody ready?  How do we look?  Do we look okay?
They're arachtoids, Buckaroo, from Planet 10!
Where're you goin'?
And they got Penny!  Look!
They're armed for bear, Buckaroo.  Check out those radiation levels.
Was she pretty?
You keep an eye on it.
Oh, my.
Never.
What's his problem?
Pick those up, Reno.
Reno, how's about you take New Jersey's gear, mosey on over to the bus and introduce him to the rest of the hands.
So where's Buckaroo?
That's why I wear a fifty dollar hat.  Was a two hundred dollar hat, I hadda kill you.
Now twenty seconds downrange...Perfect Tommy, how on earth is Buckaroo able to keep that thing on the ground?
...Well that doesn't excuse his behavior.
Well I have to come up with  an outline, I'd guess you call it. The story. The whole goddamn story. Soup to nuts. Three acts. The whole goddamn-
Yes, I'm afraid I have.
Well... THIS.
...This'll sometimes help.
So now I'm s'posed to roll over like an ol' bitch dog gettin' ger belly scratched.
Chet!
I write.
How long you been up there, Fink?
Well that's what he said.
I beg your pardon?
What's that?
Don't worry about it. It's just a B picture. I bring it in on budget, they'll book it without even screening it. Life is too short.
...Look, you're confused? You need guidance? Talk to another writer.
A souse!
We have to talk a little business. I've just been on the phone to Los Angeles.  Barton, Capitol Pictures wants to put you under contract. They've offered you a thousand dollars a week. I think I can get them to go as high as two.
Fair enough. No pressure here, Barton, because I respect you, but let me point out a couple of things. One, here you make a difference to five hundred fifty people a night  if the show sells out.  Eighty five million people go to the pictures every week.
...I guess I'm sprouting off again. But I am certain of this, Garland: I'm capable of more good work. Maybe better work than I did in Choirs. It just doesn't seem to me that Los Angeles is the place to lead the life of mind.
Barton? What time is it? Are you all right?
Caught me trying to be fancy! Yeah, that's it, Bart.
And that's the point, that we all have stories. The hopes and dreams of the common man are as noble as those of any king. It's the stuff of life  why shouldn't it be the stuff of theater?  Goddamnit, why should that be a hard pill to swallow? Don't call it new theater, Charlie; call it real theater. Call it our theater.
Well, I don't mean to get up on my high horse, but why shouldn't we look at ourselves up there?  Who cares about the Fifth Earl of Bastrop and Lady Higginbottom and  and  and who killed Nigel Grinch-Gibbons?
Sure you could!  And yet many writers do everything in their power to insulate themselves from the common man  from where they live, from where they trade, from where they fight and love and converse and  and  and... so naturally their work suffers, and regresses into empty formalism and  well, I'm spouting off again, but to put it in your language, the theater becomes as phony as a three dollar bill.
You're all right, Charlie. I'm glad you stopped by. I'm sorry if  well I know I sometimes run on.
...And look, I'm sorry as hell about the interruption. Too much revelry late at night, you forget there are other people in the world.
Howdy, neighbor.
...Got a sweetheart?
My folks live in Brooklyn, with my uncle.
...Probably sounds a little grand coming from someone who's writing a wrestling picture for Wallace Beery.
Jesus, what a day. Felt like I couldn't've sold ice water in the Sahara. Jesus. Okay, so you don't want insurance, so okay, that's your loss. But God, people can be rude. Feel like I have to talk to a normal person like just to restore a little of my...
...Ah, you'll lick this picture business, believe me. You've got a head on your shoulders. What is it they say? Where there's a head, there's a hope?
This kind of heat. It's pathetic.
So they say.
...Jesus, Barton, what the hell is this?  What're we gonna do?
Yeah, but Charlie 
You'll be back?
Never heard of it. Let's move him to the Grand, or the Wilshire, or hell, he can stay at my place.
Yeah... rye whiskey?
Mr. Lipnik, I really would feel much better if you could reconsider 
Yes sir.
I'm sorry if I let you down.
Transient or resident?
Is this multiple choice?
Got a couple questions to ask ya.
Started in Kansas City. Couple of housewives.
Well, some of his throat was there.
...I thought you said you were a writer.
He teach you to do it?
Okay.  I went after him.  I lost my temper.
Where were you tonight?
We got a call from Berkeley P.D. There was a killing.  A professor. Icepick.  In his bed.  Multiple stab wounds.  1977.
As long as Internal Affairs wants you to, I suppose.  Sit down, Nick.
No?
Yes.
I need a cigarette.
How do you know Catherine Tramell saw my reports?
Did I miss something?
You like playing games, don't you?
I passed.
Am I... disturbing you?
You tell me.
I didn't.
How exactly did you hear?
Ice?
Cheers.  My friends call me Catherine.
Bitch mostly, but he meant it affectionately.  You don't have any coke, do you?  I love coke and Jack Daniel's.
Did you think it was so special?
Are you kidding?  You think this is my idea of morning-after conversation?
I thought that business with the scarf was pretty nifty.
I should have known.  I came into the house when you were down on the beach.  She looked at me so strangely.  She left right after you.  I shouldn't have let her watch us. She wanted to watch me all the time.  She tried to kill you, didn't she?
I paid him $50,000 in cash for your psychiatric file.
Do you believe me?
You still think I kill people, don't you?
No thanks.
I hate rugrats.
Did you ever tie him up?
I don't really feel like talking anymore.
You have the right to an attorney.
He was walking home from work. They only lived a coupla blocks from the clinic.  Somebody drove by and shot him.
What kind of talk?
Thanks.
What you doin', son?
You think I --
I'm not afraid of her.
Come on, I'll drive you in this thing.
You're already gettin' psychological input, son.
When was the last time you saw John Boz?
What was the motive?
Are you kidding me?
She's a suspect.
Why do you think he's dead?
Anderson.  Jack W. Donald M.  I'm sorry.  No Lisa.
No Lisa Anderson, detective.
He died -- about five or six years ago.
When's your show?
No. It's one of the few times I feel good. I used to have to go to work and cook every day. That I got sick of.
You wanna buy some ignorant art? Ten bucks.
Jean Michel, this is Mary Boone. She's got the great new gallery.
I wish they'd quit writing this shit about me.
Everybody's paying top dollar for scraps of paper, refrigerator doors  anything with a SAMO tag on it.  The other day, I just wanted a pack of cigarettes, so I did a drawing and sold it for two bucks. A week later this gallery calls me up: "Somebody's offering us the drawing. Should we buy it for five thousand?"
I don't even have any friends anymore besides you. And everyone says "Warhol? That death-warmed over person on drugs? He's just using you."
Bruno called. In Europe, people are saying you're gonna die from drugs. They think they can cash in on your death.
These are great.
It's great that people are interested, but if anyone's going to buy anything, I'll handle it for you. Everything goes through the gallery, even if they come to your studio.
You shouldn't have put it in the show. This is the one I absolutely have to have. I really love it.
Bruno spoke to me already. We could talk about it.
Oh, that's a "Leonardo's Greatest Hits" painting. You like it?
I use a lot of colors  not only black.
It's Andy again.
I knew I left these somewhere. One of these'll send your kids to college someday.  Here  I made this for you.
You're shattering all my myths.
Famous people are usually pretty stupid. You're too smart. You'd get bored to death. You don't wanna be like John Henry  fighting the machine. Just do what you do. It's about integrity. Follow your heart.
We got beat.
She's good.
I don't go there. Too many party girls.
I thought you hated this place?
... What's the matter?
I'm your family.
Basquiat, don't lie.  This is smack.
You look fucking beautiful, beautiful.
Which island of Hawaii do you want our house to be on? Maui? Kaui? Molokai?
What's that?
What? What do you want?
Uh huhh... Band practice?  It's Benny. He wants to know why you're not at band practice...?
So shut up and keep painting..
You don't have any!!!
I need this?
I suppose you feel better now, sir.
Mr. Wayne ... a reminder:  Tonight is that loathsome party, hosted by that odious Mr. Shreck.  May we RSVP in the resoundingly negative?
Well ... Come what may... Merry Christmas, Mr. Wayne.
Where's the fire?
Hey stud:  I thought we had something together.
You're the second man who killed me this week.  But hey, no prob ... I've got seven lives left.
Once you were their freak, now these clowns do your bidding. Must feel pretty good.
Well that's a ... long story ...
Selina.  Hi.  Didn't mean to --
You've got a dark side, Selina Kyle.
Executive Assistant.  Secretary.  Girlfriend?
What went wrong?  Hang on, I think I know ... You kept things from her.
It's the so-called "normal" guys who always let you down.  Sickos never scare me.  At least they're commited.
There's a big, comfy California King over in Bedding.  What say we ...
No.  No glass on the inside.
What happened?
Appetite for destruction? Contempt for the czars of fashion? Wait don't tell me ... Naked sexual charisma?
Y'mean frame him?
Thanks.  Jeez.  Not used to this man-woman, cat-mouse business. Generally the babes flock to me, I tell 'em take a number.
Son!
Yes.  <u>Yes</u>.  Boyfriend trouble ..?
You buy this "blurry" business?
Actually this is all just a bad dream.  You're home in bed. Heavily sedated, resting comfortably, and dying from the carcinogens you've personally spewed in a lifetime of profiteering. Tragic irony or poetic justice? You tell me.
Wonder if it's worth my time.
I don't.  So, no.
Big giant <u>capacitor</u>.  And that, instead of generating power it'll sort of be --  -- <u>sucking</u> power, from Gotham City, and storing it ... stockpiling it, sort of?  Which, unless I'm being dense, is a novel approach, I'd say.
And a very, very good one.
Morning, Max.  Bummer about the store.  You insured?
You certainly will not.
I came to give you your freedom, a chance to live the life you choose. The same gift you gave me.
Don't tell me you're on his side. Again.
I must have dozed off.  My sincerest apologies, sir.
First Ivy had an intoxicating effect on both Dick and me.  Tonight my feelings spread to someone else.
Advanced botany.  DNA splicing. Recombinant animal plant patterns. Pheromone extractions.
Alfred, are you...?
Please be looking for me.
I could have made it, you know.  I didn't need your help.
This is easy.
It'll take the satellites about a minute to re-align, but...damn!
After you have frozen, your icy tomb will plummet back to Gotham.
Mr. Bane, I'll finish off the city. You, as they say in showbiz, are on.  Take the boys and kill the kids. But bring me the Bat.
Go on, kill me too.  Just as you killed my wife.
Watch the first step.
She's definitely part of this.  It's weird, for a while Ivy was all I could think about.  But then...
She's still alive.  He's adapted his freezing technology to reverse McGregor's Syndrome.  He's even found a cure for the early stages of the disease.
We gotta get those locks changed.
Acceptable losses in a battle to save the planet.
Of course.  Alfred still keeps your mother's picture in his room.
I checked the medical database.  No one else is even close.
Or what?  No one can capture Ivy but the big bad Bat.  Crap!  You just want her for yourself.  Don't you?  Answer me, damn it!
You'd say anything to keep me away from her.  To keep her for yourself.
No gun.  How disarming.
My reserves are exhausted.  I must have the gems that power my suit.
In my weakened state I am no match for the bat and the bird.
Their bones will turn to ice.  Their blood will freeze in my hands.
Yes.  I shall replay the world for sentencing me to a life without the warmth of human comfort.  I will blanket the city in endless winter. First Gotham and then the world.
I have created a race of plants with the strength of the deadliest animals.  Once you have frozen mankind, my mutants will overrun the globe.  The Earth will become a brave new world of only plants. And we shall rule them.  For we will be the only two people left in the world.
Inspired, Ms. Ivy.
Freezy, I'm feeling...hot.
Freeze has turned the new telescope into a freezing gun.  He's about to turn Gotham into an ice cube.
Bad luck, I'm afraid.  It's time to die, little bird.
Scholarly research?
If I misinterpreted your interest in the lady, I humbly apologize--
Do you remember the night I fell into that cave and the bat chased me?
Gee, I'm not sure.  Alfred? How many rooms? Total?
It's happening again. Just like my parents. A monster comes out of the night. A scream. Two gunshots. I killed them.
I'm afraid Master Dick has... gone traveling.
There's one other thing. I feel..
I remember a bat. A monster. A demon. Chasing me.  Oh my God, Alfred.
What now sir?
Al?
May I help you, Master Grayson?
He's home. I sent the signal.
Now black rubber.
We all wear masks.
You are direct, aren't you?
Welcome to my parlor said the Riddler to the Bat. How's tricks?
I see without seeing. To me, darkness is as clear as daylight. What am I?
No grape could be more intoxicating than you, my dear. But we make due. To your charms.  Skol.
The infamous Wayne charm. Does it ever shut off?
Patient apparently suffers from acute obsessional syndrome with potential homicidal styles. Work better for you?
I think the question would be, do you have a thing for bats?
But I'm going to have to get you out of those clothes.
Like normal folks.
Me? I'm easy. Especially after a couple of martinis.
But...
Fast work. You just moved here.
A lot of what happened is jagged. Pieces missing. I can't really remember. I just get flashes. Usually in my dreams. I'd kind of gotten used to them. At least accepted them....
Come on, Bruce. This is what I do for a living.
Throw up that ridiculous superficial mask. If you're jealous...
In a sense we are all two people. The side we show in daylight. And that side we keep in shadow.
If I didn't know better, I'd say you were sulking.
There's something I want to talk with you about. It's...Well, we.. I...
But what about all the good we can do? There are monsters out there. Gotham needs us.
Exactly. And once you'd killed him you'd be lost. Like me.  All this has to be a choice. Otherwise...it's a curse.
Edward...
...or death.
No.  Wait...
Sure, E = MC squared. Until you factor in more than three dimensions. Then... Damn. Hit us again.
Yes?
Excuse me, sir.  Commissioner Gordon was compelled to leave - -very unexpectedly.  He asked me to convey his regrets.
I know the feeling. It won't last.  He's a long way ahead of where I was at his age.
Gosh, I could kill you, but then you'd miss my party. And you, Batman -- you're the guest of honor!
You know, we should've sat down and had us a little heart-to-heart. I bet we would have got on famously.
Can't we --
...Not even a 'thank you'?
I'll have to ask you for that film.
They've got it all wrong. They're watching the warehouses, the loading docks, looking for a tamperer. The Joker is supplying tainted ingredients at the source.
"This is Miss Vale." -- That felt redundant.
That's how it is, chum. One column - and I can bring all this tumbling down. I can take you off the streets for good.
I want you to hang up the suit. And I want you to stay away from Vicki.
Do you sail?
There's terror everywhere.  If you train yourself to look for it.
As much as I do.  It's not that.  I don't want to be depressing, that's all.
I don't sing very well.
Vicki?... This is Batman. I thought I'd call and see how you're doing.
We've told him we'll deal. What could he possible have to gain by --
MOVE! Can't you do something??
I missed you, Lieutenant.
I answer to Grissom, punk.  Not to you.
That ain't what I heard.  That ain't what I heard at all.  I heard the bat got him.
And what happens if we say no?
That's it?
Joker here. Can we talk?
No.
I bet they like him for his big charity balls.
Vicki. We got a wealthy millionaire here... who dresses up like a bat. He goes out at night and swings around -- in his cape -- on a rope.  CRAZY BAT-STARD!
Couldn't turn down the job, huh? A girl could get hurt this way.
HOLY SHIT!!
There aren't hotels?
And what did you say?
Jesus.
Liar.
Shut up, Kevin.  Honey, you-re not making sense ...
I know you are.  Very serious ... most of the time these days.
Yes.  And	I have a wine for dinner that will kill you.
Big day today, huh? 78
Ah, Mr Bean ...
What happened?!!!
It wasn't a dream, was it.  I have to go in to work and tell them Whistler's Mother now looks like Danny De Vito.
Howls he getting on with the family?
It's great when people who work together can become real friends.
'Emergency measures, in your book means sack people right?
Say that again, son.
Tomorrow.  You have a problem with that?
The thing is, sir, I've just been giving the painting a very thorough inspection, with the help of Dr Bean here - and we feel the time's come for Whistler's Mum to have her first face-lift.
Brilliant, huh?  I already have a prospective buyer - the current Governor of California, no less, who is flies in tomorrow to inspect her and clinch the deal.  Spread the news.  I think decisive leadership has done the trick, don't you?
I think you're wrong, David.  She looks as fine as she's ever looked. Worth every cent of the 10 million dollar-s.
David, David, David ...
I owe you a very serious apology, young man.  It wouldn't surprise me if you wanted to leave us after this.  I sincerely hope that you do not.
Of course.
Maybe two cars.
Oh come on - the guy's going to be a creep.  All Englishmen are ugly.
All the guys they claim are English to and good-looking like Dan Day- Lewis and Liam Neeson, turn out to be Irish.  Even Anthony Hopkins is welsh.  Prince Charles is so ugly they pay him two million bucks a year to stay indoors.
Welsh.
Welsh again.
Bye, Dad.
Hey, En, nice bike'- but remember: any kids you have are gonna look just like its handsome driver.
You know the thing I hate most about children?
I wish I could use that at school.  "Hey, Teach, no hard feelings ... It's just things between us ain't what they used to be and I need a little space, ya know?  So I'11 see you around in a couple of years, maybe".
What's gone?
Huh huh huh. He said "anus."
Huh huh huh. That was cool.
Uh, B...A...U... No, uh, V...
Huh huh. This says Beavis.
That's Butt-Head. Don't you get it, Beavis. These dudes have the same name as us.
Huh huh huh. That chick was talking about doing it.
Uh... Hey baby. Are we like, doing it?
Huh huh huh. I'm ready for love.
This is dumb, let's find that chick.
Dammit, all they have is shows about water.
That was boring. Huh huh.
Hey, where'd those chicks go?
Heh heh. Fire. Heh heh Aaaaeeehhhhg!!!
Turd-burglar...
Um, uh, butt... um, hole. Butt-hole...
Yeah, heh heh. I'm gonna have money, and a big-screen TV and sluts everywhere!
I'm probably going to make out with her first before we, you know, get down...
Uh... No,  I poop too much. Then I get tired.
Why does everyone wanna see my schlong?  I am the one-and-only-almighty-bungholiooo!
...Two...
Damn right. Bork, we're dealing with real pros here. My opinion, terrorists... What's the scoop on that stolen unit?
Well, I'll be a blue-nosed gopher.
What the hell...? Bork! That bus we picked up. Where was it headin'?
Say chief, isn't that guy whose camper,...I mean, off in whose...
Do her? Huh huh.
You got two seconds!
Who sent ya?
Muddy! Sonofabitch! Hold it. What's he payin' ya?
Maybe I am three-eighty-five if you carry a second lien!  I can arrange the most creative financing in the six states of New England.
You'll be rich!
Adam my booyy!  When you're really rich in what matters...  ... nothing matters!  My buyer has just made a killing in condos in the Village.  And he's got a little stress problem...  ... so his wife says they want the old peace and quiet!
Get <u>away</u> you little monster.
She's ready.
Wave at the lion.
You're doing it, Adam.  You're saving this town.
You'd better sit down, hon.
I'll tell you what, Barbara.  I don't think we survived that crash.
Adam, we <u>are</u> in hell.  I hate these people.
Look in the index... maybe there's, like an emergency number or something.
What about this Beetle guy?
I feel really stupid.
Well, I don't know... We don't get many visitors.
Adam, you had a photo of Big Foot!
Did you copy these gravestones right, Adam?
Has anything been simple so far? From the look of the shovel, we dig.
But <u>we</u> let him out.
You know, I've been thinking.  I could teach Lydia to sew.
What...?
What?
Help vouchers?
Wait for who?
<u>So</u> you, the dead, want me, <u>the</u> <u>undead</u>, to throw the live guys -- Mommie, Daddy and Lolita, who might not mind a tumble with an older guy, out into the cold? Even though they have paid hard casharoonie for your dump?
Handbook?  When...?
Just one daughter.
No.
Honey -- today I am three hundred <u>fifty</u> thousand dollars!
Look at me, think of me as cash! This offer is really real!  From a rich man in New York City who only saw a photograph!
Mr. and Mrs. Maitland?  I've come for the last time.  Where are you?  Barb...
No, I mean they've gone. Decamped.  Split.  Vanished.
Sort of.  High spirit.  Heh heh. Listen, cookie, I've been trapped in this burg for hundreds of years.  All I want is to get out.
Minor problem.  The rules.  I can't tell it to you.  But... do you know how to play charades?
Three syllables.
Breakfast beetle?  Beetle?  Beetle fruit?  Fruit bat?  Fruit battle? Volkswagen?  Fruit wagon?
God, you're anatomically correct!
You were the snake!  Right?  I know.  I saw you.
No I don't.  I don't take orders from smurfs.
Yes, of course you are.  Well, Otho had an intuition.  Call it a hunch -- that it was going to be a fabled monstrosity of a house.  And it certainly is.  Charles, you're lucky the Yuppies are buying condos, so you can afford what I'm going to have to do to this place. We are talking <u>from the ground</u> <u>ups'ville</u>!
Otho, you've got to help me get Maxie Dean up here.  I have a deal that could make all of us very comfortable.
Otho'll know what to do.
Just don't tell Lydia.
Lydia, relax.  We'll build you a darkroom in the basement.
Skeleton keys never work.  Anyway, this can wait.  We'll get a crowbar later.  Your mother...
Stepmother's...
The attic room is locked --
Not <u>a building</u>!  That's the beauty of it.  I think I can buy the <u>whole town</u>.  These people don't know the value of their property!
Great idea, Maxie!  Those Japanese could <u>run</u> it for us.  Build them a dormitory in the woods.  Listen, think right about it, will you? We've almost got the house ready, you bring Sarah with you and I'll show you.
I can't believe you are doing this to me!  <u>Ghosts</u>.  I am giving a dinner party for seven people tonight.  Otho has agreed to come back for the demolition of the attic.  My agent, Bernard, is bringing some woman who writes for <u>Architectural Digest</u>.  In fact, no one here tonight has not been in <u>Vanity Fair</u>.  Except you.
Lydia tried to play a most amusing joke on me this afternoon.
Look at that <u>detail</u>!
Is this the key to the attic?
All presences have a home space. A place where they live, so to speak.  Where do they hide out?
It's good that there was no apparent damage to the bone.
Thomas? Who's Thomas?
Then you wish to handle this matter through your attorneys?
Oh, I see...  ... Well, then... You're a very funny man, Mr. Gardiner. You caught me off guard, I must admit...
... Benjamin has been hounding me to allow him to address the annual meeting of his Financial Institute today, but obviously, the strain would be impossible... How about here, Chauncey, any soreness?
... Were you going somewhere?
He does, does he?
... He's gone, Chauncey.
... Do you think we should look for him?
Of course, Doctor, I understand.
Well, Mr. President... They don't quite know what to think.
I understand. I've never seen anything like this on television.
I would like to watch television.
May I ask your name?
Oh... Mr. Gardiner... Mr. Chauncey Gardiner... You're not related to Basil and Perdita Gardiner are you?
Won't your injury prevent you from attending to business, Mr. Gardiner?
Chauncey!
Your leg must be getting better.
... Chauncey... Last night you mentioned an old man, that died.
I'm sorry...  ... And what about Louise? YOU mentioned that she had gone, were you close to her also?
Chauncey! Have you seen the papers?
I know you are, Chauncey...  ... You conquer a woman from within herself, you infuse in her the need and desire and the longing for your love.
Upstairs? Chauncey, you're always involved in some sort of discussion...
... Come in, Chauncey - please come in...
To watch...? To watch me...?
Hello, Mr. Gardiner. This is Sid Courtney, Washington Post.
Of course. But since he is ill I'm taking the liberty of asking you.
I see. Then one more quick question, Mr. Gardiner; since we at the Post would like to, uh - update our profile on you - what exactly is your business?
Of course, Mr. Gardiner, the fact that you occupy such a position in the world of finance makes you ideally suited to provide our millions of viewers with an explanation of this nation's economic crisis.
Do you realize, Mr. Gardiner, that more people will be watching you tonight than all those who have seen theater plays in the last forty years?
Do you need a doctor? I could call Robert...
To exchange our thoughts - what does a Russian know about business? On the other hand, what does an American know about diplomacy?
Yes, it is very good!
I feel very good in here.
Failure of the bone marrow to produce red blood cells... Not a damn thing they can do about it. Oh, they can make me comfortable, prolong my life with steroid therapy and transfusions... And what makes my blood boil, what little I have left, that is, Mr. Gardiner - is that it's generally a young person's disease... Here I am, getting on in years and about to die of a young person's disease...
Do we have a garden? Hah! Tomorrow, Chauncey, you will see our gardens.
Bravo!
No, Ben.
Yes. I would like to escort Eve.
We could do it now, we can go upstairs.  ... Please, it's time for us. Come upstairs.
Of course, who can nowadays? I have trouble writing a post card to my children! Look, we could give you a six figure advance, provide you with the very best ghostwriter, research assistants, proof readers...
Of course not! No one has the time to read! One glances at things, watches television...
... Did you wish to see someone, sir?
This is terrible, sir -  I hope you're not badly injured...
How long do we stay in here?
... Evening, Chance.
... I see.
Come now, Mr. Gardiner, before his speech at the Financial Institute the President consulted with you and Benjamin Rand, did he not?
I'm sorry to say that our time is running short, but before we close, I'd like to ask one final question. What sort of gardener, sir, would you be?
Mr. Chance, perhaps you could show us some identification with your address -- a Driver's License, a credit card, checkbook?
What are your plans now, Mr. Chance?
Do you agree with Ben, Mr. Gardiner? Are we finished? Or do you think we can stimulate growth through temporary incentives?
... In the garden?
Yes. It has.
... Sid, be reasonable - I've been everywhere, there's no place left to check!
Oh, it wasn't all that bad, darling. We were fortunate that Mr. Gardiner turned out to be so reasonable.
Do you feel well enough for that?
I shall take the gentleman to the third floor guest suite, ma'am. Dr. Allenby is standing by.
Oh, I've been just dying to meet you, Mr. Gardiner!
Come on, Eve. Let's let the men talk, there are so many people that have been asking about you.
... Maybe you should talk to somebody, darling.
... Is it me? Is there something I've done?
It's your damn job. It never happened when you were a senator...
I can certainly understand that...
... What do you make of all this?
... Business, bullshit! Going out in the middle of the night to meet that bitch in a bar...
Yes? What have you found?
But... Where was this man Gardiner before last week?
I see. Clearly, such interest on their part is of great political significance.
Hmmm... Take this down.  I want this quote included in the Tass coverage; 'Chauncey Gardiner, in an intimate discussion with Ambassador Skrapinov, noted that "Unless the leaders of the opposing political systems move the chairs on which they sit closer to each other, all of their seats will be pulled from under them by rapid social and political changes."'
We have word that the Soviets have put out a top priority alert for information on Gardiner's background. So far, they haven't come up with a thing - what's more, as a result of their eagerness, one of their ablest agents blew his cover, we have him in custody at this time.
You have proven that already, Comrade Skrapinov, you are to be congratulated for recognizing the importance of this man and establishing an early friendship.
Ben!
... There is no longer any margin for inflation, it has gone as far as it can, you've reached your limits on taxation, dependence on foreign energy has reached a crisis, and, from where I see it, Mr. President, the Free Enterprise System has reached the breaking point. We are on the brink of another crash from which recovery might not be possible.
John! Great to see you! Sorry about the cunt at reception.
I'll get right to the point, Larry. I'm a puppet now...
I don't know.
Enjoy.
We've been over this. Nobody's looking for a puppeteer in today's wintry economic climate.
Which one is Elijah again?
Did you eat?
The iguana.
I dressed the wound. Then I've just been feeding everyone, putting everyone to bed.
Now?
Why?
Nothing. Don't go, Craig. I've been thinking. Let's try to work this out. We've got so much history.
I'm getting rid of the fucking animals.
You've always hated the animals.
Don't forget me.
Sometimes we're forced to make hard decisions.  I'd like for us to stay together, Craig. You know, platonically, if that's possible. I truly value our friendship.
Tell her, what the hell, close early today, live dangerously.
You didn't do anything about it out of respect for the fact that she wouldn't let you near her with a ten foot pole, which is, by the way, about nine feet, nine inches off the mark anyway.
I need a shower.
You're not a monster, Craig. Just a confused man.
It's Elijah.
A better friend.
Yeah. I was going to kill him from the inside.
People make mistakes.
Holy shit! He said what I said!
Mr. Malkovich, my name is Craig Schwartz. I can explain. We operate a little business her that... simulates, for our clientele, the experience of... being you, actually.
Sure, after a fashion.
Please have a seat, Mr. Juarez...
Pardon?
Money, Miss Warts?
You're not like the other boys we've had here. Granted, I can't understand what you're saying either, but your soft palette resonates tremendously well and you never ever constrict your epiglottis.
No. I understand perfectly.
Imagine a room full of women. Nubile, blonde, wet with desire, Schwartz. A harem, if you will. Me in leather. A harness, if you like. I am the object of this desire, and all eyes are on me as I speak. Ladies, I begin. I am the love god, Eros. I intoxicate you. My spunk is to you manna from heaven...
Wife, huh? I'd love to meet her, Craig.
Shall we say dinner on Friday. Just the two of us?  You can come too if you like, Schwartz.
Uh, import-export. Olive oil. Right on 7 1/2 actually.  In the vacant office. So we'll still be seeing each other.
You're making a big mistake, Schwartz.  Ma'am
There are rules, boy, procedures, etiquette. This is not a toy. I've been waiting seventy years to utilize this room, grooming myself, quietly setting the stage, performing ablutions, paying tribute, seeing all his motion pictures again and again. Worshipping, Schwartz, worshipping properly.
Moving story.
Who told you?
Made it. Maxine. Maxine, Maxine, Maxine.
What'll you have?
No, no, it's your energy or your attitude or the way you carry yourself or...
So, tell me about yourself. If you can get your mind out of the gutter long enough, dog-boy.
This is important!
Lots of things. He's very well respected. That jewel thief movie, for example. The point is that this is a very odd thing, supernatural, for lack of a better word. It raises all sorts of philosophical questions about the nature of self, about the existence of the soul. Am I me? Is Malkovich Malkovich? Was the Buddha right, is duality an illusion? Do you see what a can of worms this portal is? I don't think I can go on living my life as I have lived it. There's only one thing to do. Let's get married right away.
You're late.
I've fallen in love.
Lotte? Is that you?
Let him try.
I'll be with you always, my friends. Who knows, maybe if I'm lucky, I'll rejoin you with wings and a beak.
Two hundred dollars, please.
Forget it.
Thank you, Floris.
It's like nothing I've ever felt before. I think I'm going crazy.
Kevin, I'm telling you... it was like nothing I've...
I don't know anything about her. What if she's some sort of witch or something?
I gotta know the truth, Kevin.
Anybody else?
I blew it, Dr. Lester.
What?! That is not allowed. My God, you are supposed to be one of us. You know you must never partake of Malkovich by yourself!
Yes, hello, I wanted to place an ad.  Hi, are you Craig's wife?
Never heard of it.
Can I get you a drink?
Yes, yes, sweetheart, yes!  What the fuck is going on? I'm not talking. This is not me!
Well, we'll have all the money in Malkovich's bank account, plus he still gets acting work occasionally.
Sleepy suddenly.
Bad dream, darling?
Good-bye, Maxine.
You got to go sometime. You got to go out there by yourself sometime.
You saying nothing counts?
You punishing Him, ain't you?
They'll be all right. I'm surprised they lasted here this long.
...All I remember is how she loved the bottom of burned bread. Her little hands...I wouldn't know 'em if they slapped me".
CAN THEY GET IN HERE?
You don't sit with me!! I don't sit with people who leave me!
You're weren't nice to me..you didn't smile at me..
Not for me, you don't! You don't let me eat the pies...
That girl...You know, Beloved...
She gone like they say?
Miss Bodwin. They brother and sister, darlin.
Be here. In case.
No. I mean work work.
You know he's colored? What else there to know?
It's her, ain't it?
You?
They'll know. They'll know as soon as they born. Cause it's inside us,Stamp. It'll be inside them. We'll pass it down. Schoolteacher didn't just change the outside, he changed the mind..and the blood..and what it carries...and what it's worth..
She scares me. I scare me. And that girl in her house scares me.
Tell me something, Stamp. Tell me this one thing. How much is a nigger supposed to take?
I'm tired, Paul. So tired. I have to rest a while.
Yeah?
Fuck.
Pin your diapers on, Lebowski.  Jackie Treehorn wants to see you.
Well, enjoy, and perhaps we'll see you again some time, Dude.
We've had some terrible news.  Mr. Lebowski is in seclusion in the West Wing.
Mr. Lebowski is prepared to make a generous offer to you to act as courier once we get instructions for the money.
Where'd she been?
Fuck, man!  That's terrible!
VEE FUCK YOU UP, MAN!  VEE TAKE YOUR MONEY!
NUSSING!
What's this?
Yeah, well, what do you care, Walter?
Sheesh.
I was bowling--
What's a pederast, Walter?
Shut the fuck up, Donny!  V.I. Lenin! Vladimir Ilyich Ulyanov!
Who has your undies, Walter?
And then they're gonna stamp on it?!
Are you gonna split hairs?
What do you need that for, Dude?
Those are good burgers, Walter.
Are they gonna hurt us, Walter?
--So he says, "My son can't hold a job, my daughter's married to a fuckin' loser, and I got a rash on my ass so bad I can't hardly siddown. But you know me.  I can't complain."
--had a rough night, and I hate the fucking Eagles, man--
Please, feel free to inspect them.
No, they--
--without  the means  for higher education, so Mr. Lebowski  has committed  to sending  all of them to college.
One--oh!  Heh-heh.  You never went to college?
Sometimes.  I wouldn't hold out much hope for the tape deck though.  Or the Creedence tapes.
I like your style, Dude.
Wouldn't miss the semis.  How things been goin'?
I've heard the kidnapping story, so save it.  I know you're mixed up in all this, Dude, and I don't care what you're trying to take off her husband.  That's your business.  All I'm saying is, I want mine.
Is that what that's a picture of?
Lord.  You can imagine where it goes from here.
Do you have any news regarding my father's money?
From who?
Her "co-star" in the beaver picture?
Roy Orbison. . . Pink Floyd.
Well...yeah--
Increases?
So...that doctor.
What's your point, Walter?
No, but--
Hey man--
Come on Walter, it's just--it's Smokey.  So his toe slipped over a little, it's just a game.
That's your answer to everything, Dude.  And let me point out--pacifism is not--look at our current situation with that camelfucker in Iraq-- pacifism is not something to hide behind.
The what?
We?  What the fuck we?  You said you just wanted to come along--
Yes you're wrong.  This isn't a fucking game, Walter--
Oh shit.  Walter.
We can't do that, Dude.  That fucks up our plan.
The bridge is coming up!  Gimme the ringer, Dude!  Chop-chop!
What the fuck?
Aitz chaim he, Dude.  As the ex used to say.
No, Walter!  I said I thought she kidnapped herself!  You're the one who's so fucking certain--
But Walter, we didn't make the fucking hand- off!  They didn't get, the fucking money and they're gonna-- they're gonna--
Walter--
"Our" car, Walter?
You want a toe?  I can get you a toe, believe me.  There are ways, Dude.  You don't wanna know about it, believe me.
Thanks Walter.
Who the fuck is that?
Walter, if you're there, pick up the fucking phone.  Pick it up, Walter, this is an emergency.  I'm not--
I mean we totally fucked it up, man. We fucked up his pay-off.  And got the kidnappers all pissed off, and the big Lebowski yelled at me a lot, but he didn't do anything.  Huh?
You're fucking Polish Catholic--
And you were divorced five fucking years ago.
Hey, cool it Walter.  Listen, pal, there never was any money.  The big Lebowski gave me an empty briefcase, man, so take it up with him.
Hy God!  They shot him, Walter!
There weren't any shots.
It's a heart attack.
WHERE'S THE FUCKING MONEY, SHITHEAD!
Dude, this is Smokey.  Look, I don't wanna be a hard-on about this, and I know it wasn't your fault, but I just thought it was fair to tell you that Gene and I will be submitting this to the League and asking them to set aside the round.  Or maybe forfeit it to us--
Shut the fuck up.  Hello?
Dude here.
Huh?  No, she, she hit me right here.
Where's my goddamn money, you bum?!
Well sure, look at it!  Young trophy wife, I mean, in the parlance of our times, owes money all over town, including to known pornographers-- and that's cool, that's cool-- but I'm saying, she needs money, and of course they're gonna say they didn't get it 'cause she wants more, man, she's gotta feed the monkey, I mean-- hasn't that ever occurred to you...? Sir?
Well?  Aren't you?
Oh, shit.
Shit, sorry man.
Bullshit. Walter!
Yeah, but--
I'm not--
You happy, you crazy fuck?
<i>You'll</i> take him.
Seems like he's doing me a favor, then.
You've been training two years to take me out.  Here I am, the big, bad vampire hunter.  So do it.
What is it with you people and pain?
What was that?
Which means he turned about seventy-two hours ago.
No hemoglobin left. Their metabolisms are too fast.  They burn out.  That's why they're having to feed so often.  Their systems are self destructing.
Why do you hate us so much?
What do you want me to do?
You came back for me.
Your security's for shit, kid.
What's your problem, Whistler?
And so will we.
Must be hundreds of these skeletons here.
Put it back in park, Blade.
Motion sensors.  Looks like Zone Three.
Nomak?
So that's down and dirty.  Got anything to say for yourself?
Yes?
Any casualties?
An inevitability, I suppose.  Nyssa was not among them, I trust.
Nobody to call in case of an emergency?
Where'd you dig up this shit-bird anyway?
Yeah, your little cootchie knew.
Get in. Youre leaving.
Who dies first?
Yes. The vampire apocalypse. It is said that all who feel its taint will succumb to the Thirst.
How did you know?
You used me as bait?!
Look, if what you say is true, if there's a chance I could turn into one of them, then I've got no choice, do I? I have to work with you. I need to learn everything I can about them. It's the only way I'll be able to find a cure for myself.
Graffiti --
I know this place -- it's a blood bank.
I can't close my eyes without hearing her scream.
My mother used to say that a cold heart is a dead heart.
This isn't human blood.
The red blood cells are biconvex, which is theoretically impossible. They're hypochromic, there's virtually no hemoglobin in them.  Look at the PMNs, they're binucleated, they should be mononucleated.
I thought you promised to give me some distance?
You haven't started in on the internal organs?
That's weird --
I see. And what would you have us do with this "half-breed"?
These archives are restricted to members of the House of Erebus.
How many of you are there?
LaMagra isn't a physical being. He's a spirit, requiring a flesh and blood host in order to manifest himself.
Blade --
So what do you use, then? A stake?
Consider it a parting gift. Vampire mace -- silver nitrate, essence of garlic.
Whistler!
'Give you a hand. I think my sleep for the night just ended.
What do you mean?
What, are you alright?
You killed Domini, didn't you, witch??
--Jamie Kurth, Jonathan Edmunds--
Something was wrong.
The bitched-out babe in back here is one Anna Tassio--we met one dark and stormy night in a Blair Witch chat room, we all did--
What's she look like?
Yeah, so?
This is funny?? This is tens of thousands of fucking dollars!  You pricks! I'll see you in fucking court!!
Cheery little place.
No.
--do you <u>agree</u> it's that <u>old</u>, Nick?
The rest of the family was crazy as Rusty Parr.
No offense, sweetheart: fuck you.
--now c'mon!
Nothing. I dunno--
--like you hurt the baby--
Oh, Jesus, no--
Absolutely.
I know you're in there, you piece of shit!
It's my fucking <u>job</u>, man!!
<u>One</u> set. Everything from midnight on--
How'd you know they were--
My ass--you saw those four fucking baboons put 'em there!
I don't know yet.
This is a little nuts.
There, what? I didn't see anything.
Can't you like just divine it?
The witch?
--yeah, a hand or something--
English.
--they're from UMass, doing some kind of fucking term paper--
We're not making Blair Witch II here.
Either way, maybe there's a book in it, and they both make a ton of money.
They're making "Blair Witch II," too.
<u>What</u>?
--and none of 'em were mine! I-am-so-fucked, I-am-so-fucked-- where the hell was everybody???
Cotter, I think she's right. Why would those guys go to all the trouble of stealing the camera and all this other stuff and leave the tapes?
403 41st Street, kids: home.
Just hold on!
Why was <u>she</u> exempted, Nick?
Look at those marks--just like in the movie.
--sacred and occult Scotch Tape.
That's almost a year's worth of work!  Scumbags! Oh, Jesus, Jesus....
Women miscarry all the--
That'd be up on your shoulder, maybe your lower back.
For a blur?
You gonna be alright?
What're you afraid's going to happen?
She <u>wasn't</u> a witch.
Okay. Hypothetically.
Spare me.
I can't do it!
No. We <u>all</u> go.
"It's why the witch kills children."
Why?
It's <u>possible</u> for chrissake--
....Ma'am?
Your mother's pastor.
...He sent me to a psychiatrist to see if he could calm me down some.
Psychiatrist said I was the healthiest person he'd ever met, so Marty fired him.
...You all right?
...You called me this morning.
Well... what happened?
...That's the only thing they told us in the service that was worth a goddamn--Where the hell's my windbreaker?
...You leaving?
...But first I gotta know what happened.
...I don't know, wasn't it you? Maybe a burglar broke in, and you found--
So how long have you know Meurice?
...So what're you doing tonight?
It'll pass.
...He gave me a little pearl-handled .38 for out first anniversary.
What's the matter?
...What was that back there?
Yeah.
I don't particularly want to talk to you.
Then what'd you come here for?
...You get a refund though, if you tell me who else she's been sluicing.
Well, I don't know... Call it a fringe benefit.
...Anything else?
...Well, if the pay's right and it's legal I'll do it.
...Gee, I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me what you want me to do or is it a secret?
Well what?
I'm supposed to do a murder--two murders--and just trust you not to go simple on me and do something stupid. I mean real stupid. Now why should I trust you?
...What?
...What?
...Count it if you want.
Yeah, I know. Pour 'em short.
What's this?
Red Label.
This.
That's not the point.
Howdy stranger.
...Why?
What day is it today, Angie?
I think it's important not to get depressed. Depression is a terrible thing. They say it can bring on illness.
Doctor Gynde. my whole family's sick. What's going on?
Will you tell Mom when she gets home from the hospital that I've gone to dinner at Sandy Williams' house?
Oh yeah?. Have you seen any?
Frank, I have something for you. Excuse us everyone.
See you Tuesday, Frank.
Is that why you say it's horrible?
Because of your information I alerted internal affairs to check out Detective Gordon.  I had to keep on with him as if nothing was different.  He slipped off on his own when he found out we were going to raid Frank's place.
Hello, daddy.
Yes, but.
Don't say PLEASE, Fuckhead. WHAT ARE THESE?
Yeah, maybe so. Frank's got me. and you. and really it's all thanks to Don. isn't it. remember that. Your husband was the one who started fucking my mind with drugs.
You tell me!! Let me see that wallet.  Jeffrey Beaumont. What're you doing in my apartment, Jeffrey Beaumont?
An experiment? Hey, I've seen you before.
That's right. That's what I said. You have a good memory. Then what?
What do you want from me?
Yes.
Do you like me?
Next Christmas. Is he Santa Claus who has left a present for Dorothy? What was it? An ear? Another ear?!!  What was it?
. I. uh.
Oh shit.
Nice guy.  Who's he?
Who is Don?
Do you like my body?
Do you want to do bad things?  Anything. anything.
Do you love me?
There's no disease, I can tell you.
I'll call you.
What?
No thanks.
I don't want to go.
Don't be a good neighbor to her or I'm gonna send you a love letter. straight from my heart, fucker. You know what a love letter is? It's a bullet. straight from my gun, fucker. Once you get a love letter from me, you're fucked forever. Understand, Fuck?
What else is new?. right?
I'm home from school. My father's in the hospital.
Do you know who was brought in for questioning?
You really do hear a lot, don't you?
I have to help out in my father's hardware store. they're giving me sort of my own hours for a while. which is nice.
I guess so. Like you said. It's a strange world.
I'd like to talk to you about something.
I don't want to cause any trouble.
You said it was a strange world. and you're the strangest part of it. Are you crazy.she is possibly involved in murder. This gives me the creeps.
It wouldn't hurt to hear the plan, I guess.
What will I say when she comes to the door?
Now. we'll walk over so there's no license plates and you give me at least three minutes. I can stall if it's more, but I need time to find a good window .alright?
Are you alright?
Yeah, but don't pick me up. my father may think it's strange. I'll walk over to your house. I'll be there at eight o'clock.
I'd like an ice-cold Heineken.
Here's to. an interesting experience.
. I wish you wouldn't do this.  It doesn't make any sense. Let's go somewhere and have some coffee.
I. I don't want to see you tomorrow. Mike's coming over.
Call tomorrow. It's okay. Good luck. I hope you can sneak out okay. You're going to wait until she's asleep?
That's for me to know and for you to find out. I'll see you. I mean call you. okay?
I'm sorry, I didn't.
Wow. Should you tell my father?
Yeah?
You're sure right. It is a strange world.
I don't know. I had a dream. in fact. the night I met you.  . in the dream the world was dark because there weren't any robins. you know, birds. robins stood for love. and all of a sudden thousands of robins flew down and brought this blinding light of love. and it felt like that love would be the only thing that would make any difference. I guess. until the robins come there is trouble.
Can I give you a kiss good night?
Number two. I saw the Yellow Man come out. This time with a well-dressed man with an alligator briefcase. They drove down this factory building and stood on a staircase looking at something in the distance. Number three. now get this. In the distance was a murder. a drug dealer shot to death and a woman with her legs broken.
Then these guys told me the police will find a huge amount of drugs inside the dead man's place.
I should never had gotten you going on this.  Yes Jeffrey. Friday's on!
Really?
Oh my God. What's wrong?
Are you feeling okay?
Where's all your things, Jeffrey?
What?
I just wanted to ask him a few questions, that's all. Maybe I better go.
Mrs. Williams? Thanks for the cake.
Sandy?. Could I talk to you a minute?
Norman Cay is not a person.  He is an island, George.  In the Bahamas.  From what they say, it is free and it's Diego's new home.
Yes.  Jack Stevens is already a very busy man.  Along with many others.  You shouldn't stay away so long.
Three-hundred kilos is a very big load, Georgie.  Why don't we start small?
I'm so glad you two could make it. Mirtha, look at you.  So beautiful.  You look like you're about to burst.
Are you sure you're okay?  You're pale.
I'm taking you to the doctor when we get home, and I don't want to hear any arguments.
Two years.  George, I can't wait that long.
Not so fast.  I would like to go over the details.
I know what you want.  But, first of all, are you cops?
What the fuck is that?
I don't know...
Half a million for you.  Half a million for me.  One-point-three five for the Colombians.
Look, I'm sorry about everything.  I feel like an idiot.  You were right.  I did fuck you.  And then Diego fucked me. Cut me out, too.
You?
I want my kid out of protective custody. Now.  No fucking around.  My wife and my kid on a plane tonight.  I sign when they call me safe and sound.
What do you got there, Diego?
What kind of project?
I've got to get out of here, Diego.
Do we need a plane?  How does this work? When do I see you?
This is only part of the business, George.  A very small part.  Don't worry, there is so much more to do. Which reminds me, I need a favor from you.  I must go to Colombia.
Touche.
Where do I put this!?
I love you, my brother, do you know that?
Derek Foreal.
He's in tachycardia.  George, your heart is racing.  Have you been using drugs?
Barbara.
G-d, son.
It's a family heirloom.
Layaway shmayaway.
I like you, George.  You are loyal. That is good.  That is rare.  Maybe crazy.  Yes.  I can tell already.  You are like me.  I look at you and I see myself.  It's in the eyes, no, George?
What do I think?  I don't want my answer to be influenced by what I want, so I'm going to have to say I don't know.
Keep them coming.
Please.  Sit down.  We'll drink some scotch.
I know.
What are you going to do?
You mad at me?
Yeah, you are.  I can tell by the way you look at me.
Hi.
How are you doing, George?
Figured it out.
Look what the cat dragged in.
Hello.
Why are you smiling?
I don't know.  My name is George.
Look, Mirtha.  She's walking.
Not in front of the kid.
Yeah.
He wants me to testify?  Is that what he's asking me to do?
Everything's gonna be okay, sweetheart. Don't be upset.
I don't know.
I don't want, alright?  It's not funny. I'm really pissed off, George.  You blew it, now leave me alone.
What do you want from me?
You let me take care of your mother. You just pack your bags.
Mr. Jung, do you know Diego Delgado?
Good to see you, Jorge.  You are a man of your word.
I'm on vacation.  On my way back to school.
Right on.
Yeah?
It's not enough.
I can't believe we're stealing a plane.
Colonel Mathieu ... Much has been said lately not only of the successes obtained by the paratroopers, but also of the methods that they have employed ... Can you tell us something about this?
Second district ... Explain better ...
You afraid of these ...?
What's happened to you?
How much are they paying you?
Even that could be a trick. You escape, then show up at the address which the brothers in prison gave to you, and so you are able to contact me ...
But I haven't shot him.
And how many are we?
No, and neither were my men.
Mathieu! Mathieu, a name ...
And so the tapeworm no longer has a head. Are you satisfied, Mathieu? In Algiers everything should be over.
Bah, for that matter, Algeria isn't the only country in the world ...
I would have missed it -- but the phone rang and I let it play while I talked.  It looks like blank tape -- but it isn't.  It's been erased without any input signal coming in.
Here it is!  According to the old will Joanne Braslow was to inherit two hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
So she knew about his heart?
What about the will?
That's what my report will read.
What are you saying, Henry?  That his girlfriend fucked him to death?
What can we prove?
What induced it?
So, Mr. Marsh used cocaine?
What was the nature of the argument?
He was away on an extended vacation and just returned two days ago.
Suspicions maybe -- but suspicions aren't enough for a conviction.
Objection.  The question calls for a conclusion on the part of the witness.
Mr. Marsh's Cardiologist and his nurse have told us that you accompanied Mr. Marsh to their office on at least two occasions.
Do you know who Mr. Marsh was with?
You wouldn't know her address, would you?
Did you ever see Mr. Marsh use Cocaine?
Tell the court about that, please.
Did you talk about Miss Lawson?
She was here?
He did everything he could to take care of his heart?
Mr. Roston, what was your relationship with Miss Lawson?
How would you describe your sex life with Miss Lawson?
What kind of condition are you referring to?
Mr. Roston I know this is difficult for you, but it's important you tell the court what she did.
If you knew it was bad for you why did you do it?
What happened after that?
You'll be sorry?
I may have been infatuated with her - - but I wouldn't perjure myself.
--And is Miss Lawson a patient of yours?
Did you ever prescribe any medication for her cramps?
I worked for Mr. Marsh for six years. He was a good man -- until she came along.
Did Mr. Marsh use drugs?
I suppose.
No.
P.M.
I'm gonna go to jail.  I know they're gonna make it look like I did it. They gotta put it on someone.
Yes.
Have you ever seen animals make love, Mr. Dulaney?  They have such passion -- such savage emotion.  They struggle, and snarl, and claw, but neither hurts the other.  Not really.
As it pertains to you -- not me.  Did you always know you had different... tastes?
Why not?
-- And then?
Sorry.
Did you always want to be a lawyer?
That seems so far away from who you are now.  What happened?
Yes -- it would be nice.
Something wrong?
Rebecca -- we shattered a man's life in open court.
You killed him -- didn't you?
You can think whatever you want, Frank -- but I didn't kill Andrew, and I'm not going to prison for something I didn't do.
Hello?
She's right, Paley.  You've got to kill me.  She doesn't have to -- she's free -- she can't be tried again -- but you, you planned it with her.  You supplied the Coke.  You're an accessory to murder.
No -- he's lying.
I love you.
The witness will answer the question.
Your Honor -- the prosecution has introduced cocaine as one of the contributing reasons Mr. Marsh died. How it may have been introduced into the household is of vital importance.
You're on vacation, remember?  You're supposed to be relaxing.
This is not relaxing.
If he files are you going to take the case?
Why don't you talk to him now?
Sharon, it's late.  Can we get to the point?
Yes.
Frank -- stop it!  Stop it!
No, we just had lunch at the hotel with my brother and his new wife. She told me all the dirt. I forgot how interesting things can get around here. It was so good to see them. The last time we visited they were in Europe. He is doing so well. He ordered champagne. For lunch! I nearly died.
My Jewish friend's grandmother did.
Not to mention people driving over her and doggies doing their business --
It's a beautiful picture of her.
I do not need instructions from you to bathe!  I knew you'd do this! I knew I'd come all the way here and be shut out as usual! I came to be here for you! I didn't have to come!  Lord knows I was never much welcome in this house before. Apparently dead or alive, nothing's changed.
He dropped them off at Betty's mom. Where's Steve?
What's he saying now?
DAMN HIM! I knew mama wouldn't have thought of that herself. It was some damn perverted... photographic mind influencing her! When did the bastard die?
My Lord. It must feel real nice living inside your head with Peter Pan and the Easter Bunny.
Grateful!?
Oh, this heat! Times like this I wish we took that offer from your brother and moved on up to Michigan.
Not this kind of heat.
What do you know about "the changes"?
No, leave it. I'll do it later. Listen, maybe you and Floyd can come for dinner on Saturday. I'm sure Richard'll have so many stories to tell you both about the fair and all.
Oh. When did you move back?
No, really?
So, how long you've been living here?
This won't take long. I'm shooting tomorrow morning. I just need to do some prep work.
Oh, that's nice.
Well, thank you for all your help, Mrs. Johnson.
Mind if I smoke?
I better go. You sure you're all right?  It's been a pleasure. Sincerely.
Why, do you think?
I didn't mean that the way it sounded.
When?
Do you mind if I... ask you why you got divorced?
But -- how can you just live for what you want? What about other people?
But no one in particular.
No, I'm just saying --
Just because someone chooses to settle down and have a family doesn't necessarily mean they're hypnotized. Just because I've never seen a gazelle stampede doesn't mean I'm asleep in the world.
I thought that's what we were doing -- asking questions.
Oh.
Oh. I guess you got the whole story.
How about if I set the table?
You want to eat something?
Right now. Tell me someplace you've been -- someplace on the other side of the world. Anywhere but here.
Yes.
I don't know why I'm so tired all of a sudden.
Good. More coffee?  Robert, I hope you don't mind my asking, but I feel like I should.
Stop it!
What do you want me to say?
No matter how I keep turning it around in my mind -- it doesn't seem like the right thing.
His family's lived for almost a hundred years. Richard doesn't know how to live anywhere else. And the kids...
You've got to know deep down that the minute we leave here. It'll all change.
No. Don't do this.
What about your husband?
It's a Chicago station. I found it the other day.
"I had forgotten this. I had somehow remembered it being more his fault, his decision. Then I remembered we made love in that field before we left for home. And I remembered it was my idea. I remembered tearing his shirt and biting his body, hoping he would kidnap me. I had forgotten that too. And I wondered, as I sat there... how many other things I'd forgotten."
I'm positive.
Are you seeing Betty tonight?
Well, she's... she's real pretty and ... and she's got a cute shape... she's a good sport, ya know, for laughs and  ... she loves fried chicken wings and beer.
Oh my God...!
Your mother left explicit instructions that she wished to be cremated.
When did she decide this?
Hell no!
Take my advice.  And shoot that dog.  Or let me.
Is it true?
Oh yeah, I guess this would be that space that was so perfect for a recording studio.
...Bones ol' Bones so mean and bad, whupped his mamma, shot his dad.
Looks like a damn graveyard round here.
Tia ain't a chick.  She's family.  And don't forget it.
Shit.
Yeah, we can.  Least till after this weekend.  He ain't going nowhere.  We'll deal with it then.
You ain't going down there.  Not alone. I'll go.
We can climb out.
Yeah, we used to do the after-school b ball at Kenwood.  What it is?
What else?  Money.
Maybe I oughtta get there a little early. For good luck.
Where are we, baby?
Hey Jimmy, you know Eddie Mack, don't you?
What it will be.
We'll have to sneak in.
Guess it's not Rossmore Park.  Thanks for the help.
Why?
The dead get out?
I'm here.
Where is it?
I saw your face.  You knew that place. You knew those people.
Please...help me...
Maybe so.  Maybe so.  But that ain't why I came to see you.  You sold the building.
No way man...
Not your style.  Is it Eddie?  Killing off your customers?
Goddamnit!  How many times I told you --
You boys been hitting the pipe?
Yeah right, and which ever of us is still alive at the end of the week inherits all Vincent Price's cash.
Boy, put that thing down.  You can't take that.  Might be evidence.
Caesar?  What is this?
No, Gino!
Sit down, Gino!
Caesar, I'm serious.  This is too much.  I have to get out of here.
Caesar, what happened?
Just look at this mess I got to deal with.
Where the hell's the laundry detergent?
It couldn't have been.
It's impossible!
I need you ...
What do you think we're going to do? We have to find the money.
Once we have the money, then none of this ever happened.
Fuck!  Fuck!  Fuck!
Shut up, Violet.
I saved you.
Not on duty, sorry.
I'm going to ask you where the money is.  Every time you don't give me an answer, I'm going to cut off one finger.
No.  I don't know where they are.  I even called over at Johnnie's, but no answer.
Is that the money?
It's Gino!  It's Gino!
Un-fucking-believable.  I called those highway patrol dumb fucks.
We had a report of gunfire, so if you could --
Who?
Mmmm ...  thanks, I needed this.
Oh, I'm sorry --
Are they really?
Yeah.
'63 Chevy.
Oh no.  Shit.  I didn't know he would call you.  God, you must think |I'm a total nuisance.
Okay, one drink.
You seem uncomfortable.  Do I make you nervous, Corky?
You dropped that earring down the drain on purpose, didn't you?
No.
...  I needed that.
You didn't have to tell me if you didn't want to.
I'm glad you did.
I don't understand - ?
Oh no, she's nothing like you.  She's a lot smarter than you.
Caesar lives for these moments.  He tells me it's just the business, but I know it's more than that.  He likes it.  The violence.  I'll catch him in the bathroom mirror touching his scars.  He says they remind him who he his.  They're all like that. Except maybe Mickey.
You made a choice once.  Do you think you would make that same choice again?
All you would need to keep yourself clean would be someone unconnected, someone like me.
Then what?  Exactly.
What?
Yes.
Why?
What happened?
Why?
I'm sorry, Corky ...
Hey.
Oh my God.  Was anyone hurt?
Mickey!  Oh God, Mickey!
I know you will.
And what if I couldn't do that?
We've been down here for two weeks banging our heads against the wall. We've been <u>sleeping</u> down here.  We just got our first lead fourteen hours ago, and now? -- now that we <u>finally</u> have something to work with -- you want to bring planning personnel down here?  I'd rethink that.
That was two hours -- two hours to get a second opinion -- and nothing changes.  He's loose.  He's out of control.  It's very clear what needs to happen.  I have work to do.
Yes.
Treadstone.
What is Treadstone?
<u>What did you do to me</u>?
So now you know.
You're a U.S. Citizen?
Paris?
Yes, I'm...I'm looking for Mr. Jason Bourne.
There was an accident.  On the motorway.  Apparently, he was killed instantly.  Really, I'm terrible sorry to be the one to tell you this...
His brother.  You know his brother?
It's very bad this.  Terrible sad. Such a young man.
Let me get you a new copy of the proposal.
Okay.  Twenty thousand.  Ten now.  Ten there.
What if I say no?
Just so you know, if you're gonna burn me on the money, you might as well kill me.  I was supposed to have this car back three days ago.  It's not my car.
I don't know.  Smile.  Sneeze. Something.  You've got a bag full of money and a ride to Paris.  Fuck it, I don't know...  What kind of music do you like?
What are you talking about?
Sounds like you were in an accident or something.
Look, I don't know what's up there.
Look, you could come up.  Or you could wait if you want.  I could go check it out.  You could wait.
This is your office?  God, you live like a monk...
He went out the window -- why? -- why would someone do that?
I found it.  It took six calls.  I found Kane.  I found the body.
Shit, we didn't sign in.
-- this is serious business down here and we cannot have people coming and going --
Get in the basement.
-- Miss Kreutz, please --
Tell him we're busy.
-- but it was <u>him</u> --
-- what're you talking about? --
It came from your hip.  Under the skin.  You have a bank in Zurich.  You remember Zurich?
...ergency procedures.
... And then some.
... fix themselves.
This is what you get when you have cowboys round yer ducts.
Jill Layton ...  You're a very good little girl. What are you doing here?
In fact, killing people -
And the cost of it all, Deputy Minister? Seven percent of the gross national produce ...
But the bombing campaign is now in its thirteenth year ...
Thank you very much, Deputy Minister.
Sorry ...
Triplets.
{winking at Sam) She doesn't like me telling anyone but she's pleased as anything really.
Sorry about that ... Mr Helpmann told me you were coming aboard - congratulations!
OK. Come back this afternoon, about four o'clock. If you give me the number of the case, I'll have the dossier here waiting.  My tailor,... well worth the investment.
You clever bastard! I might have guessed. You only moved in today and you're already hot on the bloody trail.
Er ... but I would've found out anyway.
Trust me. You do trust me, don't you?
They weren't at school with us.
Say it was a mistake.
Well, I'd better get out there and try to get to her before security does. Let me borrow her dossier for a while.
Trust me.
She's innocent, Jack --- she's done nothing wrong.
You don't really think Tuttle and the girl are in league?
You think these are tits don't you?
What are you doing? For Christ's sake! Get moving!
Where are you taking me?
Turn around!
They'll be there waiting.
Turn!
I was right! Step on it!
What?
What happened to you after ...
Thanks for the vote of confidence.
Perhaps the machine's on the blink! It keeps picking up old films. That can't he right, can it?
Here. What do I do next?
Of course, of course. Leave it to me. How do I authorize a cheque?
Can I forget it?
Damn! Blast!
Alright. There's someone I want to check out. A woman called Gillian Layton.
You remember Samuel, my son.
Oh, to hell with the diet, a number eight, please.
I just wish you would stop interfering, mother! I don't want promotion. I'm happy where I am.
Actually, there's someone I want to meet ...
That's all right Ida ... it's just that he's such an artist. To him, cutting is so crude ... so primitive.
But I could be anybody.
A steak, please. Rare.  Mother, I need to ...
I'm sorry, but I'm a bit of a stickler for paper work. Where would we be if we didn't follow the correct procedures?
Ha!!
They're a bit overworked these days. Luckily I intercepted your call.
The pace?
Can you fix it?
Nobody tells me to fire anyone. I told them: shove it up the big one.  Sorry.  I said, you want to fire him, come over and do it yourself.
Is she dying?
You know each other a long time?
Frank, take it easy. what happened?
I'm always interested in people in stressful occupations and being a paramedic is about as stressful as I can imagine. Here, sit down. What's it like? Tell me some war stories.
That shit is poison, Frank. We don't drink alcohol here. What you need is one of these.
I guess I'll be going.
So, Frank, am I going to live?
You're going to three-four Avenue C, 17 year-old female cardiac arrest, no further information.
Let's do it!  It's Marcus, Love, only for you.
No. He's dead.
See, I can't do it. I came out of the desert.
It's crazy in there. What's wrong with that doctor? He keeps mumbling, poking himself in the eye when he talks to me.
I know. It's awful, isn't it? Night of the Living Cheerleaders.
Sleeping.
Be tough to get a taxi here. We can give you a ride if you like.
He's better.
Yeah, or Saint Anthony. You from the neighborhood?
On yeah? I went to Holy Name. Where'd you go to high school?
Like everybody else--except us. Always standing on the sidewalk waving goodbye to moving trucks. Your parents ... ?
You married?
It's been bad lately, but it's always bad.
Five years.
I think I'd remember that.
Mostly. It must be my face. My mother always said I looked like a priest.
Excuse me. You seemed like you were in trouble.
Mary. Mary, we've got to get going.
You and CY have a nice talk? He tell you about Sunrise Enterprises, helping people? Well, I've seen him hurt people. Why are you following me?
What is it? You want to help me, you feel sorry for me? Keep it to yourself.
Too bad. He called me up today, can you believe that? I don't know how he got my number. He asks me do I want to come over and see him, I tell him I'd rather go to a leper colony. He says there's a new gang that wants to kill him, take over the business. I told him I hope he's right. That they kill him. That's what I told him.
No, we just ate. I only remember how tough my father was. Now I know he had to be like that, to make us tough. This city'll kill you if you aren't strong enough.
We're all whores, Frank. You know what I'm talking about, the way she looked at me.
No, you didn't, Frank, thank you. But there's still a couple hours left on the shift.
You know what I'm talking about. It's all over your face. That I-just- saved-a-little-baby-boy look.
The family know?
No.
I'm sorry.
Great to be drunk. Sobriety's killing me.
Get this, Frank--we got two patients. Number one, the scarecrow outside. Number two misses the railing but breaks both legs on the balcony, then throws himself through a glass window, heads to the bedroom, where he's now passed out.
Get ready, Frank. Missed a drug shooting while you were dicking around in there. There's gonna be trauma tonight!
C'mon, Tom, pick up a job.
This guy's been terrorizing the neighborhood for weeks, ever since he got outta jail, wreaking general havoc, contributing to the bad name of the place. The term "menace to society" was made up for him.
Look at that. Tell me that's a crazy person. Every move is calculated. He knows exactly what he's doing. This is the guy. I've been after him for weeks. He's quick, runs like a rat, tough for one person, but with two of us--
Get the kit! We're gonna tube him!
We're gonna save you, Noel. You're gonna be all right.  Do it, Tom! I'll call for fucking backup, I swear!
Mr. Oh.
Relax, it's a street job, easy except for the smell. We'll just throw him in back and zip over to Mercy--no blood, no dying, that's how I look at it. He's just a drunk.
Well why didn't you say so?
Stomach again.
Answer the radio Zebra. You know it's that time.
Shit, shit, shit...
What did I do to you?
You can't talk about feeling intimidated when you're on top of the world.  It's unseemly.
You were smokin' toward the end there.
Everybody has one like that.  I thought it was great when you started to laugh at the end.
I'm just bringing him over to give Jane a look at him --
Okay.
That's your full name?
Which would you prefer?
Nine seconds.
Last time Paul was sick they gave Connie the weekend news instead of me.
Sounds like you may be on to something.
Jesus, Jane.  How long have you been here?
Tom...why don't I meet you there? I've got some last minute stuff I've got to take care of...Hey, how did you resolve your dilemma -- did you rent the tux or buy it...I knew it. How much?  Wow...Okay...See you there...
<u>If</u>...if not, I'll have the tape...I'll wait for you at my apartment.
Do others feel that you did well?
Stop kidding.  I want to know what happened.
If all that happened, how come you're so chipper?
I don't know.  I may be in love with him.
Don't go.
You were quick enough to get Tom's help when...
I think so...They've been talking to me about being Tom's Managing Editor.
I like it!  So, doll, what about you lately?
Oh, you mean use him...That's nice.  Okay.
We know each other well enough for me to care how I put something to you which could wipe you out. So I will phrase things the way I think they should be phrased.  All right?
Do it then.
We came from Washington.
Okay.  I just wanted you to know.
I was a little nervous there for a minute.
You think anyone who's proud of the work we do is an ass kisser.
This is a brutal layoff...And all because they couldn't program Wednesdays.
No, I don't.  He happens to deserve the credit.  He's right here.
Yeah, I know, I went back and forth on it.
Tell George and Jessica to try and cover everything without Tom having to ask additional questions.
Did you hear what I just said -- do you have that?  Take a breath.
Go back to 316, Bobbie.  The sound bite in the cab -- it starts, 'I don't know how I'll feel...'
Play back the last line...
I've been doing some morning show stuff, but mostly radio -- that doesn't bother me.  I'm in no rush for anything.  It's just the snotty attitude, even if I have it coming, it's still...
What?
Yes.  How do you know?
What if we just don't tell them anything anymore unless they let you do the story?
I broke up with my roommate -- He was really the magnet for everyone who knew anything.
...good-bye then.
What?
...am starting to get jealous. I read in the newspapers about the Italian strike and riots in Milan.  I hope you weren't...
You don't have to finish tonight.
Why so glum?
Were you bothering by those waitresses making a fuss?
Thanks, Dad, this talk helped.  Will you sign it, please?
It must be nice to always believe you know better.  To think you're always the smartest person in the room.
I had no idea she was this good.
Thank you.  They hated me.  I don't hate them.
If we could just eat first.
Come on...Even I'm not that hard on myself.
Except I'm no good at what I'm being a success at.
Listen to me.  You keep on thinking I'm somebody ho lacks...confidence. That's not it.  I know I can talk well enough and I'm not bad at making contact with people, but I don't like the feeling that I'm pretending to be a reporter.  And half the time I don't really get the news I'm talking about.  It isn't that I'm down on myself.  Trust me, I stink.
I'm sorry if I was in the way.  It was totally impressive.  Great piece.
Can I buy you dinner sometime soon?
Nervous?
We're going to George.  Say 'the Joint Chiefs are meeting -- we have George Weln at the Pentagon'.
Jane?
I just read about it in a magazine and it affected me.
I'm not sure I dialed right -- Jane?
Suppose I go in for a little while and you wait in the lobby-bar.  How's that?
Why can't I let go of this woman?
Hi.  It's me.
Jane, I'm not some chore you have to finish so you can stay on schedule.
I felt funny about it afterwards.  It's verboten, huh?  I thought since I did it for real the first time -- but I get you.  That's not the reason you're not coming?
We disagree on how God-awful it was.  Why don't you come with me and we can disagree and get a tan at the same time?
This is a one-way argument.  We've got six days; if you go and we fight and we hate it -- we'll come home.  If you don't go?  Well, that's a much bigger deal.  I go to London right after that. So, it'd be very big deal if you stay here.  The plane's boarding.  You're good at deadline.  Here's your ticket.
It's just that one of the few things I'm not confused about is what I was saying downstairs, that...
Well, why not?  Hey, what is this?  My life's rushing in front of my eyes.
Ummm -- it's dumb dorm stuff but I see Tom around you a lot and this is such a small office and I'd like to see him outside of work, unless there's some reason for you to mind... in which case I just won't do anything.
I sure know that feeling.  Terrific work today.
Don't be silly.  What are you sorry about?
Listen schmuck, why don't you get out of here and let me go to bed!
Well I'm touched.  You're serious, aren't you?
Tonight.
It's kind of dark -
That doesn't look like very much clay.
A girl with a body like mine?
Yeah, he's keeping an eye out, said he'd call us if he sees anything. That's about it for tonight.
See you later -
How did you ever find it all in yourself, Walter?
Gee..twenty five dollars for something I made!
More champagne, your majesty?
I mean, you look so pretty.
Nice night out...
Uh...  ...how long have you been thinking about this, Walter?
Now calm down Walter!  Now, let's go in there, and when the show's over, maybe we can talk about it.
Walter...there's...
Walter...stay away from me!
Ah, your new head shot...  I like it, very much...
What's the matter with you?
Well then admit it, it's a work of genius.
No.  Why don't you cover it up Walter...
It will take years to make that many statues.  But your work would be featured.
Yeah, can you say plagiarism?
I mean it's like, you know, I do my art because that's what I am, you know?  I'm an artist.  I'm not like a banker, you know.  Like I create.
There's that weird dude again.
Man if you want to be a legit artist you have to do nudes, nudes, nudes...
Man, why do you suppose Walter wants to get her alone?  You suppose he could be physically attracted to her?
You want to buy it, put it in the club?
Well...why did you put a knife in it?
Alright, I'll tell you what.  I'll put it in the corner of the alcove. If it sells, we'll split it fifty- fifty.  How's that?
All that is comes through the eye of the artist...
Look, go home and...work on something. Make another cat.
You know what that proves?
The question is what are you going to make next, Walter?  Did you make that dog yet, or that parakeet?  How about making something out of the cockroaches in your room?
Well...why murdered man?
You might talk too much.
Hello Leonard!  Beautiful morning, isn't it?
Whatsamatter Leonard?
Listen to me, listen to me...I've been collecting art pieces all over the world for years and let me tell you something.  This newcomer Walter Paisley has it, whatever it is, the X factor, that indefinable quality that separates the greats from the hacks, and I want that cat in my hands.  Are you listening to me?
You like chasing the dragon, Walter?
Police officer.
I'm not looking to pinch you!  I don't care about you, or the girl.  But you want to save your ass, you better start telling me what I want to hear.  Now!
Wait a minute!  What'd I do?
I didn't do nothing wrong!  That was Mayolia's!  I didn't ask her for it.  I don't know about any -
And what project looms on the horizon, Walter?
I get it Walter.  I get it.
Hello Mayolia.
Oh, hello Mrs. Swicker.
Straightening up indeed!  Are you sure you're not alone?
Uh, Mrs. Swicker I got to meet some friends later, and I have to take a shower!
I like it.  Can I be your friend?
Buffy, this is crazy.  What do these guys want?
Hey!  She wasted my dog!
I got a news flash, man, another shot of this and I'll have sex with you.
Let me in, Pike!  I'm hungry!
I'm hungry.
Wheels?
Are there any good sicknesses that aren't too depressing?
Dying.
Do you know what time it is?
Have you gained a few pounds?  Maybe it's that outfit...
Something like that.
What show is this?
Oh.  Who's in it?  I know what it is.  It's what's on instead of the movie.
Come on, what was it?
I can't get sick.  You know -- training and all.  I'm gonna be late.
You're even weaker than the others.
I am a God!  A God!
You had a car full of stuff.  Were you leaving?
I'm kinda beat.  You can stay in my mom's room if you want.
Hey, Buffy...
Pike, I don't think you're up to this.
I been working on some stuff for you.  What'cha doing?
Are you okay?
I didn't say it was a bad idea, I just said the timing was off.  We could maybe wait till later.
It is a pretty crucial subject.
Can't.  History report.  The Normans and the Saxons.
Like what?
What did Jeffrey's dad say?
Listen to you.  What language are you speaking?
God, where the hell did you come from?  You scared me to death.
What?  Oh.  I used to do gymnastics. Are you looking for someone?
Am I in trouble or something?
Why?
Time to do what?
How do you know all this?
It's not pretty, but it does suit our purposes.
What?
Great.  First I have a birthright, now I've got a fate.  Hey, do I have to take notes on this?
Well... I do cheerleading now. It's way cooler.
It was necessary.
Put your head back.
What about bats?  Do they turn into bats?
All right.  You've heard of the emperor Caligula, perhaps?  Or Jack the Ripper?
What!?!
You are such a wet.
And why are you always wearing black? It's so down.  It's totally not your color.  I don't think you have a color.
We call them zippers.  They're not supposed to be a challenge.
Interesting.
There isn't time.
Sooner or later you're going to have to accept it.  Your fate.
None of the other girls ever gave me this much trouble.
Mr. Howard is so heinous.  He's always giving me a hard time.  I get a C-plus on the test and he tells me, 'You have no sense of history.'  I have no sense of history?  He wears a brown tie.
You guys blow.  I'm waiting on Cassandra.  She's gonna help me with my history.
Don't worry, Jennifer.  Someday your prince will come.
Pike.
I find it restorative, sleeping in the life-blood of so many.  To feel their souls coursing about me.
No, wait.  I can be dumb.  Really. Or mean, or whatever.  I can learn. I'm useful.
I can't!
Why?  Why me?
Buffy?
She didn't even hardly talk to anyone in school.  All year.  She didn't even go to the prom.
You're kidding.
The don't.  You kind of wish they would, though.
I'm sorry.  I'm Pike.  This is Benny.
Oh, God.
It's amazing what you can do with a parachute and some starch.
What nasty bug crawled up your bungus and where the hell are you going?
You mean Nuke.  You said "Crash".
You said "Crash".
You've been pitching out of the wrong side of your brain.  These'll help move things to the right side.
You're patronizing me!  I will not be patronized--
God...I think I'm gonna be sick--
I'm yours.
I'm so proud of you and all the guys.  Want some more soup?
Crash once called a woman's, uh-- pussy--y'know how the hair kinda makes a "V" shape?--
I knew it--you're seducing me!
I'm starting to understand what you're teaching me.  I mean the panties and the nostrils and all that shit...I mean I'm getting it--
Aw hell, let's have a quickie right here--
Neither will I.
You should be at the game.
I'm Crash Davis.
I don't dance.
These are the ground rules.  I hook up with one guy a season-- I mean it takes me a couple of weeks to pick the guy--kinda my own spring training...  And, well, you two are the most promising prospects of the season so far.  So...  I thought we should get to know each other.
Wait, Crash--don't go--all I want is a date.  I'm not gonna fall in love with you or nothin'.
Damn.
Damn.
I doubt that.
God damn you--what is happening? Is there no man who'll have me?  This is the weirdest season I ever saw--the Durham Bulls can't lose and I can't get laid!
I got a lotta time to hear your theories and I wanta hear every damn one of 'em...but right now I'm tired and I don't wanta think about baseball and I don't wanta think about Quantum Physics...  I don't wanta think about nothing...  I just wanta be.
Number twenty-two's thighs are just great.  Who's he?
Oh dear....easy honey...
Hum, babe, hum, babe, fire it in here, hum babe--
Oh no--he's shaking off the sign, Jackson.  Big mistake...
He's a good student.
Will that work for me?
No, that is not belief.  That is desperation.
Don't bump me.
Did you call me a cocksucker?
You missed the tag!
Try it!  Go ahead.  Call me a cocksucker!
Call me a cocksucker and you're outta here!
"To announce your fucking presence with authority"?  This guy's a first ball fastball hitter.  He's looking for heat.
What do I got?
You're weird, man--I want a ice skater real bad.
What would you think of a pitcher who wore women's panties?
You told him I was throwing a deuce, right?
I love winning, Crash, you hear me?  I love It.  Teach me everything.
Of course.  That's the point.  "I'm just happy to be here and hope I can help the ballclub."
Club's expanding its roster to finish the season--
I'm trying to thank you.
C'mon, we got nothin' to fight about.
Why am I a fuck?
It's the best, Nuke...the absolute fucking best.
Crash Davis?
I don't know.  I haven't caught anything yet.
Yeah, Skip, you wanted to see me?
I don't believe in fighting.
Take the first shot at me.
No.  If I screw up, I wanta do it alone.  I'll call.
Where's Ebby?
But he ain't quite sure which plane he's on, y'know what I mean...
Jesus--what's got into Nuke?
I was never - I was never your guest at the Tangiers.
That's right.
First of all, what they did was totally unconstitutional. We're already on the list to be heard before the Supreme Court of the United States later this year.
...stupid things.
Oh, good.
But one thing I could never understand, was that she could have everything under control, except for her old pimp boyfriend, Lester Diamond.
I'll call you right back.
Now this is just a signature card.
No, tha-that's good. It's just unusual. To tell you the truth, so many of my clients don't.
Hello? Hello! Ginger.
What's that? You hear? You hear a little girl, Frankie? You hear a little girl, Ace? Is that a little fuckin' girl?!  What happened to the fuckin' tough guy?  Told my friend stick it up his fuckin' ass?! Huh?! Huh?!
While I was tryin' to figure out why the guy was sayin' what he was sayin', Nicky just hit him. No matter how big a guy might be, Nicky would take him on. You beat Nicky with fists, he comes back with a bat. You beat him with a knife, he comes back with a gun. And you beat him with a gun, you better kill him, because he'll keep comin' back and back until one of you is dead.
But nobody had to take care of Nicky.
Yeah.
Holy shit, what've you been doin' out here?
Especially at the casino, where he definitely did not work, people got the message.
When I married Ginger I knew all the stories, but I didn't give a fuck. 'I'm Sam Rothstein,' I said. 'I can change her.'
He insulted Billy. And then I walked over to him politely...
So what do you think I do? I threw that cocksucker out.
It just didn't sink into his head about the Black Book and what it meant. Not being able to go into a casino is just one thing, but being in this book etched your name into the brains of every cop and FBI agent in the state. I mean, you're listed in there with Al Capone. But Nicky didn't care.
...very difficult to get in.
You think he got the point?
You should say so.
All right, fine.
That's all taken out of context. Okay.
What happened to me? What happened to you?
Yes, you lost your control.
All right.
My wife?
All of a sudden, you're the shoulder to cry on? Did you at least tell her about your little role in that whole situation?
Listen, I would -
Okay?
This guy is gonna run to the FBI.
Peekaboo, you fucks, you.
Yeah.
Where the fuck you get off talkin' to people about me behind my back? Goin' over my head?
What people! What'd you think, I wasn't gonna find out?
Your fuckin' ass! You could have had the food and beverage job without goin' on television!  You wanted to go on TV.
You're makin' a big fuckin' spectacle of yourself.
Nicky, Nicky, you're not listenin' to me. I'm here to help you. What's the matter with you?  You're gonna bury us both.
How'd you know I was here?
Oh, yes. Will you help me fold these, please?
Because Nicky enjoyed being a gangster, and he didn't give a damn who knew it.
You know, I don't feel like playin' tennis.
Well, sir, I was just...
...trying to offer you the respect that your...
...position...
I hired an old casino pal, Billy Sherbert, as my manager and I went to work.
Now, he's really pissed.
He wants a fifty-thousand marker.
Any change?
She took care of the dealers...
The Ginger I knew wouldn't even look at this creep.
Within no time, everything was set in place. We got rid of the freelance scamsters. The per was way up.  The gods were happy, or as happy as the gods can ever be.  And I, I decided to complicate my life. For a guy who likes sure things, I was about to bet the rest of my life on a real longshot.
You know a lot of happily married people, Sam? 'Cause I don't.
Understand?  I'm sorry.
Oh, it's so soft.
You're askin' me for twenty-five thousand. I'm not out to make you feel bad. I want to just be able to trust you. You now, it's about trust. I have to be able to trust you with my life. Do you understand? Can I trust you?  Can I trust you?... Can I trust you?... Answer me. Can I trust you?
You can't make me stop caring...
Listen.  Ginger. I'm tryin' to make the best of everything here, you know?  I mean, you're my wife, for chrissakes. Uh, I mean... people look up to you in this town. I don't know what to think -
How could you say that?  You're a beautiful woman. You're destroying yourself. You don't need that stuff. You don't need that fuckin' leech livin' off you. I know you better than you know yourself. You're a tiger, you're stronger than I am. And when you set your mind on doing something, you do it better than anybody.  You can do it.  You can do it.
I mean she's only sober about two hours a day. It's usually from eleven in the morning until one in the afternoon. And if I gave her her money and her jewels now, you know what she's gonna do? She's gonna piss it all away in about a year, and then where will she be?  Where would you be then? Comin' right back to me, right back to me.  Or finding some other excuse to come and I - I -
...the rest of the two million is still there?
So, what'd ya do with it?
With the money.
The good part was, I had Amy back. So, we went home, had the housekeeper stay over, put the kid to bed, I calmed myself down and we went to dinner. I tried to keep things nice and civil, you know.  But... hey, twenty-five thousand for three suits? That doesn't make much sense.
Take your  fuckin' bag and get out of here!
Yeah, no kidding. Good! It opens at 9 a.m. Be there!
You threw it away?
With Jennifer.
Why do you want to do that?
Fine.  Just gonna get the bowl for my thing.
I was with somebody.
...she did what she did and I did what I had to do. But, Jesus, Nicky was the worst thing she could've done.
Oh...
She wasn't gonna get up. I was just gonna be out for a little while.
Oh, sh-
I w- I was gonna be back before she woke up.
Why don't you just let me go, Sam?
I just want the key to my jewelry, and I want you to let me go.
...'Ace' Rothstein, accused the state's top gaming officials of corruption.
Yeah, okay.
Yes, there is. An infallible way! They won!
Now, you're gonna have to learn with your left hand.
Excuse me.
You know where she gets this from!
What expenses?
Yeah, least you could do is return my phone calls, though.
Hey, you fat Irish prick. You put my fuckin' money to sleep. You go get my money, or I'll put your fuckin' brain to sleep.
I'm just trying to get in my house!
Can I go in?
It looked like a fuckin' gun!
Sir, you're gonna have to leave. You mind accompanying us outside?
Leave me alone!
Is that what you did?
You took your boots off? You put your feet on the table... you shit- kicking, stinky, horse-manure-smellin' motherfucker you!  You fuck me up over there, I'll stick you in a hole in the fuckin' desert! You understand?  Go over there and apologize.  Go! Get the fuck out of -
Now, I want you to get out there and get me singles and doubles, okay? 'Cause that's what's gonna win this game.
Oh.
I think, you know, maybe he went across the street or somewhere else or somethin'. I don't know.
Artie! Artie!
We're placing you under arrest for aiding and abetting -
Yeah. Everybody's talkin' about it. They're makin' a big deal out of it.
Yeah, I know. That's why I'm asking. You see, my main concern is Nicky.
I want to know... if he's doin' all right. If he's okay.
But back then the bosses didn't give a fuck about whether he enjoyed himself of not. To them, he was a cash register. All they had to do was ring the bell and take the money. Especially Remo, who was a fuckin' degenerate gambler who always lost.
T'aggia parla. [Italian-American slang for 'I've got to talk to you'] Nicky... See that guy? 
Hi, Jennifer.
I can see that. Sure.
No. I - I'm just curious, you know. I was wonderin' how much he would put into a thing like that. That's all.
Okay.
Tell me what you were gonna say. Go ahead.
Yeah.
See who I got in there. Gotta get somebody I can trust.
You know?
Nicky, please...
What did I tell you? Supposing he goes back home and makes a fuckin' beef?  I gotta know exactly what you said. Tell me what you said to him.
Yes!
Come on.
I'm always here for you.
Don't make me come there. Answer me.
Do you know that?
Every time I ever see you, that's what I see.
Don't give me any of your shit!  Okay, this has always been a dream, but we're going.
I just talked to him.
Just knock it off! Would you two knock it off? Get in the car.
...they're in Penthouse K.
Wow.
Yeah.
Well, how come I laid nine?
Sometimes I used to go along on a heist just for the fun of it. But I didn't like the people I was rippin' off lookin' at me, so I used to turn their fuckin' pictures around.
Whenever we got local merch, we'd usually send it to Palm Spring or Arizona... LA. I had a couple of sand niggers out there. You know, Arabs.
Give all the guys in your crew a piece of that?
You walk past me?
...bosses. I mean, they're smokin' their Di Nobilis and they're eatin' a trippa [Italian-American slang for 'tripe'.] and fuckin' suffritt', you know, fried pigs guts? While, if I wanna talk private, I gotta go to a fuckin' bus stop.
Yeah, but they're complaining.
He asked me again about you and the Jew's wife.
Nah. You would've heard somethin'.
Listen to me, Anthony. I got your head in a fuckin' vise. I'm gonna squash your fuckin' head like a grapefruit if you don't give me a name. Don't make me have to do this, please. Come on. Don't make me be a bad guy. Come on.
Oh, God! Give me the fuckin' name!
Charlie M? You make me pop your fuckin' eye out of your head to protect that piece of shit? Charlie M? You dumb motherfucker!
How you doin'?
All right, yeah. You got that thing for me?
Pardon me, counselor. Before you continue...
That's enough.
...everything's comin' out of my pocket. I gotta pay for all these trips back and forth, back and forth.
...done right, you gotta do it yourself.
Have we reached the epi-center?
I thought we were going to take it easy until the Mission...
He likes you. Kincaid and I have always had similar tastes...
Oh, it's superb--I mean if you like that fascist nightmare kind of thing...
Selina, did you make it home, all right?  I tried calling, but your mother said that there was "no extension in the Hut." Whatever that means..
Women, huh?
Don't you feel so much better now that you know everything?  Blink once for yes, twice for..
What do you want from me?
Will you please stop fighting?  Just let those people die so we can get on with our new lives together!  Trust me, one day we'll look back on this day and laugh. You got to admit, it's a lot more fun to be the villain.
The shopkeeper on 13th street won't drop the lawsuit--He still claims one of the lasers we fired at the Jenkins gang burned down his store..
"Dat's gotta hurt!"
What a "drag."
Boss-man, what were you going on about last night: "I am the Law and I am the Danish..."
Right time. That was kind of fun. She had spunk.
I don't know, Boss, you saw what the big guy did to the last kitty we gave him.
Sorry man, I didn't mean that personally...
Quite a little performance you gave in the casino today--for me and that other guy. Come on down, let's chat..
You like them, don't you, Boss.
Why are you--I fought for you with honor.  Why should it matter if I'm a man or a woman, as long as I'm a good warrior.
A superhero's job is to protect society.  Don't blame me if society is a horrible, corrupt joke.
Yes. I am the reporter or the architect.  You've been through so much..It looks like you've used up all nine of your lives...
Ah, the good guys always triumph in the end. It's what allows our children to sleep at night.
Hey, you're anti-male.
Yeah, she's okay.
Sorry, I get carried away. Once I become interested in someone, I can't stop trying to figure them out...Amnesia victims are challenging..
I was wondering, if you're not doing anything tonight...
Nothing. How's your hand?
You know, now that I hear myself tell it, I'm thinking maybe both of you are messing with me. What, you get the Helmet Monday through Thursday, then Brock takes it for the weekend...
A hearty breakfast is the start of a great morning...
Mom?  Oh Mom, I messed up...
What's it like being a superhero?  It must be frightfully exciting..How did you guys all get together?
You seem sad, Spooky.
Was someone in an accident?
He ran out on me to be with you? Well fuck him!  Everything worked twice as good without him.  We didn't need him then and I don't need him now.
Who's on the phone?
What was that for?
I'm trying to help somebody. Okay?
He's right, Theo.  She might not be around to back up your story. You could end up in the middle of this.
I know you feel awful but it's not your responsibility.
It was the fugitive in the Chrysler that caused this.  We were trying to overtake him.
Now that'd be a misdemeanor.
Let's have your license, mister.
Nels reporting in.  Sit down where you are.  Arms folded.
Which is why we had a lot more to worry about than the law.  These are people who don't worry about reading you your rights.
I told you I should've cuffed him.
It took you long enough to get my ass out.
That's your "rep."
If you know that just back off.
That's illegal.  You want us pulled over?  I'll turn around at the corner if you'll shut the fuck up.
Let's hope so.  Once you come out and okay everything I'll give Caitlin the sign that she can bring the painting on over.
In any event, whatever occurs you do not belt anybody.
Okay, okay, Lenore, calm down. Either let me call the school or better yet, the F.B.I.
Nels, don't let that cop pass you.
Do I know you?
No.  <u>You</u> don't understand!  You caught me on my cellular on the way to pick up some business associates.  And I've got no time to screw around.
Who smashed the phone?
Don't expect me to tell you who I am.
Oh won't I?
Why would anybody want to hurt you?
Please.
I'm fine.  She's back on.  Hello?  I'm here.
The bigger man is driving our Mercedes to the school.  Rachel will recognize the car.  She'll get right in.
He's right.  You'll get my whole family killed.
26th off Wilshire.
Why isn't anyone answering me?
Hello?  It's just me and you again.
Hey drop it, okay?
Our house always needs touching up.
Make a right.  You can't miss it.
Does she have a red ribbon on that ponytail?
What's happening?
Wait just a minute.  Our luck has changed.
I'm pretty good at signatures myself.
Why tell me this?
Did you hear that click?
Yes?  Yes?
Thank you.  God bless you for helping us.
She's awake but she hasn't spoken. I don't know what they did to her. I don't want to think about it.
It's locked.
For Christ sakes don't point it at me.  We want to get Rachel out of there in one piece.  I'm waiting for the girl.  Her mother wants to talk to her.
He had a gun.  I have it now.
You're not Lenore Oberfeld.
At least one.
Tell them I'm keeping what's left. I earned it.  I probably killed some poor bastard for it.
Granted, the cops are not an alternative.  Certainly not with one of their own still locked in my trunk.
Only in the leg or the thigh. You'd live but you just wouldn't wear shorts.
Yes I would.  Not kill you.  But blow off a few toes, absolutely. I'm entitled to that as retribution.  It'll help you to remember me in years to come -- every time you put on stockings. They must have prosthetic toes by now -- with little nails on them you can polish --
They'll have units blocking us up ahead.
Wonderful feeling of security knowing your adversaries are both crippled and unarmed.
Think you could do a picture of me?
Who'd ever think, to look at you?
That's a reasonable possibility.
What's your point?
Which one of us is elected to do the deed?
Maybe your friends already accomplished that chore for us.
I picked the wrong number when I chose you ... didn't I?
You're walking away with a clear fifty percent and a guarantee nobody can afford to I.D. you.
I don't need to relax.  The woman. Put her on.
It's in the process.
You should've done all this before.
Her husband said there'd be one million eight.  So nine hundred to you.
Count it.
What's he doing?  Answer me!
You're going to have to see to it that both lanes of this road get blocked.
Tailgate me.  I'll jam on the brakes.  You go into a spin to avoid an accident and cut them off.
Yeah?
What does it take to kill you?
Why would she want me to think you were on ice?
Not without the name of the contact who can discount the bonds.  I may need to pry that information out of her.  What do you stand to gain?
I'm in awe.
Can I make a quick call?
What kind of Treasury Dept. business is this?
Let's have your name and address. The government will want to send you a letter of commendation.
Scottish?
He's what she should run a mile from.
When a girl runs out like that, she generally wants to be followed.
He gave me a look.
Don't want any of those looks, Col. They don't mean much.
See, they get the wrong idea.
Cunt. Scrag-eyed dyke cunt.
Don't chuck my clothes out!
Is that his tart? Does Pat have a tart?
Do it on your own time, Paddy.
If I was her I'd consider that an insult.
Sorry won't bring the bloody thing back, will it, Mr. Franknum?
Someone recommend you?
Who?
You American?
Tell her I'm very happy with it.
Jimmy.
You old-fashioned?
What was that all about?
You on the game?
You want me to ask you in, right?
Now, if you asked me to meet you tomorrow, it would really drive him insane.
Give me that look again.
That Dave?
What'll it be?
No.
Maybe.
So what do you want with me, Jimmy?
What does that mean?
Drink.
Even now.
Sorry, darling.
Made me feel all funny inside.
Will you meet me again?
Come on.
Come on.
Dil, this is Jude.
She's the thing you had to tell me.
Do you like me even a little bit?
You'd do anything for me?
So it's true, then?
Don't call me that --
Come on...
You got to forget you ever saw me, Dil.
Yes.
You killed my Jody?
You tried.
Wondered why you came on to me like that when you gave me the look.
Why?
Give me a bit more, baby, a bit more.
Then say it.
Say it again.
Got you the multivitamins and the iron tablets, hon --
Sorry, love. Now, the white ones are magnesium supplement --
I'm sorry, darling. I keep forgetting the leap year. What am I supposed to call you then, Jimmy?
Fergus. Fergus my love, light of my life - -
That's good. I'm glad. Young love, as they say.
A bit heavy on the powder, isn't she, Jimmy?
Poke him or something. See if he's still alive.
You don't know that.
But you know what the thing is, Fergus?
You vanished quite effectively. Became Mister Nobody. And you've no idea how useful that could be.
And then you'll leave her out of it?
You were made for this.
Dil!
Why would you do that?
You OK about that?
I thought it was Dave.
He's at home.
And what's she like between the sheets?
And who is she?
This is a farce, man.
Thank you, handsome.
No?
But I won't. We're more polite around these parts.
They won't let him die.
Shut the fuck up, would you?
No?
"Go back to your banana tree, nigger." No use telling them I came from Tottenham.
Well, in Antigua cricket's the black man's game. The kids play it from the age of two. My daddy had me throwing googlies from the age of five. Then we moved to Tottenham and it was something different.
Nice to meet you, Fergus.
Take it easy, now. Just go slow. Down by that tree.
Can't.
So what's that supposed to mean?
We don't look on it like that.
I didn't.
She can't help it.
Don't know her.
Take the whole lot. I won't need it.
What?
Nothing.
I'm glad you're doing it, do you know that, Fergus?
Used to run the mile, you know -- four times round the cricket pitch -- what was that game called?
And you know what?
I never know nothing.
Have you no feelings, woman?
Give me the shooter, Jude --
You know what I mean -- the envelope with the stamps. I want it.
I could eat a horse.
Don't you dare to be civil with me! All this time you were leading me on --
Oh!
What's the matter?
That wraps it up -- Tex has the money. Go back to bed -- I'll let you know when I've found him.
If the police find him first they're not very likely to turn over a quarter of a million dollars to us, are they?
I think we were wrong about Tex having the money.
Heroin -- peppermint-flavored heroin.
But Charles' appointment was last week, not --
Well, you're right there. Ten minutes ago I had a job.
Tex? You mean he's here, too?
Reggie -- why won't you listen?
You didn't have to chase me so hard --
Voss -- Charles Voss. All right, Mrs. Voss --  -- I'd like you to look at this photograph, please -- by the way, you saw this one, didn't you?  Scott, Cathy, and Ham, Jr.
Mrs. Lampert, I'm afraid you're in a great deal of danger.
Oh, you've got the money all right -- you just don't know you've got it.
Nevertheless, Mrs Lampert -- you've got it.
Why not?
Where are you now -- can you meet me? Do you know Les Halles?
He's hardly my Mr. Dyle.
Steal it how?
I don't know -- but I think you'd better find out, don't you?
Go ahead, Mr. Bartholomew -- I'm listening.
Calm down, Mrs. Lampert -- please. Does he have the money?
He looks so young -- when was this taken?
It's the man who came to the funeral yesterday -- I'm sure of it -- a tall man in a corduroy suit and string tie.
Well, of all the mean, rotten, contemptible, crooked --
You couldn't even be honest about being dishonest. Why didn't you say something?
Here --  Wait a minute -- how did Carson Dyle get an office in here, anyway?
Around one.
You did too say it -- I heard you. Oh, I love you Adam -- I mean Alex -- er, Peter -- Brian. I hope we have lots of boys -- we can name them all after you.
Back where?
Not my room!
We'd better exchange keys. Here's mine.
Carson Dyle is dead.
Didn't anyone ever tell you it's impolite to --  What happened?
Does it hurt?
I thought that was Peter Joshua.
You can't.
Because he's wearing moccasins.
Why can't you be serious?
Said what?
What are you doing?
Now please, Reggie -- cut it out.
He's all yours. I'll do Tex and Gideon. Take Jean-Louis with you -- and make sure you bolt the door from inside.
Or Tex?
I think Tex did it.
I'd love some, thanks.
I usually sing a medley of old favorites when I bathe -- any requests?
Every day. The manufacturer recommends it.
Nothing's going to happen to you while I'm around -- I want you to believe that.
After I graduated college I was all set to go into my father business. Umbrella frames -- that's what he made. It was a sensible business, I suppose, but I didn't have the sense to be interested in anything sensible.
Monsieur Flix -- ?
Have you ever, in your entire life, seen anything so beautiful?
I suggest you get about your business -- nothing soothes Herman like success.
You don't s'pose one o' us has it, like the man said -- I mean, that'd be pretty distasteful -- us bein' vet'rans o' the same war 'n' all.
It doesn't belong to you, Mrs. Lampert -- you do know that, don't you?
Yes.
We discovered your husband's body lying next to the tracks of the Paris- Bourdeaux railroad line. He was dressed only in his pajamas. Do you know of any reason why he might have wished to leave France?
Your husband possessed a ticket of passage on the 'Maranguape.' It sailed from Bordeaux for Maracaibo this morning at seven.
"My dear Regina: I hope you are enjoying your holiday. Megeve can be so lovely this time of year. The days pass very slowly and I hope to see you soon. As always, Charles. P.S. Your dentist called yesterday. Your appointment has been changed."  Not very much, is it?
No -- in my room.
Oh, la.
Swell -- only this man doesn't have a garden.
I hope I don't find any little hairy things living up here -- wait! There is something! If I can just -- yes, I'm getting it -- a case of some sort -- it's heavy.
If you think you're getting credit for this, you're crazy.
But he is gone.
I don't know -- how would I know?
Yes, of course. But you will let me know if anyone goes on the critical list 
Sorry. Which view would you like?
Well, you're honest, anyway.
Shakespeare never said that.
It's terrible -- you just made it up.
Doing what?
Instant divorce you mean?
We'll find you a hotel.
I'm still having trouble with English.
What was all that?
What are you doing in here?
You haven't said a word since we left the club -- what happened back there?
I wasn't --
You said this afternoon that your husband was mixed up in something.
What your husband was mixed up in.
Yes -- that's right.
What'd he say?
You mustn't let what he said bother you. It was only words.
Howdy, Miz Lampert.
Sylvie -- I'm getting a divorce.
With a rich husband and this year's clothes you will not find it difficult to make some new friends.
He knows everything.
I hope Jean-Louis understands about last night -- it's just not safe for him to be around me right now.
I'm glad. But what's all this?
Those stamps -- they're worth a fortune!
We took all the chances. The money belongs to us, not him!
Shoot no, not after all these years.
What I don't understand is why they asked Marliston if Rod was a virgin. They could have asked you Cindy.
I'm not fucking you. Not for all your CDS.
Ok not your imports. All your other CDS and your K2 snowboard.
Hi Jody.
IT'S LISA SHERMAN. But she still looks like we're eighteen.
You said that two weeks ago.
Hi honey.
I'm fine. I've just never had someone my age die before. It's so weird.
No. Those two were together before Kenny and I started hanging out and that's over, what, God a year now.
A little.
I'm not.
You found her?
Did you warn her?
What are you doing?
But I shouldn't shut it down?
You fucked me up!
Please get out of my way or I'll have to hurt you.
of COURSE. You're not scared?
Me? Why me?
What do you know about my father?
Don't you want to talk to him? You watch him eat everyday.
I don't know what I'm so scared of.
I promised I'd go right home after school.
Sandy, you have to chill out, at least two-thirds of the kids in our class are still virgins. He can't butcher all of us.
Not that many.
You ok?
Mark invited me to the party.
Shh. Ben's party. Tonight. Haven't you heard?
Kenny'll want to go with you. Cindy's holding a Q and A session at the bleachers. Come on.
This place is empty.
I was supposed to be home fifteen minutes ago.
I was worried about you. Did you hear about the bash?
But if he'd been sent to jail, there would be no Jody.
You flaunt some slut in my face.
Go to the police station!
Thanks for coming back for me.
Oh GOD IT'S HIM!
Lisa Sherman?
She was raped. At least that's what she claimed.
They were proving to her they weren't. They were very drunk. Things were different back then. You think kids are sexually bottled up today....
On what side of the family?
There's Jan and Heather. Let's grab them quick before someone else does.
That wasn't me ...
What, do you work for my boss, dog?
 Oh...
 Oh, shit.
Unbe-fucking-lievable.
Damn.
It's a damn postal truck!
Let me put it in easy terms, Aristotle. We are carrying a damn bomb...
Come on, Night Shift.
...yeah.  Tryin' to get most of my day done before it hits nine-...
Look, you need me to sign an invoice or somethin'?
Since today.  New policy.
Well, he told me to collect cash.
...and fair...
...for Andy, I'll tell him I lost a few cartons comin' over  the mountain.
Sorry, man.  He's dead.
Look, if I don't get this stuff to McGruder, it's goodbye, Andy's Ice Cream, goodbye, Jerome, goodbye, Mon-...
I'll rent the truck from you.  You can stay here, you can go.  Whatever you want.
There we go.  There we go.  Did you keep it safe?  Did you 
Come on, get in the truck.
Damn.

Look...I kinda borrowed the truck from Andy.
...the ice cream for money!
...-damn!

Shut up.
Oh, shit.

Get him to stand up, Night Shift.
    Elvis is on ice again.
Don't gimme that "nice job" shit, man! They still got a vanload comin', and what do you got besides an empty...
Probably because they know a psycho when they hear one.
...let live.
...waiting!
...up!
Come on, old...
...is, old Pete!  Come on, baby!
You think we can make what?!  You see that truck?!

 I should've had that dog bite me.  I would've gotten rabies! Could've went to the hospital, had a pretty nurse!
I'm goin'.  I'm goin', baby.  I'm goin', I'm goin'.
Oh, shit.  Come on, old...
Shut up!
...ho!
All right.
All right.
You're not dangerous!  You're crazy!  I ain't gettin' in this damn thing!


...did you?
See, now why would you do that to a man in my posi-...
Hey, I didn't steal the truck.  You...
...there'd be a sales rep desk with my name on it.  But every time something opened up, there'd be some idiot cousin...
Robert Del Rio?
And  things sort of just went downhill from there.

All right, all right.  Hey, hey.
...deal with this asshole.

Put your hand in my pants.
Arlo!
You just can't leave that stuff with that lu-...
We!
Here...
Whoo!
Stupid.
Come on.  Come on.

Well, hell, the smoke's gonna kill us anyway!
Hang on, hang on.
What'd you come back for?!
You know, we saved half a million people from a full-body peel.
We're the shit.  Bigtime.
Hey-Hey-Hey-Hey-Hey.  We are heroes, my man.  It's time to start actin' like it.
Stop limpin' around like that.
...us.
Bullshit, yeah.  Well...if we're not gonna be famous, at least this'll be a great story to tell some ladies in a bar or somethin'.
I feel faint.
Uh, he handled rackets, and I carried the balls.
 you see, that was a-that was my mission.
Be cool.  Be--

Give it to me now, or you'll be dead...
 Just give me Elvis and I'll make sure you have enough money for a dozen ice cream trucks.
Your move.  Okay, Vaughn, you drive.
...without compunction.
Funny situation, ain't it, Andy?

...Arlo, and you screwed me for it. Now, where's my goddamn truck?
Listen, deputy.
What?  Say again...

If it works, your stock at the Pentagon will go up along with mine.  I don't think I need to mention you could use the help.
...here, and the White House is screaming about chemical weapons,  and we're...
Now listen to me.
"I am become Death, the...

Damn you, Long!  My people are out there! Your people are out there!
...about--
Do you remember telling me once that all through my career, I'd never fit in?  Well...
...men every time I've closed my eyes?  But after you went away, I--
Do you know what'll...
As soon as I heard Elvis was on the loose, you came to mind.
Yeah, I had a small problem with members of our side murdering civil-...
...maybe even Salt Lake, not to mention Casper...
Knowing you, Brynner, you've got buyers waiting to buy! You're not gonna use that...

 Move.  This is already affecting our schedule.
...comes up that road.
Of which we have more than enough.
All right.  Tell the pilot we'll be a half-hour.

Dennis!
I wanna patch in from...
Yeah, he's wanted in connection with a death this morning at the Jerome...
Yes, Captain Brynner, you did, but-but--
...gear?
Actually, I was just looking for a restroom.
Not tonight...
...to die for a country that's...
...the river.



 
Why?  You're a nothing, nobody!  Why?
...it.
Oh, no?
...well, most of the time he looks like something the cat might have dragged in, but, you know...
Uh, we both like to fish.
Rangers.
Hit it...
Thanks. 
The sooner you get up the lab, the sooner you'll figure it out.
Well, I've got Dr. Long's body down at the coroner's office.

...sensitivity without neurosis.  He's...
...without caution...
...fishin'.
The compound has to be kept cold...
Dr.  Long!
 ...miles. 
There's a vent shaft leading straight up.
...you answer mine.
So you don't remember...
I don't sell beer to minors.  I take that kinda thing...
...public drunkenness....
...to talk, son.
I said let me see your hands now!
 Listen, Pappas...
...on the other end of this phone.
...side!
 Wait.  Listen to me, Pappas.  If you don't let us by...
  All right.
Okay, doc.
 Talk to me.
Oh.
Look at that.
Look, pal. I make an honest living. People don't come to me unless they're miserable and I help 'em out of a bad situation. I don't kick them out of their homes like you jerks who work in the bank.
Can I check one of these volumes out?
Lou Escobar  he's a Lieutenant.
None.
If you want an answer to that question I can always put one of my men on the job. Good afternoon, Mr. Cross.
What for?
Why is that funny?
Hollis Mulwray made this city and he made me a fortune... We were a lot closer than Evelyn realized.
Avocado groves?
Well, you don't look any the worse for wear, Mr. Gittes, I must say... where's the girl?...
What does this mean?
I want to know what you're worth. Over ten million?
Hello.
You've got her? Where?
Of course I do. Where are you?
Two hours... tell me, will Evelyn be there as well?
Gee, this is a surprise, Mr. Gittes.
Just sitting down to supper, Jake. Care to join us?
How much do you owe me, Curly?
Tell Mrs. Mulwray to wait for half an hour after you get there. Then if I don't show, take her down to the boat.
That's a filthy habit.
Then what'll you do?
That's just lovely.
Where did you get this material?
The apple core?
How do they do that?
You're behind the times, Jake. They've got steam irons now.  And I'm out of Chinatown.
You wouldn't happen to know the present whereabouts of the young woman.
I don't want it anymore.
No. It was an accident.
I want those photographs, Gittes. We're talking about accessory after the fact, conspiracy, and extortion. Minimum.
It's too late.
Where?
What's the maid's address?
If she's not there, you're going downtown, and you're staying there til she shows up.
I'm sorry, Mrs. Mulwray.
...Well, it didn't make him happy...
You and your husband never discussed her?
Not that Mulwray?
Iced tea.
Yes, Mr. Gittes?
You see, somebody went to a lot of trouble here, and I want to find out, lawsuit or no lawsuit. I'm not the one who's supposed to be caught with my pants down... so I'd like to see your husband. Unless that's a problem.
No. I went riding rather early.
No, Just riding bareback, that's all. Anyway, you might try the Oak Pass or Stone Canyon Reservoirs. Sometimes at lunch Hollis takes walks around them. Otherwise he'll be home by 6:30.
Mrs. Mulwray?... Mrs. Mulwray.
You left your keys in the ignition.
Well, I suppose I am... actually I knew about the affair.
My husband.
Unless what?
Another satisfied client?
Oh, no. I've got my own car. The creamcolored Packard.
Whoever's behind my husband's death, why have they gone to all this trouble?
That dam is a con job.
Everything you can see, everything around us. I was at the Hall of Records today.  That bother you?
There was a memorial service at the Mar Vista Inn today for Jasper Lamar Crabb. He died three weeks ago.
Maid's night off?
It was in Chinatown.
Boy oh boy, you're a mess.
Hold still. Why?
...No. Why was it.
Oh that... It's a flaw in the iris...
I want you to listen to me. My father is a very dangerous man. You don't know how dangerous. You don't know how crazy.
Okay, give me the keys.
I took your husband's Buick...  I'll return it tomorrow.
You know any good criminal lawyers?
There's no time for you to be shocked by the truth, Mrs. Mulwray. The coroner's report proves he was killed in salt water. Just take my word for it. Now I want to know how it happened and why. I want to know before Escobar gets here because I want to hang onto my license.
Stop it!  I'll make it easy. You were jealous, you fought, he fell, hit his head. It was an accident, but his girl is a witness. You've had to pay her off. You don't have the stomach to harm her, but you've got the money to shut her up. Yes or no?
I said I want the truth.
...he had a breakdown... the dam broke... my mother died... he became a little boy... I was fifteen... he'd ask me what to eat for breakfast, what clothes to wear!... It happened... then I ran away...
I'll take care of it.
Listen, we can't string this broad out indefinitely we got to come up with something.
Hello, Miss Sessions. I don't believe we've had the pleasure.
Shut the fuck up!  ...Yes I remember nothing, Miss Sessions, just going over a detail or two with my associates... you were saying?
Yeah, Sophie.
Mind if I take one of your cards? In case I want to get in touch with you again.
Mr. Gittes, sorry to keep you waiting. These staff meetings, they just go on and on.
You ought to be more careful. That must really smart.
Mr. Gittes, you're not making a bit of sense.
You're a married man, am I right?
Do you know me?
It's bone dry, Morty.
Gittes?... Gittes?
Lot of turnover these days. Better tell them to get in touch with me if they want to hang onto their land.
It's personal. Has he been out long?
Mr. Yelburton will be busy for some time.
This?
What's that, pal?
She must be about thirty-three, thirty- four.
You must not come here! How many times do I have to tell you?  If the film catches fire, runt that you are, you'd go up in a burst of flame...whoosh! And turn into a piece of...
I told my mother you weren't the one who gave me the films. That it wasn't your fault. But I thought you said the film could catch fire just to scare me. Now that I know, I won't steal any more from you. That's all I wanted to say. I'm going. 
Now listen to what I've got to say. I took up this profession when I was ten years old. In those days there weren't these modern machines. The films were silent. The projectors were run by hand, like this, with a crank. And you wound the crank all day long. It was really rough going! If you got tired and slowed down' boom! Everything would go up in flames!
Because I'm an idiot. How many other guys in town know how to be a projectionist? None! Only a jerk like me could do it. Besides I wasn't lucky. When I was a kid there was the war! When I grew up, another war! Now it's all different. Times have changed. And you want to be a dope like me? Huh? Answer me!
How's school?
Toto, are you pulling my leg or something? How is it possible to see this television without film?
Did you ever see her again? 
Do like the soldier, Toto! Go away! This land is cursed.  When you're here every day you feel like you're at the center of the universe, it seems like nothing ever changes. Then you go away, one year, two...And when you come back, everything's different. The thread has broken. You don't find those you were looking for, your things no longer exist. Isn't that the case?...You've got to go away a long time, for many, many years, before coming back and finding your people again, the land where you were born...But not now, it's impossible. Now you're blinder than I am. 
But Alfredo, what you're saying is horrifying!
I don't care. I'll wait.
My husband...you know him.
No, Salvatore...there is no future. There's only the past. Even meeting last night was nothing but a dream, a beautiful dream.  We never did it when we were kids, remember?  Now that it's happened, I don't think there could have been a better ending. 
How long's it been shut?
That's fine, Mr. Kane.
Mr. Kane -
Of her acting, it is absolutely impossible to say anything except that it represents a new low...  Have you got that, Mr. Bernstein? In the opinion of this reviewer -
My Declaration of Principles -  Don't smile, Brad -  Take dictation, Mr. Bernstein -
Oh, yes, it's already made up.  Our Mr. Mervin wrote a small review.
Yes, very!  Naturally.
Who's a busy man?  Me?  I'm Chairman of the Board.  I got nothing but time ...  What do you want to know?
Who else you been to see?
Isn't it wonderful?  Such a party!
Mr. Bernstein, am I a stuffed shirt? Am I a horse-faced hypocrite?  Am I a New England school-marm?
If you thought I'd answer different from what Mr. Kane tells you - well, I wouldn't.
Well, he'll be coming back in September. The Majestic.  I got the reservations. It gets in on the ninth.
But, Mr. Kane -
Mr. Kane, this is a surprise!
Let him finish, Charles.
What story, Mr. Rogers?
Emily, you -
There's a call I want you to make with me, Charles.
Charles, if you don't listen to reason, it may be too late -
You can't blackmail me, Rogers, you can't -
Get out, both of you!
Ow!
You've got some on your face.
Hey, you should be more careful. That's my ma and pa.
Thanks.
A rooster?
Is that what you want to do?
What happened to the singing? You're not in a show, are you?
Don't tell me your toothache is bothering you again?
Charlie!  I said, what time is it?
I'm not going to have my guests insulted, just because you think -  - if people want to bring a drink or two along on a picnic, that's their business.  You've got no right -
Oh, I'm sick and tired of you telling me what I must and what I musn't do!
Oh, I don't mean the things you've given me - that don't mean anything to you.  What's the difference between giving me a bracelet or giving somebody else a hundred thousand dollars for a statue you're going to keep crated up and never look at?  It's only money.  It doesn't mean anything. You're not really giving anything that belongs to you, that you care about.
She doesn't know, Mrs. Kane.  She just sent it - because I made her see it wouldn't be smart for her not to send it.
Anything you say, Mr. Kane.  Only we're talking now about what you are.  That's what the note is about, Mrs. Kane.  Now I'm going to lay all my cards on the table.  I'm fighting for my life.  Not just my political life.  My life.  If your husband is elected governor -
You're the greatest fool I've ever known, Kane.  If it was anybody else, I'd say what's going to happen to you would be a lesson to you.  Only you're going to need more than one lesson. And you're going to get more than one lesson. 
I came to see you, Charles, about your - about the Enquirer's campaign against the Metropolitan Transfer Company.
Mrs. Kane would like to see you, Mr. Kane.
I've changed the front page a little, Mr. Bernstein.  That's not enough - There's something I've got to get into this paper besides pictures and print -  I've got to make the "New York Enquirer" as important to New York as the gas in that light.
The "Chronicle" is a good newspaper.
They do it only because you do!
I mean I've got a job for you.
I said treason was a capital offense punishable by death -
Charlie!  Now you're not making sense.
First of all, I will not write a good review of a play because somebody paid a thousand dollars for an advertisement in the "Enquirer."
She can leave me.  As a matter of fact, I've already left her.  Don't worry, Brad - I'll live.
It does seem too good to be true, doesn't it, Mr. Bernstein?
It's going to be done exactly the way I've told Mr. Thatcher -
Mr. Leland, you were -
Brief marriage!  Ten years! 
Yes, and maybe he didn't.
I'll get to it right away, Mr. Rawlston.
You can go on asking questions if you want to.
Why don't you people let me alone? I'm minding my own business.  You mind yours.
How do you want to handle the whole thing - ask questions?
I did a lot of singing after that. I sang for Charlie -  I sang for teachers at a hundred bucks an hour - the teachers got that, I didn't -
In case you've never heard of how I lost all my money - and it was plenty, believe me -
Well, if it's already too late...
Fifty-five.
Yeah, but not in here.
Randal Graves-scourge of the video renter.
You're kidding.
Train. It took eight hours.
You saw it?
I was going to tell you. But then we were getting along so well, I didn't want to mess it up.
Then my mother called me this morning and told me the announcement was in the paper. That's when I hopped the train to come back here, because I knew you'd be a wreck.
You don't have anything to do with it.
I'm sure Sang and-Veronica?-would like that.
You work in a market, all right.
Jerk. Here I am, throwing myself at you, succumbing to your wily charms, and you call me a slut, in so many words.
He's not invited.
Where'd he go?  I'd have thought he'd be at your side, like an obedient lapdog.
You're too responsible. But no. I have to go home first. They don't even know I left school. And I should break the disengagement news to my mother, which is going to cause quite a row, considering she loves Sang.
I'm serious.
Are you sure somebody was back there?
I don't know. He just came in and asked to use the bathroom.
Using filthy language in front of the customers... you should both get fired.
If you can just wait a few more minutes.
Who are you to make assessments?
Excuse me, do you have...
So?
What smells like shoe polish?
You win.
Party at John K's-senior year. I get blitzed and pass out in his bedroom. Caitlin comes in and dives all over me.
In the middle of it, she calls me Brad.
More or less.
Now the first one they built was completed and fully operational before the Rebels destroyed it.
She's in here?
What's he looking for?
What did he say?
Did you ever notice all the prices end in nine? Damn, that's eerie.
Nudie booth?
I'm gonna hear it tomorrow.
The women that go through every gallon of milk looking for a later date. As if somewhere-beyond all the other gallons-is a container of milk that won't go bad for like a decade.
So, what-you're stuck here all day?
Why'd you apologize?
Design major.
Look who you're asking here. How're we gonna block off the street?
Helluva game!
Bitch, bitch, bitch. You want something to drink? 
What happened to all the Gatorade?
Julie Dwyer died.
Why not?
What!?
She meant nothing to you!
I can't close the store.
She was pretty young, hunhh?
That's nothing compared to how my cousin Walter died.
Broke his neck.
Shut the hell up.
Because I never tried to suck my own dick?
He made it, hunhh?
I could never reach.
You know.
I like to expand my horizons.
You're lying.
Then why aren't you like screaming at me right now?
You want me to bring the VCR over here so we can watch this?
I love your sexy talk. It's so... kindergarten: Poo-poo; wee-wee.
Maybe the Asian design major slipped her some opium?
She said she did all the work.
Thirty-seven.
I'm satisfied with my situation for now. You don't hear me bitching. You, on the other hand, have been bitching all day.
Who're you kidding? You can so.
How's your eye?
I thought I was doing you a favor.
Like ten after.
To say the least.
Just the paper.
Caitlin Bree. Yeah?
I'm surprised you never found out about it, Dante. Everybody in school knew-even in my class.
Oh, I do. You made the same noise when you reached across the counter for my cash. Your muscles are thin and sadly underutilized.
Oh for God's sake!
And your name is Dante Hicks? You went to high school with her? You played hockey?
Wait a second!  You used to sleep with Caitlin Bree? While I was dating her?
Are there any balls down there?!
How many times I gotta tell you not to deal outside the store.
Noinch, noinch, noinch-smoking weed, smoking weed! Doing coke!  Drinking beers!  A pack of wraps, my good man. It's time to kick back, drink some beers, and smoke some weed!
Hell yes, whatever that means. Now I'm gonna head over to Atlantic, drink some beers, get ripped, and- please God-get laid.  E-Z Wider, one-and-a-halfs.
Relax brother. What I mean is that you sell the stuff in this store at the highest prices around. A dollar seventy-nine for wraps-what's that shit?
And these aren't my drugs-I just sell them.
Probably saw that Caitlin chick. I know I felt like beatin' it when I saw her.  Come here, bitch! You like this? Is this what you want? Hunhh?
Don't you already have a girlfriend?
Is she that girl who's down here all the time? She came here today carrying a plate of food.
Such a wiseass. But go ahead. Crack wise. That's why you're jockeying a register in some fucking local convenience store instead of doing an honest day's work.  I got no more time to bullshit around waiting for that sonofabitch.  You make sure this gets back. The number's eight-twelve-Wynarski. And I wanted to get a damn movie, too.
The white kind.
Actually, it is kind of rough.
Say, young fella, you know I hate to bother you again, but can I take a paper or something back there... to read?  It usually takes me a while, and I like to read while it's going on.
You know, you probably could've been home, already, in the time it's taken you to get in there.
At least they weren't lit.
All I'm saying is that if you're unhappy you should leave.
I know. I stopped by your house and your mom said you left at like six or something.
What were you doing?
How much money did you leave up there?
You're trusting.
I was kidding.
Typically male point of view.
I'm insulted. Believe me, Don Juan, it takes more than that to get a guy off. Just "being there"-as you put it-is not enough.
Three?
All right. Name it.
He requested this?
Like you said-she snowballed him.
You sucked that guy's dick?
Oh my God-I feel so nauseous...
How many dicks have you sucked?!
HOW MANY?
Well...?
WHAT? SOMETHING LIKE THIRTY-SIX?
Well... why did you have to suck their dicks? Why didn't you just sleep with them, like any decent person?!
I feel sick.
Really?  You're the best.
The ostrich syndrome: if you don't see it...
What the fuck did you do that for?
What're you talking about?
A couple...?
What are you talking about?
I didn't do that!
Yeah, but I didn't sell cigarettes to any kids!
Did he say "making fuck?"
Come on, man, "Berserker!"
Oh my God! You're Rick Derris?
Holy shit! She told you about that!  Buddy of mine worked there. Said he watched the whole thing. They used to film people at that hotel; nobody knew about it.
Sure. How about the beach?
Well this is the last time I ever rent here...
Says me. I've been here for half an hour. I'd call that first dibs.
Like hell you are!
Twenty bucks?
Did you catch that thunder?
Next time you're like watching MTV, y' know, like flip it to the weather channel for a split second and check it out.  I mean, hey, we could be home watching some righteous pornos.
Ready to die quiet-like, asshole.
Hey, Jessie, you're just in time for another masterpiece.
That was the first and last question-- now only answers. Where's the chopper?
Looks like the Tower.  It's a bad climb.
Where are you, Walker?
Can't pass up another chance to play hero, can you.
What the hell do you know about bad time.  You didn't love her, you didn't have to explain to her family.
No, buddy, it was you who dropped it!
Forget me.  If you can, get away.
Room service...Hi, Sarah.
How're ya feeling?
Please -- oh, no -- please!
Use your other hand!  Grab it!
Course maybe you don't have to wait until I faint.
Gabe, did you come back to stay?  You didn't.
I know you don't want to be responsible for anybody's life anymore, but walk away and you are responsible.  Please Gabe, he went up the west ridge.  If you go up the south face, you can catch him, no problem--
Frank dropped me in the west valley and I hiked.  You look frozen.  What's happening?!
Take off and meet me at Eagle Cave.
It was great.
Can you think of something more romantic than attacked?
We have to get through to the other side.  You up for it?
What was God thinking when he built this place?
Gabe are you alright?
They'll kill him!  He has no idea!
We might be able to go that way.
Start pulling it apart!  We're climbing down on it.
Never, what?!
Thanks for holding on.
There's no "we".  There's a me. All I have to do is make it along the north wall to Bitker Ladder. What you're doing is going back down to the station to get help. And don't put on that mad face.
But maybe with a good start I can hit those hand-holds.
We don't have time to argue about it!
Take the rope.
What about you?!
The "old mouth to mouth" resuscitation routine.
Your mouth's writing a check your ass can't cash, but if ya wanna buy some life, bring me the money.
Right.
Kill me?  Christ we're partners in this!
Bring down the money or your friend's dead!
You got what we need?
No names, this is an open line!
I'd like to have a word with you. This is Agent Matheson, FBI.
I think Treasury personnel are the most superstitious people in the federal government.
Sorry about the pain. Using the gulliver to much like, eh? Giving orders and disciplining and that perhaps, eh? You sure the pain's gone? You sure you'll not be happier back up in bed.
One minoota, droogie. Dim smashes Alex in the face with a full milk bottle. He goes down. The others run away, laughing.
Come on, Alex. Come for walkies. Hahahahaha.
Been cured, yeah, that was read out to us. The Inspector read all that out to us. He said it was a very good way.
Good evening, sir.
I'm so pleased you appreciate good wine. Have another glass!
My wife... Alex freezes.
Excuse me, missus, can you please help? There's been a terrible accident. Can I please use your telephone for an ambulance?
Hi, hi, hi there, at last we meet.
You see, madam, I am part of an international student's contest to see who can get the most points for selling magazines.
Hullo.
Why didn't you let us know what was happening, son?
No time, no time, yes. Sit, sit, sit. Alex sits next to him.
I've just come back from the hospital. Your victim has died.
It's alright, thank you.
You mean Beethoven's 9th Symphony?
When you say this funny feeling, you mean the state of mind brought on by the treatment they gave you?
Not tonight - not this nochy.
Thank you, sir.
Helping you, sir?
No thanks, Mum. It'll pass in a minute...  ... What have you done with all my own personal things?
What about Basil? Where's my snake?
What do I want?
You want to know why I did that, well you see - I do that... He stamps on Alex's foot.
Let me get up.
You are now in H.M. Prison Parkmoor and from this moment you will address all prison officers as sir! Name?
Yes sir.
Do you wear eye glasses or contact lenses?
No, sir.
You're absolutely right, sir.
Oh no, nothing of the sort.
Well, that was a very promising start. By my calculations, you should be starting to feel alright again. Yes? Dr. Brodsky's pleased with you. Now tomorrow there'll be two sessions, of course, morning and afternoon.
I imagine you'll be feeling a little bit limp by the end of the day. But we have to be hard on you. You have to be cured.
I'm your Psychiatrist.
Patients who've sustained the kind of injuries you have often have dreams of this sort. It's all part of the recovery process.
Isn't the plumage beautiful?
Good. It wa your fault... you sold me a crummy watch. I want my money back.
Good. What do you want?
Good. You can do whatever you like with these.
Very soon now the drug will cause the subject to experience a death- like paralysis together with deep feelings of terror and helplessness. One of our earlier test subjects described it as being like death, a sense of stifling and drowning, and it is during this period we have found the subject will make his most rewarding associations between his catastrophic experience and environment and the violence he sees. Alex retching violently and struggling against his strait jacket.
Can you spare me some cutter, me brother? Can you spare some cutter, me brother? Alex, without looking at him, reaches in his pocket and gives him some money.
No Father. It's nothing like that, Father. It's about this new thing they're all talking about. About this new treatment that you out of prison in no time at all and makes sure you never get back in again.
Instruct thy son and he shall refresh thee and shall give delight to thy soul.
One pair of trousers - blue pinstriped.
One pair of underpants - white with blue waistband.
Sir, 655321, sir.
Yeah... Pete the English.
I wonder where exactly is it he goes to work of evenings.
Sixth is faster.
But Bowery's fine, if that's what you want.
Keep it.  Go wild.  Have a party.
You never answered my question.  You like what you do?
But not now?
Did you say <u>Dmitri?</u> How do you know about my case?  I don't understand...
Where are you, what floor?
He doesn't know you're up there!  Just stay right where you are!  Call the police!
A deer?
...I was just a young cat back then, about nineteen, bussin' tables in this very place.  Didn't pay but shit, but that wasn't the point.  Being around the music, that was the thing.  And I was.  Take this one night...July 22, 1964...who walks in?  Mr. Louis Armstrong.
He'd come over from Queens to do the Ed Sullivan show.  After, he decides to come on up to Harlem and hang with the common folk.  That's how he was, you see.  Never forgot where he came from.  Money and fame an' all that?  Meant nothin', long as he could blow that horn.  So before you it, he's up on that stage, doin' his thing.
And here I was thinking you were such a nice guy.
One more thing.  If by some chance I get this wrong...tell Dmitri I'm sorry.
I see.  That was an important list, wouldn't you say?  The people on that list are being subpoenaed tomorrow by a federal judge.  And you "lost" it?
The fat man on Cherry Street.  The other fat man, Mr. Bulldozer.  The trumpet player.  That leaves two.
Hell, make it fifty.  Same goes for any business we have in the future.
...goddamn it, you telling me this motherfucker's whacked three of our witnesses tonight...
...so, his description of Max the cabdriver matches the guy who walked out of Villa Rodeo.  That guy?  That guy is a cabbie.  And you're telling me this cabbie walks into a phone booth and emerges as a meat eater, assassin with heavy trigger time? What's he do, squeeze 'em in between fares?
Captain Walt Muldoon, NYPD.
What if they're wrong?
Client?  I like to think of myself as more of a friend.  A mentor.
Quite an achievement...
Hi, Ma.
I came to see you, you look fine.  We gotta go.
You're kidding me.
How am I supposed to not get excited, listening to you trying to extort your employee, you sarcastic prick?
Same fare you talked to last time. The U.S. Attorney...
Yeah?  So?
Yeah?
First time in New York?
It's home.
You on some kind of work plan?
Why not?
What?
You listening to me?
Try harder.  I'm gonna count to three. One...
I'm making <u>you</u> nervous.  I'm the one with a schedule.
You better?
58th and Central.  You know it?
Oh.  Oh, no.  You're kidding.  We...
You said you were visiting friends!
I should only kill people after I get to know 'em?  Six billion people on the planet, you're getting bent out of shape 'cause of one fat guy?
That one's probably married.  Think of his kids.  His wife's pregnant...
So what?
Collateral damage.
What you mean, no?
Pull your head out of your ass.  Get your thinking straight.  You wanna die?
Show up for what?
Maybe so.  Maybe she hears what you tell her.
It's cause they don't like their lives, so they project their patterns of negative behavior onto you...  I had a father like that.
He hated everything I did.  Hated me. Got drunk and beat the shit out of me, daily...
Don't be.  I never saw him after I was 15.  Went into the military early.  So all this talk about "my job's temporary, I got big plans," it's all bullshit.
I'll just hold onto it for you.  In case they check.
You're gonna be me.  You're gonna go in, and you're gonna get the info on the remaining two hits.
No client has ever seen my face, and I intend to keep it that way.  Besides, if he decides to put a bullet in my head, I don't wanna be there for it.
Who's Heller?
It's what I do for a living.
How are you at math?  I was hired for five hits.  I did four.
How do I know?  But, they all got that "witnesses for the prosecution" look to me.  Probably some major federal indictment against somebody who majorly does not want to get indicted...  I dunno.
That's the "why."  That's the why? There is no reason.  No good reason; no bad reason.  To live or to die.
Look in the mirror.  ...piss-ant paper towels...a bottle of 409...saving up for goin' to the Comoros.  How much you got saved?
Well.  That was brilliant.
The sound of love.
She must be some girl.
Are you crazy?!
I was only going one way.
Sure.  And the two of 'em used my legs for a wishbone.  Nearly snapped me in half.
I don't see the connection.
I still don't see what it has to do with the President.
You going to warn him?
You think I'm crazy.
I won't be here when you get back, but I'll be in touch.  And thanks.
You saved my life.
Flat, wraparound headlights?
Crown Victoria.  F.B.I. car.  A legitimate tail.
How long have we known each other, Jerry?
That's it?
You okay?
Equitation.
'On July 8, 1979, security forces under control of the Trilateral Commission abducted the fathers of all American Nobel Prize winners. The men, many of them octogenarians, were forced at gunpoint to ejaculate into small plastic bottles.  The sperm collected is now under study in a laboratory beneath the headquarters of the Rand Corporation in Santa Monica, California.'
Holden Caulfield?  <u>Catcher in the</u> <u>Rye</u>?
That was him.
Please put it down.
Jesus... It's my fault.  They drew a black line over me and now I'm passing it on.  I'm passing it to you, too.
Cold War's over, Jerry.
You will?
I know that.  I'm just -- I'm nervous.  I reached out and grabbed the first thing out there. I know they're song lyrics.  And I know how I feel.
Yeah...  Would you, I mean, could you love me then?  If I was normal.  Maybe?
Yesterday you were wondering about the wall.  How it was possible.
Are you okay?  I wish I hadn't told you what I did.  But I can't help the way I feel.  You don't hold that against me, do you?
We're going to Queens?
What about them?
John Hinkley.  The guy who shot Reagan.  He only had two names.
My father's house.
Did you kill my father?!
Then tell me what happened.
<u>Why not, Jerry</u>?
You got to get out of here.  My cell phone's on.  Back in the truck.
Without a song in my heart.
Blue moon...
Geronimo is down.
I love you, too.
Who have you been talking to, Jerry?  Who else knows what you know?
Then screw you.  I'll rot.
Can I ask you something?
Years ago, I worked for the C.I.A. in the M.K. ULTRA program.  Are you familiar with it?
We experimented with hallucinogens.  We used electro- shock to produce a vegetative state.  We conducted terminal experiments in sensory deprivation.
Me?  I was a minor missionary, a heretic really.  But where else could a red-blooded American boy lie, cheat, steal and kill with the sanction and blessings of the All-Highs?  Besides, now I'm trying to pay my penance.
Jerry told me he bit your nose.
These things you're talking about. You did them to Jerry?
I'm still listening.
Federal Bureau of Investigation.
Tell him I'm on vacation.  That I won't be back for two weeks.
I've been given a cease and desist on all matters relating to Jerry Fletcher.  We're not to discuss him with the press, the N.Y.P.D., anyone.  Building police are to arrest him on sight and we're to report any attempt he makes to contact you.
Guy's a C.I.A. shrink.  Here to I.D. Fletcher.  They knew each other somehow.
Which way did he go?
Jonas?
When I'm ready to compare notes, I'll let you know.
Can I talk to you a second?
Jonas builds assassins for a living.  Several of whom may be in place already.  We'd like to kill a few birds with one stone.
No idea.  Honest.  What are you going to do?
That you come with me.
We've lost contact.
You don't believe it to be... tell me something, Doctor.  Why do you think they would go to all this trouble... bring you tens of thousands of light years, and then send you home without a shred of proof?  Sort of bad form, wouldn't you say?  What was their intent?
And only two probabilities:  One: there is intelligent life in the universe but they're so far away you'll never contact it in your lifetime --
I disagree.
I'm surprised you even knew it was an election year.
Ellie...
Ellie, I should have done this a long time ago, certainly before I left the N.S.F., but I wanted to give you every benefit of the doubt --
The point is, this isn't just scientific inquiry anymore -- it's turned into some kind of personal obsession.
Then why haven't you detected any signals?  If, as you claim, there have been thousands, millions of advanced civilizations out there for millions of years then why hasn't one signal gotten through?  It'll take a month or two for the paperwork to go through; you're welcome to stay until then.
You mean --
I'm asking for your help, David.  I want to go.  They'll need someone relatively young, unattached -- and probably a scientist.  As the President's Science Advisor you have enormous weight... I'm asking if you'll support my candidacy.
Right.  Well.
Ellie... we both know that if I was any kind of a man, I never would've entered this race.  That I would have told the President straight out:  Helen, Eleanor Arroway is naive and strident and an enormous pain in the ass... but she's got more courage and intelligence than the rest of us put together.  That more then anyone else on the planet, she's earned this.  And that she should be the one to go because she's the best we have.  But that's not who I am.  I like to think it's who I might've been if things had gone a different way; that I might have been worthy, really worthy of what I've been given...  You do what you have to do.  And in the end, as with everything, it comes down to power.  And it isn't fair...
... And while its function remains, for the moment, a mystery, my best guess is that it represents a transport of some kind.
And?
I used... I used to dream you were alive... and then I'd wake up and lose you all over again.
You're not real.  None of this is.
Why did you contact us?
So who...?
That isn't the way it works.
You live here.
A machine.  But a machine that does what?
Mr. Hadden, I'm a scientist; I don't make deals... But.  If you wish to give me, in good faith, access to your information, I can assure you that I will exert all reasonable efforts to promote your cause wherever it doesn't conflict with the best interests of science... or my better judgment.
What are you talking about?  It's over.
Why don't you come back with me?
I thought you were here because you want to go.
I read your paper on ETI's.  It's brilliant.
But what about your research -- ?
It's all right, the important thing is you're safe --
I had... an experience.  Of belonging.  Of unconditional love. And for the first time in my life I wasn't terrified, and I wasn't alone.
Do you love your parents?
It's too... elegant.  The degree of economy is extraordinary; it's really the next logical step... Even on Earth technology has always aspired to a condition of nature. D.N.A. outclasses any computer we can come up with; the human body is the most exquisitely designed machine imaginable.
Losing Faith:  The Search For Meaning In the Age of Reason. Catchy.
Did you ever stop to think that maybe that isn't science's fault, but meaning's?
And yet you're willing to die for this cause, the one thing that's given your life a sense of purpose. Don't you see the contradiction here -- ?
What are you so afraid of?
Ellie, there is no reason you have to be alone.
Hi.
You're sure you want to?  In the universe I saw we're not exactly the stars of the show.  What happened to me makes us all seem pretty damn small.
You kill me, you really do.  The first truly global, a-political event in history and you can't wait to spin it.
I guess I'd say I trust us enough to believe our response would be something to the effect of, thanks for the advice, but no thanks.  But to dilute or censor the truth, for whatever reason --
... as have all attempts at internal analysis.  We've tried sonargrams, magnetic resonance, gamma rays; it's completely impenetrable.
Boss, I made an arrangement with that man to take his broom.
I don't think you understand. We made a deal ---
I'm lucky I got a broom. Work up top. Real easy job. Man, it's gonna be hot down in that ditch.
Fifty cents? Sweet job like that worth at least a buck.
Buck is a deal.
Well, Arletta, I got to stand down here.
You never thought that's a heavy load?
No. But things ain't always like they seem, Arletta. You know that. A man's gotta go his own way.
Yeah.
We call it abuildin' time, Arletta.
Nothin' to do with it. I ain't never give John the kind of feelin' I give you, so I'm payin' him off now. Don't feel you got to say anything. Way it is, sometimes, you just have a feelin' for a child or you don't, and with John I just didn't.
Gotta have kings.
Tell us about it.
Comin' out here, Boss?
You was eyeballin', Luke. You can't gitcha mind on them weeds if yer eyeballin'...
What's all this dirt in the yard?
You got your mind right, Luke?
Supposin' you was to backslide on us, Luke? Supposin' you was to backsass or try to run again...
You cut that up fer lunch, Luke.
Captain says to wait 'til the Patrol gits here.
You was to sell your job, maybe this Lucas War Hero would give you a price.
Borrowin' or payin' back?
Oh lookit that brunette.
A cold drink.
Well, whatta we got here?
Whatta you so happy about?
Shut your mouth 'bout my Lucille.
I'm gonna kill you, you go on...
They don't know iff'n to smile, spit or swallow.
'Atsa sign I got me an affectionate nature.
Not a liar. You just have a common -- and likable -- tendency toward exaggeration.
Nobody kin eat fifty eggs.
What's the writing say?
That ole box collapse and fall apart before Luke calls quits.
Oh Lord!
Man, you play like a kokonut. You got to call him at least.
Oh no, man! Not on this hot muther.
Yeah, found one in this supermarket, keys in the ignition.
Picture's a phoney... Cost me a week's pay.
He'll never make it.
Big deal paper hanger! Hell, anyone who can write can pass fifty-sixty dollar checks. Like breakin' open a piggy bank.
Where were you?  Don't tell me. It's just under seventy, right?  The sun is strong but the air is dry and fresh...
I got it myself... I couldn't wait.
He can't phone you unless the warden gets an okay from you.  Did you give him an approval?
You parked right behind him.  The one I noticed earlier.  I didn't say anything, I thought he'd leave. Just take a look.
But earlier, he was staring up here.  <u>Please</u>, Andy.
What?  What'd I do?
The moon is up, my night to howl. Will you be okay?
You're fired.
You bastard!
Are you staying long?  Shall I shut the door?  Make your coffee?  Make the beds?
We'll get the paramedics...
The test criteria are only part of what we look at in evaluating subjects.
I never hurt nobody...
Where is it?
She's supposed to have it.
What book?
What was that?  What am I hearing? The sound of an epiphany, a sudden blinding insight?
You've been perfect.  Don't spoil the symmetry -- you have to have a male cop.
Yes.  I do.  I want it to end now. Let her go.  I'll come -- just let her go.  She's not important.
Kill me, Peter, do it, now.
Who?
Sugar and cream for Goetz; I take mine black.  You're absolutely correct.  The politicians don't want panic headlines spoiling the Festival of Love.
Would you want to work with us on this?
Where are the stockings he strangled them with?
Can you make a copy we can show on our computers?
I am not going to look at any more pictures.  They're like a disease. They get into my head.  I can't get them out.
She was killed somewhere else and dumped outdoors in an empty lot. Where it says "no dumping."  Her legs pulled apart in a kind of sexual pose.   It's all different but it seems so -- the same. Artificial and <u>posed</u>... Something's wrong with it.
He comes in the window, we maybe grab him.  Where's the on-switch?
There were needle marks.  But no drugs in her blood.
Is that it?
Helen, hang up, let Ruben get on with his work...
They put  Merry <u>Saks</u> on it?!
What I can't believe is that in an earlier life I slept with him! Christ!  Any God that loved his people would give women a rewind on their life and an erase button.  Just give me a minute here.  The letter is addressed to me...  You don't feel fear, do you? You're young.  You feel like you'll live forever.  How wonderful.
The University computer is down for maintenance, but I've been going through my own notes...
Helen.  I saw him die.  I saw him burning on the basement stairs, he never reached the top.
Somebody is imitating his m.o. Look for a plumber or carpenter or handyman; that's how deSalvo got in the door and caught them off guard.
It's a game they like to play. Berkowitz -- "Son of Sam" -- hung around the crime scene, talking to the cops.  This one's probably watching <u>you</u>, laughing at you.
It's gone.  The file's not here.  What did you do?
Are you always so bold?
Don't hang up!
You know how to use this?
I was just about to advise the Inspector here not to show Dr. Hudson the note.
Get Mercer to run the medical, dental, legal bills, laundry and dry cleaning receipts, extermin- ators, mailmen, grocery and drugstore deliveries, handymen, plumbers...
You damn well better start working on that impulse control.  A woman who is implicated in this case? Someone who's practically a piece of <u>evidence</u>?
The woman was in shock.  She was totally out on ranks.  I stayed because I didn't want her to wake up alone in a place where she'd just been under attack.  Stop that, you son of a bitch!  The place wasn't secure.  I was doing my goddamn job!  And, for the <u>second time</u>, I slept in her living room.
You messed with the scene.
I tagged the goddamned stocking. It ain't lost.  We're sequestering that evidence.  That's the trap some son of a bitch is going to fall into...
This is the anniversary of the summer of love and your city fathers have declared a Festival of Love.  The Mayor and Chamber of Commerce don't want TV announcing killers on the loose.
What are you looking at that for? Helen Hudson.  Work the clues.
What the hell you need her for?
M.J., I'm going to have to borrow Ruben.  The alien-smuggling thing in Chinatown is going down tomorrow night and Jack's kid got hit by a car.  I gotta give Ruben to Nikko.
The prowler in Hudson's apartment turns out to have a meeting with a suspect...
How'd you get in on the deal?
You have no authority to make a deal like that.  That' s for the D.A...
He's not treating her right...
We were together six years, sir!
She knows I'm Catholic!  She never mentioned divorce!  Not once!
Put in the Kevin Costner.
Poor darling.  What can I do about Karen? How can I arrange to have her seduce me? She desperately needs a conquest.
If I groundloop during my flying lesson on Saturday you might wake up and find me next to you.
Have you seen it?
I wish I had. They bury the dead so quickly - they should leave them lying around for months.
They're questioning Vaughan about an accident near the airport. Some pedestrian... they think he was run over intentionally.
You'd better drive him. He's a bit shaky. I'll follow in my car. Where is yours?
The traffic... where is everyone? They've all gone away.
I don't think we should have come here. I'm surprised the police don't make it more difficult.
I take it you're not wearing white to reassure them.
And you had sex with all of these men in cars? Only in cars?
You were the last one I saw just before the accident. Do you remember? We made love.
What does he want from you?
Why are the police taking this all so seriously?
No, I mean a crash with a history. Camus' Facel Vega, or Nathaniel Nest's station wagon, Grace Kelly's Rover 3500. Fix it just enough to get it rolling. Don't clean it, don't touch anything else.
I want to see my mother immediately.
First you tell me to do what I want to, then you tell me to stop.
She says she won't even come if Dad brings Monica.
How?
Oh, wait a minute, now I see where you're going.
Maybe, though. Maybe it would work. I could throw you an engagement party maybe.
Things have been kind of stressful lately.
Everything's ready for tomorrow night--except the artillery.
You're slowing.
Oh, Ruthie, what am I going to do?
Mom, please.
I gather he's late as usual.
Maybe I should talk about this with Ruth, or Paul.
Yes.
It's so good to see you, Sweetheart.
Which flowers did you order?
I hear this Michael fellow is schizophrenic.
Don't forget that Paul's a promising young attorney who loves you very much...
I'm so thankful you'll be leaving next week. If you want me to pick you up, I will.
Mom, we agreed. You can visit, but you're not allowed to mention Michael.
It had this red spot on its back.
I don't mean to go on and on like this.
You missed out on some great broccoli florets at dinner.
For a price.
We'll get caught.
I had to sneak by the guards to get here. They say you're highly unstable, have a depressive personality, and may hold back my own recovery.
What's my rap?
I wish I could have seen that.
The mission up in Santa Barbara.
What else would you do?
And we'd eat Spaghetti-O's in bed from the can.
Then it's over.
You're right. I guess I was projecting. What I should have said is, "It's a good thing I love you."
Furnished?
I love the pillows.
Sounds good. Oh, and Letty?
I bombed. It's either work in the office or nothing.
Promise?
Aunt Lily is the one who married your father's cousin?
Oh. And, Harry, he's the one who likes magic?
What?
Silly, silly, silly.
Don't you have a magic trick or something to make this easier?
So, another one bites the dust.
I was thinking dinner on Friday with James and Meg at the Saint Mark.
Actually, I need to review the deposition questions tonight. Maybe tomorrow?
What are you doing?    You're going to be late.
You know what I think we need? Martinis. How about martinis to celebrate?
I hope it wasn't something I did.
No.
I talked to Ruth a little bit, and I think it's about time...
I hope you like it. It's a Marquis cut, 1.5 carats. They had one with emeralds around it, but this was simpler, more classic in its lines.  Letty?
You what?
Who?
Have you been seeing another teacher?
How's work going?    Are you back at school?
It's a very nice letter. But I have to go with what's best for the students.
A pass.
You didn't have to kill Sophie.
Fuck Bastaldi and his brother. These tapes are gold. Do you have any idea what Zammito would pay to get them back?
Thank you Marcel, for that... extremely redundant explanation.
A million! I don't have that kind of money.
You sure? I just got a shipment of espresso from Sicily. Special blend. Can't find anything like it in the States.
Then why not just fuckin' say better than expected? Everybody knows what better than expected means.
Okay.   How much?
Business must be good if he can afford to buy up useless property.
They're gonna be what?
You rob an associate of mine... a friend and--
I don't know.
Not a good idea. Someone gets a license number and it all leads back to you. Raymond, you'll steal one.
Raymond, grab the tapes.    We're leaving!
Bastaldi's dead. He is fuckin' dead!
I bought everything you put on the list. Gloves. Pen knives. Flashlight. Batteries were not on the list.
That's an excellent plan.     Very comforting.
Besides, we don't know the city and--
The deal is whatever Mr. Bastaldi says it is.
It's not your fault, Daniel.
Okay. Airports, train stations, bus station are out. We know they're connected to the car rental agencies because that's where they picked up Raymond.
Anybody hungry?
Does it really matter what I say?
Yeah. All set. Tomorrow morning. Ten o'clock. Room 211. Barclay Hotel on River Street. Oh, and due to your recent notoriety and the heat that comes with it, I'm going to have to increase my brokerage fee to twenty five hundred.
There's ten grand in here. It's yours. I'm going to call you again. There's one more thing I need you to do.
Okay, we're square now, right?
Maybe you should call the police.
-- you stole my cousin Enrique's car.
Everything.
Yeah. I'll come down and make a full confession later. Right now, tell me what else you found?
The map said to go left.
What about transportation?
Yes.
No wonder Zammito didn't want us to walk out with this stuff. He's planning on killing Bonanno and taking over the family.
I knew this was a mistake! I knew it last night when you asked me to go along with this. I could hear that little voice in my head saying, "don't do it! Don't you do it!" Jesus, why don't I ever listen to myself?
This is bad. This is really fuckin' bad. Am I the only one who sees how bad this is?
I knew I should have driven.
Normally I'd be breaking your fingers right now, but I'm going to give you a chance to make enough to pay me back and have some extra for yourself. We have a group going to Chicago to do a job. You're going with them.
Why would they want us to rob the Mafia?
Who is closer to the wall, Joey or me?
What happened?
Fuck you, grease-ball!
Oh, Pepe Le Pew. He is very funny and quite well known in France.
I'm glad you didn't get something flashy.
Holy shit.
The money isn't here.
The new Beaujolais' come out in France next week. You like wine?
I can't even hear myself think.
It has to be at Sophie's. She didn't have time to go anywhere else before she came here.
And how do we do that?
When do we go?
It looks old.     Did you get it a long time ago?
Who's gonna see it there?
She seems pleasant enough.
I don't want anything. I just wanted to say... that I may have... overreacted a little the other day.
Yeah. I mean, you are my brother and... well I should have found another way of expressing my disappointment. So, I've decided to make it up to you.
I'm looking for someone.  Jade Fox. I'm a police inspector from Shaan Xi, Gen Su district.  Jade Fox is a master criminal.  I hear she infiltrated the Yus.  She must have come with them when they transferred here.  But with Yu's reputation, I can't just go in and accuse her.
Where's your master?
My name is Li Mu Bai.  The Green Destiny is mine.  Jade Fox can't be your master.  Where did you learn that "Xuan Piu" move?
They wouldn't have found me if you hadn't stolen the sword.  Like a little girl, you thought stealing would be fun?  You, too, are responsible for that death.  Come with me.  You don't want to waste your life as the wife of some bureaucrat.  Denied your talent... As a master and disciple we will rule.
Wherever we want.  We'll get rid of anyone in our way.  Even your father.
I'll socialize with whomever I please.
It will be just the same.  Enough! I'm tired.
I've read all about people like you. Roaming wild, beating up anyone who gets in your way!
You're not married, are you?
You're doing calligraphy?
Please.
Too bad for Meng, but it's not your fault, or Li Mu Bai's.
You, sister...
They forced me to marry!
Don't touch it!  That's Li Mu Bai's sword.
Lo?
I don't take orders from anyone.
Don't send me back!
Do you remember the legend of the young man?
Why?  You're a Wudan fighter. Training is everything.
We're preparing a convoy for a delivery to Peking.
I don't understand.  How can you part with it?  It has always been with you.
Jade Fox?  Impossible.
I didn't think she'd dare come back to Peking!
No, not yet...
No, I'd already sent them home. You can blame me for losing the sword, but please trust that I'll get it back soon using my own methods.
True.  But I must borrow it for one last mission.  Jade Fox must die at its edge.  Did you know what you were hiding when you covered for that girl?
For her, they might make an exception.  If not, I'm afraid she'll become a poisoned dragon.
I thought by giving away the sword, I could escape the Giang Hu world. But the cycle of bloodshed continues.
I'll look around and catch up later.
Maybe the murderer and the thief are one and the same.
I don't know...
But the sword could be in his compound.
Sir Te, can you find some excuse to invite Madam Yu and her daughter?
Sure it coulda.  Funboy's not here, neither is T-Bird -- none of Top Dollar's number ones.
Talent. Hi.
You died, man.  I can't believe it but here you are.  Last year, you and your girlfriend --
Thank you.  For giving a damn.
It's done. ALBRECHT I figured as much.  Did you cap off Funboy.
My mom works over there.  I'm waiting for her, but she's probably with him, right now.
Well, how's your friend?
Little early from trick-or-treat, homie.  This dick trying to bushwack me.
A year ago.  Halloween.  A man and a woman.  In a loft.  You helped to murder them.
You cut her.  You raped her.  You watched!
Top Dollar.
Like the car.  He hangs out with Skank. that little ass-hair, and they hang at the Pit -- hell, Funboy lives there.  Ask Top Dollar.
Miss her?
Glad to see you're finally with the program.
You need to learn to mind your own business or you'll never get where you think you're going.
Don't waste my time.
What... the hell is that?
Mmm.  But tonight I can take what is his.
We've got company.
I had heard something like this.  Describe it for me.  The "hit".
You a lesbo?
I read your teen beat manifesto.
Well maybe you should get to know the person before you judge them instead of listening to some bullshit gossip.
Look, I know this is your house and all, but do you think you couid keep it down? I'm trying to read.
This is my favorite part.  Even more treacherous and dangerous than he is charming and fascinating. He has never taken a single step or spoken a single word without some dishonorable or criminal intention. Every young girl he has successfully pursued has regretted it.
The last thing I need is you going into my room searching for this while I'm away.
Look, I didn't mean to give you a hard time.
Do you deny that there's an attraction between us?
Oh right, last night. I guess I owe you an apology.
I'm sorry, but I'm not here to be your savior.
I can't. I'm seeing a friend.
That's also none of your business.
Okay?
Need any company?
My friend Monsieur Philipe is a friend of Florentino.
Then what's wrong? I love you Annette. It's not like you have a husband, unless your married to Jesus.
How am I a hypocrite?
Hi.
My Grandpa, used to breed horses on his farm so I would come over and ride all the time.
Are you shitting me?
Well, I guess it's getting late. Please thank Kathryn for the use of her Steinway.
Where did you find those?
I'll call you later and we'll get together and plan your curriculum.
So, rumor has it that you went on a date with Court Reynolds. I hear he's very nice.
What are you scared of?
Haven't you ever practiced with one of your girlfriends?
Let's try it again, only this time I'm going to stick my tongue in your mouth. When I do that I want you to massage my tongue with yours. That's what first base is.
Listen to me. Your mother must never know. Never.
Did you hide the letters?
Cecile if there's one thing I'm great at it's love letters. With my help, he'll be eating out of the palm of your hand. Perhaps we can arrange a little get together for the two of you at my house.
I'm so proud of you. You're becoming a woman.
Now listen. Now that you're on your way, it would be stupid of you to stop. Think of Sebastian as a tutor. Let him instruct you.
So? Don't you want to make Ronald a happy pappy? Practice makes perfect, Cecile. My advice is to sleep with as many people as possible.
It's like a secret society.
What are you doing?
Please please please. I'll do anything. Just don't call my mom.
Need any company?
But you said you have the worst reputation.
My daughter, Rachel.
Don't even think about it. Rachel is an exceptionally well rounded young woman, who happens to be attending Princeton this fall. She's way too smart to fall for your line of b.s.
Oh baby... oh baby...
Greg, is that you under the covers?
-- really drunk and blah blah blah blah blah.
Annette Harrison? I don't know what you're talking about.
I'm pretty sure she did.
Is she with you?
Where is she?!
What do you do? Tell her you love her.
Hello.
I'd be careful if I were you. God knows what he's up to.
What are the terms?
I'll give you something you've been jerking off about ever since our parents got married.
In English.  I'll fuck your brains out.
You can put it anywhere.
Call me later.
Who are you calling?
Who are you spying on?
Nothing.
Exactly the opposite.
You didn't?
At first it was, but now it's become something bigger.
That's not fair. You're taking all the fun out of it.
Why so nervous?
A little melodramatic, don't you think.
I can't tell you how happy we are that Cecile is going to be attending Oakwood with you this fall. You've always been an inspiration to Beau and I on raising her. We just hope she can rise to the high standards which you've set for her.
Don't worry, it's totally understandable. Most of the boys that matriculate at Oakwood are very upstanding gentleman, however there are the occasional bad apples.
Not at all. What's wrong?
I'm paying you to give cello lessons. Not to pervert my child.
What do you want?
She's out.
Young man, I already told you she's not here.
I understand. Thanks for letting me crash here.
Did you hit her?
But Edward, in this kind of a wish that doesn't matter.
What are saying, darling?
Did your wishes ever come true?
Where did you get this ring?
You mustn't tell anybody, or it won't come true.
She was very pretty.
Oh, thank you, darling.
No.  It's not that.  It's because I know what can happen when people begin to lie to themselves -- imagine things. I love Amy too much to let her lose herself in a dream world where butterflies become pals. I saw what happened to Irena with her Cat People.
Why don't you take off your hat and stay awhile?
It's your play.
I haven't had my breakfast.
Some day I'm afraid we're going to have to tell her about Irena.
Certain wishes do.
What do you want. Amy?
Now Amy
And who did the voice belong to?
My goodness, don't you open your presents until Christmas morning?
We open ours on Christmas Eve. That's considered proper.
Who are you?
Merry Christmas, Irena.  I brought you a present.
It stands so still.
I can sea its breath in the cold.
A ring that I can wish on like I wished on the candles?
Well, if it's a real mourning ring,. I'm going to think hard for something I want more than anything else in the world before I wish.
You're going to be busy all day long, Edward.
Mustn't look, little miss. Mustn't look.
But I only came to give back the ring.
Who's Herne the Huntsman?
But I am Barbara. I didn't die.
Promise me you won't forget tomorrow. You'll remember, won't you? You won't say that it was just a dream. Promise me.
It all starts with them going to the bathroom together.
I'm lucky Jen's not like that.
No one I've run into knows what "coyote ugly" means.
Sorry I didn't recognize you earlier. You look so different.
And keep a journal of your symptoms to make sure it's related to your period and not just in your head.
You haven't mentioned dating anyone since Mark and, well you're not a lesbian are you?
I guess I have a weakness for him. It's those big brown Bambi eyes.
He hasn't said one word to me.
My date always pays more attention to you than to me.
How about I give you a make-over? You'll feel better about yourself. You're actually pretty, you're just not bringing it out.
Or if there's a full moon.
I think she broke the skin.
I don't see anything. Maybe just a little.
Did you get smashed or what? You have to eat if you're drinking. And not just those little salads.
At least your PMS is over.
I wonder if he's married.
Why didn't you tell me? You said you hadn't seen him for a month.
What did he say?
You're delusional. Maybe you had a bad dream and bit your lip -- so you tasted blood. And the severed arm... well I don't see it and... maybe this is all in your head.
Maybe the blood was from your period like before.
Frida, listen to yourself. If I said I was a werewolf, would you believe me?
Oh no.
There's kind of this guy I'm seeing.
Why the fuck would you do that?
The weird thing is... he shot her with a silver bullet.
What choice do we have?
Fall in love.
I'm just afraid I'll hurt Peter. I think I love him.
I think George knows.
About Benito.
I know.
I do development for TV movies.
I'm really tired.
Uh huh. So pee.
Look what you did!
Shit. And you're eating my burger? You don't eat meat.
Frida? I hear you talking. I know you're in there. Let me in.
Mark.
The Nielson's?
You busted me.
No... no... this is embarrassing. I was returning your pillowcase... and I saw you cross the street... and I sort of started following you. I just find you really intriguing. I don't know why.
I've had time to get over it. She was killed by wolves they think.
I really gotta get going.
What are they for?
What's wrong?
Was there anything in that washer?
You sure? It's my favorite shirt, mind if I check?
What happened?
That's it? Hell my mom chased my dad around with a knife when she had it. She made us call her a different name. She'd say, "You're talking to Betty now" and we'd leave the house for a few days.
Is that how you feel?
Yes, sort of. I mean no, not really.
I knew you wouldn't kill me.
Dreams about killing usually signify feelings of guilt. You had sex last night and you feel guilty.
No he's not. He's a courier. He picks up packages from the airport.
So I asked the bartender what "coyote ugly" meant. It's like the "bagger" system. You know, a two- bagger -- someone so ugly that you need two bags -- one bag to put on their head and another one in case it blows off. Or a three-bagger...
She's just insecure. Once you get to know her she's fabulous.
It's for you. Frida.
Jesus Christ she got her period. Relax guys. It happens.
Nah, I don't wanna break up with Wanda, I just wanna see Carmen too.
I didn't trust her. All that blood on the sheets. She may look sweet, but she could be a wolf in sheep's clothing. Something's weird.
No man. Blood is not a turn on. You sure let that Frida off the hook. You weren't even going to take the sheets. If I didn't know better, I'd think you liked her.
Frida's sheets checked out fine. It was just her own blood. From her... you know.
This is more than fishy, this chick dates a dude and he winds up dead.
She's got a hidden pitbull. Maybe she hired someone to kill them.
It's like some fucking monster dropped out of the sky and killed these dudes.
It has to be Frida. This makes three guys ripped apart who are tied to her ass.
What are you talking about?
Sell maps?
Police.  Nobody move.
That's surprising.  He was leaving your office at the time...
Good evening, sir.
Why are you wearing that thing on your face?
Why do you want to speak to him?
Who is it?
Where are we going?
Is that your idea of a joke?  I don't remember...  Take my advice, Bumstead.  Get off this case.  Now.
Jesus!  We have to get you to a doctor...
Which one?
Such a joker!  Like your father.
You see it?
A fanciful idea, Mister White.
Known me for long?
I'm sorry.  About before.
If you would only take this, inject it in your brain, everything would be much clearer.
I thought it would make more sense. I'm getting the pieces, but when I put it together it feels like... Like you're telling me about somebody else's life...
I'm not certain about...
What the hell is this?
The Washington Post.
That shelter was in this bill.
You're lint!  You're a flea!  You're a blip!
... what?
Oh... I'm fired?
They say it hit both sides of his brain... Even if he makes it he's gonna be a vegetable.
A condition...
Her?... Oh -- the First Lady...  She was giving that commencement speech up in Bryn Mawr.  I managed to catch her before she left the hotel.
What about the wife?
Nobody's got clean kids.
What are you gonna do?
It's not his job -- It's my job!
Uh-oh...
Oh yeah... Me, too.  You want to get dinner later?
And who's gonna find out?
You sure?  A Coke or a Perrier or something?
Oh my God...
It's actually kind of serious, Dave. I'm afraid the President's not in very good shape.
Will he be alright?
Well,  let's say your mother was in the car and you had to get her to a hospital.  You'd do it then for sure wouldn't you?
The teleprompter.  Is it hooked up?
Dave, the budget's a very complicated thing.  Even I don't understand it sometimes.  Now occasionally we have to make some cuts and...
No,  sir.  It's more of a perceptual issue.
Well... to shore up product identification and preserve market share.
... Sometimes they do.
Oh my God...  I thought it was a legitimate deduction, I swear to God. See... I need a piano for my work sometimes...
Really?
I was waiting for that jack.
Don't you have anything to say to me?
That's not just a works bill you vetoed -- that would have given these kids homes...  ... When I think about that little spectacle you pulled with those muppets and that magic trick...
Look.  If there was some mistake...
I mean, what is it?  Another Secretary? A jaunt to the Bahamas with Some 'campaign worker.'  Where is he?
How were you gonna get home?
You sure this goes somewhere?
You don't have to keep walking with me.   I'm okay from here.
He said he'll pick it up in a couple of days.
What?
Yes.
What?
Hi.
I wish I had better news... Our compassion index is off seven points from the last sample and that's down eighteen on the year.  The `Cares About People Like Me' numbers are really in the toilet.  We're off twenty points from March and that was right after we raised interest rates...
We're all set,  sir.
Oh yeah.  Did you take care of later on?
I don't believe you, rebel. Where are your headquarters? On the mainland?
Sir. It's quite clear that...
Tonight?
Curse?
It's a disease. It's a...a bug...a parasite that infects the brain.
We thought we were escaping here. We thought we'd found an uninhabited island. Christ! This place is a worse nightmare than anything I've seen yet!
Look. I BEEN fightin', mister. I been fightin' for what feels like a hundred years and I'm finished. I don't need religion. I don't need prayers. I need a couple guns and a couple hands. We can sail on outa here. Find another island where there ain't so much....traffic.
Datura! Miguel knew it! Datura, he was shouting! Datura Metel!
I'm gonna have this stuff sent over to the hospital...
There ya go. Complete with air canisters...little motors.
Oh, no. I'm tryin' to get off this island alive. I'll help you all I can but I'm not goin' in there on a suicide mission. What can you hope to accomplish? Some radios maybe? A supply room or two? You'll all be killed and in a few weeks they'll be back to business as usual. That place was built to withstand nuclear attack! What are you gonna do with a half-dozen guns and a few sticks of nitro?
What?
He is dying. He knows it.
God has damned us all. Are my atrocities worse than yours?
You gave them a fresh taste of blood!
I want you to leave. Then maybe...
I am not...a guerilla fighter, Toby. I'm not a pioneer. I'm not...I'm not strong that way. I need...
No time for that. I'll take care of them.
Step up here, Tyler.
It's been fired.
What'dya get?
No relation.  Never heard of him. Sorry.
All I'm saying is we have to be careful. We can't get caught.
Charlie Dalton.
God, I can't take it anymore!  If I don't have Chris, I'll kill myself.
Yaa, I'm a dead poet!
I here and now commit myself to daring!
You're siding with Mr. Nolan?!  What about carpe diem and sucking all the marrow out of life and all that?
Yes sir.
It's such a strange name!  Won't you tell us what it means?
Yeah!    Don't you guys miss having girls here?
Every guy that I meet wants me for one thing my body.  You're not like that.
Hey, I heard you went to summer school?
I don't know about anyone else, but I could use a refresher in Latin.  Eight o'clock in my room?
Charlie, That was great!  Where did you learn to play like that?
Where'd you find them?
You what?!  How did you do that?
What happened? Were you kicked out?
What are you doing?!
So, uh, where are you in school?
carpe breastum.  Seize the breast.
Of course just like that.  That's how you always know when it's right.
Chet?  To a play? Are you kidding?
We thought it would be good to break old habits, sir.
Yes sir.
John, the curriculum here is set.  It's proven.  It works.  If you question it, what's to prevent them from doing the same?
Now there's the poet speaking!  Close your eyes and think of the picture. Describe what you see.  NOW!
A sweaty-toothed madman
Stretch it, pull it, it will never cover any of us.  Kick at it, beat at it, it will never be enough-
I certainly wouldn't lose any sleep over it.  It's just a bunch of people trying to impress Nolan.
If you have built castles in the air, your work need not be lost.  That is where they should be.  Now put foundations under them.
Look at this.
Why'd you leave Balincrest?
So what do you think of my father?
I know that.  What's it got to do with you?
Won't he kill you if you don't let him know you're auditioning?
By the way, there's a meeting this afternoon.  You coming?
Being in the club means being stirred up by things.  You look about as stirred up as a cesspool.
Er  No.
Todd, what's the matter?
I mean, this is one special gift!  Who would want a football or a baseball bat or a car when they could get a desk set as wonderful as this one!
Lots of girls.  The girl who plays Hermia is incredible.
How do we get out of here?
We don't even know if his boat is still there...you saw Billy!
And what? These things are octopusses?
No, it just struck me as odd...I don't see you for all these years and you've still got the same tape stuck in the box.
Right here...middle of nowhere...and the answer to your question is yes.
This isn't right Finnegan. I've got a contract.
Where are my men?
I'm not a thief.
Unless you collected on the insurance...
I was born in a City housing project in the Bronx OK? It's not in the cards that I die on a luxury cruise ship...now which way up?
Hey! Hey! Where are you going?
What's that supposed to mean? You people.
So this boat of yours...that's what you do? Give people...rides.
Seen a lot of islands?
Since I'm a kid, I had this dream... I want to own my own tropical island... Beaches, warm ocean, lots of food, little clothes...population of one...
What's the matter?
There's not much horsepower left in the engines, but there's enough noise...once this baby's set...I'll rev it up...that slimy bastard will come for it like candy...
You want ME to go up there?
So...If the hull's impregnable why are my feet wet?
...Jagger was here...I was here...
Sure I do...I give a shit that at 0300 hour we reach our point of dentination. I give a shit that those mojos got to do what they got to do, and 45 minutes later we are turn around and gone. I give a shit that by the time the sun comes up we are all safely tucked in bed.
It's okay...come on...
All you're gonna do is get yourself killed...and for what? Some chick?
I thought the plan was we'd evacuate them after we got through.
What was that?
She fucked you?
Fucking women, man...
Nick's going?
Sweet! Oh, that is sweet!
Damn right!
Ammo! Get the ammo!
It's gotta be the next one. I mean it's gotta be! Right, Albert?
Where the hell were you? We were all set -- beer, broads. Right? Am I right?
Hey, Nick, I mean... This here is for the guy that gets caught!
Then what's the gun for! What's this for?
That's new, isn't it?
I got delayed. I --
I'm glad. Seriously... I'm very glad.
Sure. Why not.
Nick... Sal is very weak. He suffered a severe wound... and right now he doesn't want a whole lot of people to get involved in a whole thing.
I have to go.
Yeah... Do you mind if I sit?
C'est tres amusant... You have been promoted. And to a Jew... I am joking of course. Naturellement. Seriously, Nick, may I hope that you have come to play?
That's right. That's exactly what I mean!
She's in back.
How was huntin'?
Merle? That's who we're looking for. Merle.
Sure! I got eight hundred potatoes says he goes one more... He retired, you know.
Look at that, see... Watch. Wait a minute, watch. There! D'j'u see that? D'j'u see the way he... You know what that guy is doing? That guy is squeezing her ass!
Holy shit!
But Sal's mother! What about Sal's mother!
You Biederman?
What?
I thought... Oh, Nick, I thought you were hurt, some accident. Maybe you fell or maybe some car...  I thought someone stole you away!
How's the trailer?
Mais certainment... A great deal of money. Naturally I do not do it myself. I myself do not possess the nerve.  But I am always... how do you say... looking out for those who do... It is a thing quite rare. Champagne perhaps? Tch, tch. Don't say no. When a man says no to champagne, he says no to life and that no man must ever do.  Where did you play?
Won't we? Right? Am I right?
I just wait. You know?
Fucking A.
Pow?
I love this fuckin' place... That sounds crazy. I know that sounds crazy, but I love this fuckin' place... If anything happens, Nick, don't leave me there. I mean it. Don't leave me... You gotta promise, Nick. You gotta promise me that.
Promise! You gotta promise!
We gotta play with more bullets, Nick. It's the only way.
I did. I... This is stolen. I came back.
Here, here! This is it!
You're one fuckin' bastard, Merle. You know that? You're one fucking bastard!
Great. That's great.
What's that noise?
Sal, we need you. We need you.
Maybe you could use socks, Nick. Jesus, I mean, come to think of it socks are pretty expensive now.
I saw him last night. I thought I was dreaming. I thought I was out of my mind.
It's okay. Hey, it's okay! Just a week. Just to see Phantom Mary.
Well... Phantom Mary's on my mother's side. Naturally no one there admits it because Phantom Mary's pretty weird... You want to hear the whole story?
What the hell's that for?
Oh, Jesus!  You're kiddin'!
What the hell was that!  What did you think? Did you think it was loaded!
Up I would say... What would you say?
Looks like ya gonna take office just in time, Chief.  Things need straightening up in this city.
Witnesses say some wacko went Judge hunting with a late model.  I got an artist working on a computer composite now.
Talk fast.  Polls open in half an hour.
I think he wants more than your cookies.
Speak up.
Looks like you did more than jackoff while I was gone.
I want to see my wife and kid.
I told you.  I'm out of the cops and robbers business.  Retired twenty years ago.  I've been trained as a bus driver.  Got a whole route planned and everything.  Even nailed down the lingo - '<u>Exact change, please</u>'.
What's this?
Give it to me.
You're working a partner on this.
Hello Wade.
You can't kill me.  I'm going to be Mayor tomorrow.
Don't threaten me.  I tend to take these things seriously.  And get a couple hours sleep.  You look like day old shit.
Just got the call.  Took him from school.  Bastard nailed the Vice- Principal and a teacher.
I'm wasting time.
What is it?  I'm about to go on.
Kill him... kill him.
Sir, your transmission's fading.
You're saying you were put away for a crime you didn't commit?
No.  Talk English.  Then I'll understand.
Maybe I should turn myself in.
Wanna try?
Rip Van Winkle.
William Simpson.  I like Willy.
We'll cook 'em ourselves. You'll help me, Belle.
What are those people doing there? What do they want?
Belle --
And two unpara-- unparalleled Cir-cass-ian beauties? What is that?
Daniel! Don't ever let me catch you doing that again!
Make them go faster, Mr.... ?
But it didn't stop. I know it didn't stop. Granny told me it didn't.
Daniel give me that beanshooter!
I don't want to be up there all alone, Mama.... I want to be with you.
Sure does. But I'll have to sleep on it a couple of nights.
I am just thinkin' -- now they mightn't like the idea down in Washington.
-- in gold.
Good evening -- I'm sorry, Jabez -- I'm a little late.
It's mine?
No, no! Give it to me!
Excellent. A firm, fair signature. One that will last till doomsday.  My dear Neighbor Stone, I congratulate you! You're going to be the richest man in New Hampshire! 
Yes, indeed. But not now. Not for seven years. Oh, I almost forgot -- what is the date?
Good evening, Neighbor Stone.
Why, Mr. Stone, you look so worried. Can I be of any service?
Oh no, you violated clause five of our contract and I could collect right now, if I chose.
Well now, Mr. Stone, did you make up your mind?
Here's a man who knows what's good for Dan'l Webster! Medford rum! Ah, a breath of the Promised Land!  To the champion of the Iron Horseshoe, Jabez Stone!
Eloquent speech, Neighbor Stone -- couldn't have done better myself --  -- under the circumstances.  Thank you.
Well -- Mr. Webster! This is a great day for me. Come on in, sir. I want you to take the seat of honor and meet all my guests!
There's nothing like it. I saw an inchworm take a drop of it once, and he stood right up on his hind legs and bit a bee. Come -- try a nip!
Ma says breakfast's ready, Mr. Webster!
Why -- good morning, Squire.
Yes.
The only one you missed -- is the President.
You keep that -- that's for you. I want you to talk up the party to make sure that the best folks really come.
Yes  siree -- that's the idea. Get them all here and then say: "Look, folks -- here's Daniel Webster, my guest of honor." Golly, I can see their eyes pop already.
He's stubborn as a Stone.
Mary, I'm a farmer -- always will be. To me seed isn't a thing to pay debts with, it's alive, more alive than anything -- but I guess you're right. We just got to do it. Oh -- how's it all going to end?
Mary -- what would you do with a pot o' gold?
There's hope and promise in it, Jabez -- Planting and promise of good harvest to come.
That's one thing I want to talk to you about, Mary.
But it's not very becoming to you to have your hands in the suds -- when the Squire and his wife --
Well -- that's the last time -- we'll have servants to do it.
Mary! Come back ...
Most outlandish thing I ever heard tell.  Don't seem right, somehow!
Well -- that's comforting!  Supper.
Well, son, I'm glad to see a Stone come up in the world again.
Queer sort of weather we're having -- queer like everything else.
Do you really think that?
Golly, Ma --  Consarn that music! Shouldn't a-had the harvest festival tonight.
You know, Ma, why the Squire came to see Jabez?
What a nice -- and kind girl --  Who is she --?
Me? Why, look here, Mary Stone -- I'm worried about you, that's all.
What's that?
You don't have to defend him to me, Mary -- I've been called names myself.
There is nothing like a good old country breakfast. Where's Ma?
Someone to see you, Dan'l!
Just someone from New Hampshire!
Mr. Webster, I presume?
'Cause I'm a New York cop who used to be a New York kid, and I got six months backlog of New York scumbags I'm still trying to put behind bars. I don't just get up and move.
I'm Special Agent Johnson of the FBI. This is Agent Johnson...no relation.
What's happening?
John, I think you could get with the program a little.  The police are here now.  It's their problem. Tell these guys where the detonators are so no one else gets hurt.  Hey, I'm putting my life on the line for you buddy...
Hans, he killed by brother --
It's beautiful.  I always enjoyed models as a boy.  The exactness, the attention to every foreseeable detail... perfection.
Mr. Mystery Guest.  Are you still there?
I'm afraid not.  But you have me at a loss -- you know my name, but who are you?  Just another American who saw too many movies as a child.  Another orphan of a bankrupt culture who thinks he's John Wayne...Rambo... Marshal Dillion.
Hear that?  Talk to me, where are my detonators.  Where are they or shall I shoot another one?  Sooner or later...  ...I might get to someone you do care about.
--ohGodplease -- don't kill me -- don't kill me -- you're one of them, I know it --
New York...
That was tricky, with the accent. I bet you do a great Ed Sullivan. Why do you need the detonators, Hans? I already used the explosives.
Three down, four to go --
I...have a request.
Well, Cappy Roberts retired out here a couple years ago.  He said I could bunk with him.
Yeah.  How'd you know?
'Roy'.
Hey, I love you.  So do a lot of the guys.  So hang in there, man.  Hang in there.
Al?  Al, you there?
Al.  Man, you were my rock.  I couldn't have made it without you.
Is that him?
These seats come out?
I was lookin' at it.  I saw you, man!  Jesus!  You oughta see yourself!  You wouldn't believe it.
Aw, hey...
Maybe we can take something smaller... like a Spanish grocery.
Hey, don't take the car!
What guns?
I'll kiss the baby for you.
Jesus Christ is coming back and he's really pissed.
Yeah, well...maybe you better talk to one of these others, okay?
Yeah.  You said... I thought you were never getting out?
Fine, thank you.  I'm in trouble. That is... now I am!
What are you talking about?
I don't know what I'm doing.
I'm not on the phone to talk to you about that.  Well, I don't know what to say, Leon.  When you gimme that... when you hit me with that shit.  I mean, what am I supposed to say?
I told you.  That I got a lot of pressures.  You said to me that you needed money, and I knew that you needed money!  I saw you there lying in the hospital like that... and I said... shit, man, I got to get this guy some money.
I'm getting out of here, man.  I'm not going to stay here and I'm not giving up.  I mean, huh, they're going to kill me, anyway.  So fuck it!  But, if I can get out of this... I am going to get out. And, how I'm going to do it is to get a jet out of here and I'm flying the fuck out... That's all, Leon.  If you want to come with me, then you're entitled... you can come.  You're free to do what you want.
What am I supposed to do?
Look... don't throw that on me.
Yeah... yeah!
It's my only chance!
You try calling the police?
He's makin' threats in there.
He needed money?  For the operation for you?
You're in it up to your ass, Leon. You're an accessory.  You talk him out of there and they might be a little more understanding of your case.
How many you got in there?
Okay, Sonny, I want to see if the people in the bank are okay, then what I want to do is work out a way to get them out of there.  I want to come over there, without a gun ... and you can frisk me.  So you can see you can trust me.  So we can talk and find a way outta this mess.
How about letting the people out of the bank.  Why put them in this position?
You're all one way!  I'm bein' reasonable with you; give me somethin' ... Give me one of them, anyway ... Just one ...
You got these cops outta here. They're comin' in too close.
Let Sal come out, take a look. What hope you got?  Quit while you're ahead.  All you got is attempted robbery.
He wanted to kill me!
Okay, what do you give me?
You know, you're telling me that a helicopter can't land here ...
Don't fuck with me ...
Yeah?
What's the matter with you?
This is it?  What am I gonna do with this?  Holy shit!
The gun's right on your back...
Hello, Mulvaney here...
Where's the back door?
Now, you -- what's your name?
To what ... learn how to shoot? They don't get a gun.
What if I take you with me?
What?
Do you think we can turn it on?
Are we going to get the ball rolling?
You like me?
I wish somebody would tell me I'm gonna live long enough for it to be a habit.  My parent, she'll be okay. My husband, he'll be okay.  I even know who the bum is gonna marry. Terrific.  She'll take good care of him.
Did you always call him Junior.
You shouldn't start now.
You're really pure, you know?  You got a perfect record.  You never used that stuff to ruin your body, why start now?
You mean that?
We won't have to.
I figure maybe we can get the FBI to make a deal ...
There it is, Sal.  Sal?
Hey, Sonny - You did it!
Bullshit!
My kids ... Kimmy and Jimmy.
Here's your document, Sonny.
You did what?  Who did you talk to? What for?
Oh my God, mother!
We can't stay here.
For God's sake don't start in on Heidi again ...
She doesn't have anything to do with it!  You understand that? Mother?  This is me!
Not now, Mom, please.
The audience is interested in you, Sonny ... not me.
What happened to my money, Mr. Williams? <b> INT. CLAREMONT WILLIAMS III BOND AGENCY -- NEXT </b> Claremont sits behind his desk with his phone to his ear.

Fella takes out two kids and has the audacity to not show up for trial.
Fella could get used to a life this ordinary.
Promise me... you won't ever tell Domino.
Hello?
Why the hell are we delivering them out here? I can't even find any warrants in the system for these four.
Okay.
She's right... you lost your temper... and you started cursing like some ghetto skank. You lost all credibility right there!
You motherfuckin' Tino. You fucked us so bad.
Claremont, you're a chubby chaser.
<i>Did you get all four?</i>
Ms. Harvey... my name is Taryn Miles. I'm a criminal psychologist working for the FBI. I'm here to ask you a few questions.
<i>You drove Lateesha's daughter to school... then dropped her off at the DMV. Why?</i>
Is that the decoder?

Meeka's white blood cell count is dropping fast.
You almost knocked me down.  The word is "excuse me."
I'm gonna leave now.
What did he do this time?
Buggin' Out, I don't mean to be disrespectful, but you can really direct your energies in a more useful way.
How much?
Mookie.
You the man.
It's so nice to see a family hanging out together.
As I was saying before we were so rudely interrupted by the finest.
Make it plain.
Squash it.
Doctor, always try to do the right thing.
My name is Eddie.
Jade.
Is this another one of your patented two-hour lunches?
You should see the way he looks at you.  All Sal wants to do is hide the salami.
That's why I don't fool with it. Only let you touch it...Ouch!
Here ya are.  Keep the change.
Mookie, no cursing in the store.
Sal, if you want me to deliver any faster, get me a jet rocket or something, cuz I can't run with pizzas, all the cheese ends up on one side and shit.
C'mon, Sal.
Mookie, I always liked you.  Not the smartest kid, but you're honest. Don't make me dislike you.
Do we now?
No.  What are you gonna do?
Doctor, this is Sal talkin'.
I know I haven't seen you in four days.  I'm a working man.
Before I get off work.
Tina, you are too slick.
No!  No!  You won't come back either.
I'm gonna take off ya clothes.
Why you gotta curse?
Mookie, late again.  How many times I gotta tell you?
Just coolin'.
Pino, I think secretly that you wish you were Black.  That's what I think.  Vito, what do you say?
That's what you think?
Whaddup.  Money?
I love you, my brother.
Jesus Christ on the cross, I said I'm listening.
Pino, get a broom and sweep out front.
Sal's Famous Pizzeria, yeah, two large pizzas, pepperoni and anchovies, hold on...  See, Pop, Mookie fucking talking on the phone and people are trying to call in orders.  He's making us lose business.
Then we could try something else.
Pop, stop lying.
No, I'm not it.
Oh, yeah. I don't think they do. You're new here, right?
I've been assigned to write an article about you for the school paper. It was either a feature on you or the new four-color ink pens at the student store.
Yeah, well, I'd much rather write an expose or a hard hitting investigative piece, but nothing really ever happens around here. But, I chose you and that's fine.  I'm Jessica Matthews.
Hey guys.
Do you thill want to do an arwticle on me, Jethica?
Tomorrow we go on a fee-eee-eee- wald twrip.
Excuse me?
Just down the hall.
Why didn't you tell us your boyfriend was Principal Collins?
You're going to be just fine, HARRY.
Oh, Harry, I'm so proud of you making a real friend.
No thanks, not hungry. Harry Dunne. Why does that name not sound familiar?
I think it's just over there.
My mom says the treasure's somewhere in the school.
Yeah, dangerous cult. Don't make eye contact or they might talk to you.
No no no no no.
God, she's beautiful. My wiener's all tingly.
One day they'll find a cure.
That would be me, sir. The wife made stew last night.
Nice jugs.
Can he do that?
These are really cold, huh?
Nope. I was right.
Oh yeah, buddy, you're gonna get "some".
You know... She's gonna be all over you like a barrel of monkeys, with her tight shirt and short skirt... Eeeww, it's so faggy I can't even talk about it.
I don't think so.
LLOYD, what are you doing? That's JESSICA and... my mom.
Did you hear what I said? The treasure! Like on your map!
Wow, we built a whole float in one afternoon. And now the reward.
It's okay. I want the rush.
PRINCIPAL COLLINS is her boyfriend!
Hey, look. Ice cream.
You found my treasure? Why didn't you tell me.
Well, I'm listening now.
You know Lloyd, the real treasure is our friendship.
That makes total sense. The treasure chest was in his office. Which means Principal Collins is a pirate! I'm surprised Captain Rob never mentioned him.
That's what Jessica was talking about!
Ya know Harry, I think this whole experience has soured me on women.
What?
Beats me. It's Jessica's Dad - she said he's really anal.
So, when can we do it?
Don't worry about me, I'll be fine. I can take care of myself and I'm getting the story every high school reporter dreams of.
Sure.
Okay.
Senior year. My little boy. Who woulda thunk it?  You're a good kid, Lloyd. I don't say it enough, but I'm proud of you son.
My boy's special, well how about that. I knew you were different.
What?
Well you know Detective, he's expecting  'Moffit' to be someone who has... certain... well...
... and, Principal Collins, you'll be pleased to know that this year Wednesdays are "South of the Border" days. We'll serve a spicy tuna tamale along with a cheese quesadilla.
Knock knock.
You got the Extender?
I sold all the wind instruments.  Hawaiian Air, business class. And you like that new fur coat?
This is horse?
He wishes to inform you that Vendetta -- as he puts it, using the ancient tongue, the art of Kanly -- is still alive. He does not wish to meet or speak with you.
My thanks.
I shall want telepathy during his visit and a report when we're finished.
I see two Great Houses -- House Atreides, House Harkonnen -- feuding... I see you behind it.
You must share with us. -- EMPEROR The Atreides house is building a secret army!... using a technique unknown to us... a technique involving sound. The Duke is becoming more popular in the Landsraad... he could threaten me.... I have ordered House Atreides to occupy Arrakis to mine the spice... thus replacing their enemies the Harkonnens.... House Atreides will not refuse because of the tremendous power they think they will gain. Then, at an appointed time Baron Harkonnen will return to Arrakis and launch a sneak attack on House Atreides... I have promised the Baron five legions of my Sardaukar terror troops.
Yes, Sire.
Not in the mood?! Mood's a thing for cattle and love play... not fighting.
Things have been so serious here lately.
No, but many consider my training valuable.
Stop!  Get back!!  She has the weirding way.  Why didn't you tell us!  Great gods... if you can do this to the strongest of us you're worth ten times your weight of water.  As a leader of my people I give you my bond: teach us this weirding way and you both shall have sanctuary.  Your water shall mingle with our water.

I will permit it to pass over me and through me. -- The Reverend Mother moves her face up to his. Her ancient face with its metal teeth gleaming inches away breathes hotly. She is smiling.
Your mother wants you to tell me about your dreams. I only want to know one thing.... Do they come true?

Don't try your powers on me.  Try looking into that place where you dare not look. You'll find me there staring back at you!! You Bene Gesserit have waited ninety generations to produce the one person your schemes required.  Here I stand.  But... I will never be yours.
Yes. Perhaps he would at that.
Now remember... the first step in avoiding a trap is knowing of its existence.
Are you sure this is okay?
We can't.  Those sons-a-bitches control the rights.
No!  <u>Doctor Acula</u>!  You can still wear the cape, have the fangs... but you're a doctor!  Not a count.
Let me take you to the hospital.
No Bela, that's "incorporates."  Look, just say "This casket has..."
Bela, don't worry.  You're better than all this crap.
"Dear, you are a woman of super strength and beauty.  A lovely vision of exquisitely beauty -- shit!"  Damn!  Eddie, I'm sorry I can't remember all this.  I'm an old man. It's too long.
In life, the decisions that haunt you are the ones where you just don't know... where right or wrong will never be answered.  Years ago, the Hungarians contacted me.  The government wanted me to come home, to be Minister of Culture.
Let's shoot this fucker!  Where do I go?
Goddamn, it's cold!
Bela.  I just wanna thank you again for last night.
Why aren't you on your honeymoon? Where's Myrna?
Jesus Christ, what an evening.  What happened?
Buddy, I don't know if that's such a good idea.
Don't worry.
Okay.  But what if I'm not in <u>too</u> big a hurry?  What if I take a moment to slow down and savor the beauty of life?  To smell a flower?
And, cut...
Mexico!  And guess what I'm going to do there?!
And, CUT!  PRINT IT!  LET'S MOVE ON!

So my associate Mr. Marco tells me you may be interested in investing in a motion picture.
For this one, we need $60,000.
Sorry to bother you while we're shooting, but the guy who owns the stage needs his money.
I kinda need it now.
Yeah.  Well I need the other sixty-thousand.
Well... I've got another project I wasn't gonna tell you about. Lugosi's in it, but he's got a smaller part.  The lead is an ingenue, a sterling young actress named Dolores Fuller.  The title is "Bride Of The Atom."
Yeah...?
<u>I'm</u> interested in the picture business.  My associates and I wish to produce a series of uplifting religious films, on the Apostles. But unfortunately, we don't have enough money.
Yes, but I've got the last footage he ever shot!
What'd you give him all the lines for??  He's unintelligible!
Mr. Reynolds!
So, Mr. Johnson --
So anyway, I've got this new script, "Bride Of The Atom," and there's a part you're ideal for: "Lobo."  He's tough.  A brute.  But he has a heart -- and at the end he saves the girl.
No.  She tink Lobo is waste of my time.  Lobo don't talk.
I can't believe it.  These sound like <u>my</u> problems!
What if I told you you could have a star for $1000??
OUR picture?
I thought this was gonna be a sex- change film!
Good.  And one more thing.  I think your "Written, Directed, and Starring Ed Wood" credit is a bad idea.
Because I can't sell it to save my life!  You made a goddamn feathered fish.  Is it an art film, a horror show, a hygiene flick?  Nobody knows! I'm beggin' people to book it.
You're not gonna believe the first picture I ever saw.  Your friend's.
Oh.  Okay.
Ed, this spaghetti sauce is delicious.
The left.  It's more natural.  Hey, I've got a scene where the aliens have the ultimate bomb.  What would that be made of?
Look, it's Dr. Tom.  Hey, Dr. Tom!
But it's pouring.  And the car top is stuck!
Look... would it be possible to make the "Ghoul's Wife" a little less prominent, so people won't really notice me in the movie?
Hell, I've seen a lot worse reviews. I've seen ones where they didn't even like the costumes!  Like, that last "Francis the Mule" picture -- it got <u>terrible</u> notices.  But it was a huge hit.
This is our choir director.  He's gonna play the young hero.
I thought this was a group effort.
B-but it's our money --
No, no!  I like girls.  So how 'bout Friday?
No. Kissing and hugging, okay, but if it's actual sex they have to cut away.
Jeanette, you're hurting me.
What?!
So?
What did you study?
That has my work number, my home number, my pager number. I sleep three hours a night. Call me whenever you want to talk. Off the air, on the air, whenever. Okay?
Uh-huh?
Yeah?!
Yeah.
Ed --
He's who we want to go with.
Take him off the air.
Mr. Pekurny.

Very quick. Between you and me, it's not a bad way to go. Making love to your wife... it's very sweet.
Al!
You know who we are?
Aah, I wanted Shari to come.
She could've been a nurse.
She had white shoes.
I'm at the hospital.
Who?
What?
Oh my god! On TV!
One thing led to another. He was my husband once.
Right, yeah --
She won't.
Look, if you don't let me out of this... I'11 just... I'11 just sit in my apartment all day. I won't go anywhere, I won't do anything. What kind of show will that be?
What are you doing?
I batted!
You do though, you look great.
Ha!
I've got news for you-- I never intended to marry him.
I mean bad.
Oh my God.
Me too. I mean I'm going out with Ray and I'm... thinking about you.
What are you doing?
It's really a tremendous turnoff.
I wish my stepfather was here.
Shari, I really like you...
Twenty-nine.
I tried to tell you over the phone -- my parents went to Atlantic City.
What do you want me to do? You want me to quit the show?!
This is going right up your ass.
I'm making a tape.
Polish acrobat.
Hey, Ed. Did you hear about Marcia?
Richie!  She spent six months dating a criminal
Hello... Shari, hi... Oh no! ... Oh God!
What is this? What's going on, who is that?
What are we gonna fight? Ray, please, listen to me --
You know what your problem is?
Ray, where do you keep the glasses?
Hi, Shari.
Mr. Pekurny. I'm sorry to bother you. My son would just love to have your autograph.
Quite a shithole, isn't it?
That girl's an idiot.
What would I actually have to do to get you to sign this?
You could tell Dave was one of those guys who taught because they never wanted to leave high school in the first place, and that could get a little irritating sometimes, but basically he was a real good guy.
I don't need a lecture on ethics, Jim, okay?  I know what --
what?
No, I'm not. I'm just really busy.
Around that time Diane and I were hanging out a lot at Sherry Novotny's house, giving her our love and support and helping her make it through a difficult time.
Yeah. No. I mean, you know.
Having a problem with your eye there?
Mr. M.?
Fuck me, Mr. McAllister
Tim Kobza?  Tim Kobza!  Who's he? I've never heard of him!
I was.  So?  Mr. Pecharda let me in. As you know, with all my responsibilities I often come in on the weekend and have permission to do so. But I left very early, around 6:30.
Huh.  Right.  College.  Wow.  Where are you going?  Where 'd you get into?
Where to?
Life would go on, and I would certainly be a stronger and wiser person from the experience.
So... what do you have to tell me?
Looks at her skeptically  doesn't say a word.
And when did you do it?
I don't believe you.
After Dave got fired, Sherry kicked him out of the house and filed for divorce.
I can't afford this stuff right now.
Shall we give it a name?
Yep.
I know.  I understand disappointment. I really do.
253... 254... 255. I get the same as you Jim. Looks like Paul's our president.
Whoa! Easy, Fouch. I don't like where you're going.
People can see this.
Uhhh... teeth. Teeth.
She's doing this to get back at me
Thought what?
Hell, good luck!
Yeah.
Can I sign yours too?
I just thought, well, last time you got suspended you fell so behind and -
Sure, Paul.  No hard feelings.
That obvious, huh?
Have you ever heard of Dick Stensland?
Yeah I know.  Patchett's running whores and judging by his address, probably something bigger on the side.  He doesn't want any attention.
There's blood on your shirt.  Is that an integral part of your job?
He takes a cut of our earnings and invests it for us.  He makes us quit the life at thirty.  He doesn't let us use narcotics and he doesn't abuse us.  Can your policeman's mentality grasp those contradictions?
I don't know.
Does that paper say we've been indicted?  Does it say Exley's a hero for squealing me and Stensland off?
How what, Wendell?
Rain check me, partner.  I got something big going on tonight.
No.  I'll tell you sometime.  Not now.  Don't want to jinx it.  But it could take the edge off that jail time I got coming.
Mrs. Lefferts, I'm Officer White with the L.A.P.D.  I'd like to ask a couple of questions.
Maybe.  I don't know.
Yeah, that's Stens.
Why?
I knew Stensland and Meeks knew each other.  Meeks was with Sue Lefferts on Christmas Eve.  The night I met Lynn.  Lefferts' mother I.D.ed Stensland as Lefferts' boyfriend, but Stens pretended he didn't know either one of them.
Pierce Patchett figures in, too. That's the angle Jack was working. Dudley must work for Patchett.
You figured this was a set-up? And you showed up anyway?
Where's the other guy?  Buzz.
Thanks, but no thanks.
You wanna go downtown and discuss this officially?
Wendell White, how's tricks, <u>paesano</u>?
What do you want, <u>officer</u>?
What do you want to know?
Cotton balls.  I found them just inside the meat locker door.
I want to know who we give the public in contrast?  The department needs role models. Clean-cut, <u>forthright</u> men the public can admire.
More or less.
Anything?
Nothing, Ray.  That Larry, he's a pisser.  You did the Casitas Youth Camp with him, didn't you?
Oh?  you feel that way about people, too?
I don't want a floor plan; I want to know who!  Who's taking the ticket for this, Johnny?
You'll make lieutenant inside a year.  Patrol division?
No.
Stensland's a disgrace.  Straight D fitness reports from every C.O. he ever served under.  But White is a valuable officer.
I'm loathe to kill my brother officers, Edmund.
Something like that.
Twelve years ago he worked a vice roust with Dick Stensland.  They arrested a Pierce Patchett on an extortion scam.  Guy ran hookers. He'd have them photographed with their johns, then double-dip for some blackmail.  Charges got dropped.  Insufficient evidence. You were supervising officer on the case and I was wondering if you remember anything about it.
You're the key witness?
Yeah, Exley.  What's the payoff?
You're playing an angle, college boy.  You're getting something out of this so you don't have to hobnob with the fucking rank and file cops who'll hate your guts for snitching.  If they're making you a detective, watch out.  Some Bureau guys are gonna burn in this and you're gonna have to work with friends of theirs.
So what's the point?
The Nite Owl was solved, Lieutenant.
She is Lana Turner.
What are you going to do?
Decorated?
I get the idea.  You got a description?
We got a total of forty-five spent 12-gauge Remington shotgun shells. Three men with five-shot-capacity pumps.  All of them reloading twice.
Miss Bracken, I'm Lieutenant Exley.
I'm curious about you.
You don't like that you don't know how to play him.  He doesn't follow the same rules of politics you do.  That makes him dangerous.
You're tougher than Bud thinks you are.
Like recognizes like.  I'm pretty tough, myself.
It's okay.  These are police.  <u>What</u> do you want?
We did a piece last year. 'Ingenue Dykes In Hollywood.'  Her name got mentioned.
Contract players at Metro.  You pinch 'em.  I do you up feature in the next issue.  Plus the usual fifty cash.  Tell me, am I fucking Santa Claus?
How'd you like a little payback? Not to mention a donation to the widows and orphans fund.  Did you know Loew was a swish?
What happened with the kid and Loew?
No, Sergeant.  I checked twice.
Was it a party?
Yeah.  Me and Patchett go way back.
Working whores with squad two.
I just gave him my card.
209 to anyone! I need some help here!
It's actually DH-1 Digitech Pinpoint scanning with a frequency modulator.
Me neither, but the upshot is I've got color live-action footage of you and Ms Hawkins and it doesn't look good.
I'll come straight there.
That's who they are.
I don't know what that means.
I don't know what that means.
Wait. What do I do?
I'll pay you.
I taped it off the 11 o'clock news.
I was worried about my hundred and twenty 'K'.
The price rises with the temperature and right now you're smokin'. But you're right, you should shop around and get the best price. I'll just let you out here.
What'd I tell you?
I didn't use my name.
Meade has 18 underground acres of computers. They scan <u>every</u> phonecall for target words like "bomb" or "President". We red-flag phone numbers or voice prints...whatever we wanted. When the computers found something, it was bounced to comparative analysis.
That was twenty years ago. With digital? They can suck a salt grain off a beach.
Well, actually, <u>you</u> have proof. Could you walk a little faster please.
They're here.
We lost 'em.
Fuckin-A.
These guys are incredibly persistent.
Drive.
What if we transmitted it over cellular?
Who's calling?
The thing is, Senator, and I don't want to get in the middle of nothing, but--
I yanked this off your RV. It's a Global Positioning Tracker.
Is it okay?
Hey, Mr. D., what's happenin'?
How 'bout Christian Dior?
What size?
Your stuff?
A police report.
Someone said you spoke to Mr. Zavitz before he died. I thought you might know something.
Mr. Zavitz was in trouble.
We'd appreciate your cooperation.
I don't know what's goin' on with Zavitz, but that was way, <u>way</u> outa line.  You understand?
Uh-oh.
So you tap everyone's phone? You use computers to probe financial records? New Search and Seizure laws?
Have you been working with Rachel?
It's not true.
I told you I didn't want you seeing her.
You told me you weren't seeing her at <u>all</u>.
I know.
My suitcase--
Is this a fuckin' joke?
That ain't me.
You don't know who the fuck--
And then what?
Here's what you asked for. Brill's note said it was everything you'd need to, shall we say, coax DePinto--
DePinto?
"Soon". Or at least sooner than never.
Ten thousand cash. I don't know if it's Brill's prices going up or your commission.
How can I be sure.
This conversation's over.
What makes you think it's you?
Yeah?
He didn't <u>give</u> me--
He didn't <u>give</u> me--
What's his name?
Gentlemen--
A leave of absence. Until we've sorted this all out.
Well that's why I'm here, Mr. Dean. 'Cause you're a labor lawyer.
Last night, Larry Spinks, he works the Steel Press, he goes to a bar with his wife Rosalie to have a glass of chianti 'cause it's his birthday, and these two guys, these Guido mother-fuckers, they jump him when he goes to the bathroom.
She doesn't want to talk to you.
Some of 'em.
Dad!
Are you and mom getting a divorce?
Who won the fight?
They took the espresso machine. The <i>espresso</i> machine, Jerry! Which makes sense, you know, because the crooks probably wanted to make themselves a latte before fencing the stereo.
No.
No.
What?
Your Bellmoth case. The FBI thinks there might be mob ties.
Jerry--
It's the NSA. They're the ones doing this.
My stuff's all over her apartment.
Jerry--
It's me, Robert Dean.  From Seth, Silverberg. I worked on--
I'm just doing some Christmas shopping. It's for my wife, no kidding. Though, this isn't the <i>main</i> present, it's just, you know, a little--
Are you okay?
Dick Burns got a phone call this morning from someone wanting information on you.
What does that have to do with you?
Was Zavitz in trouble?
What is it you want?
What's your opinion?
Then what's your goddam opinion?
He's clever? He had help?  Oh.
Yes sir.
No sir.
And they have the video. That's confirmed.
If he's with Lyle it means he's got resources.
Three minutes. We're going in light. Myself and two others. Everyone else is held back in reserve.
This guy's carrying the <u>flag</u> for the damn terrorism bill. You think this is the best time to piss him off?
Then let's assume I don't.
This is an incredible story - about a man hunting an Ostrich, he's been telling me about Zerzura, he thinks he's been there, but his map, the route he's describing, he couldn't survive the journey now, but he's a poet, so his map is poetry - and now we're onto an Ostrich.  I'm telling her your map is poetry. The Arab shrugs.
Actually, you sing.
Will you not come in?
Don't.
When were you least happy?
This is - what is this?
This - what's it called? - this place, I love it - this is mine!  I'm asking the King permission to call it the Almasy Bosphorous.
I don't care to bargain.  It's full of saffron, just in case you think I'm giving it to you to encourage your sewing.
Of course.  You didn't need to slap my face to make me feel as if you'd slapped my face.
Don't you know you drove everybody mad?
Don't leave me!
Do you promise?  I wouldn't want to die here.  I wouldn't want to die in the desert. I've always had a rather elaborate funeral in mind, with particular hymns.  Very English.  And I know exactly where I want to be buried.  In our garden.  Where I grew up. With a view of the sea.  So promise me you'll come back for you.
I'm sorry, Katharine.
Have you seen Katharine?
I understand you are agitated - perhaps you would like to sit down while I radio back to HQ -
And where are the Expedition Maps?
Those maps belong to His Majesty's Government.  They're confidential. They shouldn't be left lying around for any Tom, Dick or Mary to have sight of.
Why do they care about our maps?
I believe I'm rather late.
We didn't care about countries. Did we?  Brits, Arabs, Hungarians, Germans.  None of that mattered, did it?  It was something finer than that.
I have to teach myself not to read too much into everything.  Comes of too long having to read so much into hardly anything at all.
May God make safety your companion.
Hey!  Hey!  Stop this jeep!  Let me out of here - there's a woman dying, there's a woman dying while I'm - Hey!
Your leg will be fine.  A lot of shrapnel came out - I saved you the pieces.
No, I'll get you some tea. Wait till you're in Naples.  You'll find a girl there.
Would it? She kisses him, very softly, on the lips.
Why is there so much nose?  I can't hear myself think!  Look - give me something.  So we can all get out of this room.  A name.  A code.  It's too hot.
Well, you must know.  You were brought up Libya, yes?
I'd like to stay.  That's the long and short of it.  I mean, you know blah-blah if it's convenient, if there's room blah-blah-blah.  I have to do some work here -I speak the language. There are Partisans to be -  -we embrace them and see if we can relieve them of their weapons, you know - while we hug.  I was a thief, so they think I'd be good at that.
Supper. Hana calls after him.
It's a week.  We didn't know where you were - or if you coming back, or -
What if I told you he did this to me?
I'm one of his ghosts and he wouldn't even know.  It's like he slammed a door in Cairo and it trapped my fucking hands in Tobruk.
I think that's called looting.
Well, then ask him his name!
Buon' giorno.
Hello.
Have a drink.
I'd seen you writing in that book. At the Embassy in Cairo, when I had thumbs and you had a face. And a name.
What did you say?
I was just saying, I'm going to cable Downing Street, see if I can't stir up a few shillings - Katharine's mother and the PM's wife are best -
Marvelous plane.  Did you look?
I think you know all of us, except for Geoffrey and Katharine Clifton, who've recently come out from England.
Good heavens, are you married, Madox?
Oh - I've found plums.  We have plums in the orchard.  We have an orchard! She has peeled a plum and now slips it into his mouth.
I will hide you in the room where we sleep, said Candaules. She stumbles over the word.
I should try and move your bed.  I want you to be able to see the view.  It's good, it's a view from a monastery.
Could I have a cigarette?
No, I can't go, but if it, if you weren't offended, it would be very good of you to allow us - every other cabin is crammed. This is as private as we'll get.
Tell me about this, this is in your handwriting - December 22nd - Betrayals in war are childlike compared with our betrayals during peace.  New lovers are nervous and tender, but smash everything - for the heart is an organ of fire  I love that, I believe that.  Who is K?
I liked it better when there were just the two of us.
You like him, don't you?  Your voice changes.
I'm still here.
Who knows the Bosphorus Hug?
You don't have any money, do you? Just in case there's silk.
Where's your Stuart from? Somewhere near there, isn't it?
Excuse me.  Yes?  I don't have the key to that door.
I see.  Then may be you're safe as long as you only play Bach.  He's German. Kip is looking around the piano. Hana giggles.
Try this.  I found a great jar of it. Olive oil.  In Naples this was so precious it would have bought you a wife.
Don't go.  I'm frightened.  I can love a coward, I can't love another dead man.
Will you come with me?
I know - here I am always a brown man, there you would be always a white woman.
I'll always go back to that church. Look at my painting.
It's not safe here.  The whole country's crawling with Bandits and Germans and God knows what.  It's madness.  I can't allow it. You're not, this is natural - it's shock. For all of us.  Hana -
I've got a surprise.  A boat!  We can go to Capri.  It's got a cabin, it's private.
I was looking forward to this evening.
Yessir.
I'm afraid we're not having much luck obtaining funds for the expedition.
What I really object to, Uncle, is your finishing all my condensed milk.  And the message everywhere in your book - however slowly I read it - that the best destiny for India is to be ruled by the British.
No.
You didn't answer the beeper either.
That's great if you're a computer. In the real world that pane weighs 200 pounds. The building's 600 feet high.
You ordering chop suey again?
In the middle? You've got the Mask, why don't we have him?
I'm sorry about the scroll, but sometimes you have to lose to win.
Seems I am.
You disappeared.
Yes. But they don't have a clue.  Why would anyone steal my luggage?
I didn't expect you to be so...
I've got something for you.
It's a test.
But--
What the hell was that?
Motorcycle.
It's one way.
We're going to die, aren't we...
Those are my clothes.
You stole my luggage? You--
And--
Why are we in separate--you know, separate rooms?
Nice spot.
Only a week?
So the Duke dug a tunnel--just in case. They made the lake a hundred years later. Flooded the tunnel.
I go in alone.
I'll need that.
On what? Another job?
A partner with secrets isn't much of a partner.
Let's do it again.
All this, this is a woman's version of what you would like.
And you've checked the ram to be sure it's synchronized with the clock.
Got it.
Won't take any time.
You were afraid of heights?
He wasn't.
We're working.
Can you see the other PIRs?
The big job.
What?
Your share.
If you want a partner, I think you should recalculate the split.
No, really, it's your plan, you should get at least 30 per cent--
Insidious thing, wondering if your partner...has another partner.
Do you know what you've done!? Do you know?
What about the rules?
Nope. The CD instructs the computer to replace those instructions with an innocuous loan coded XJ-6.
That's where the Mask comes in.
You can't be serious.
You're out of your mind. We can't do a job like this with no rehearsal.
For God's sake, the only way I can get from one elevator to the other is to jump.
Two men in the world don't need passwords or codes. Their retinas will scan to unlock everything. one of those two men is the chairman of the bank.
Parachute.
He looks familiar.
They work off the O2 tank just like the slice pack.
I'd say she's a size 6 who wears a size 4.
Oh, it is.
It's too soon.
Oh, look at me, darling. I thought this gentleman was a waiter.
Tonight your league night?
Call it an expression of trust.
My friend, you always surprise me.
See you.
Where've you been?
You shouldn't judge, Brenda.
I didn't mean for you to leave them in the middle of the floor.  Jesus.  Look at me. What do I have this afternoon?
Seventeen thousand in debt.  Whew.  Is your ex-husband helping out?
So.  You must've been feeling pretty desperate that afternoon.
Cause of the chromium.
... Matthew's six, Katie's four, and Beth's just nine months.
You never called me back.  I left messages.
I'm sorry about that.  Really.  But --
Okay, look.  If you really want to apply for a job here, you can do it the way everyone else does.  Send in a rsum, make an --
Okay, enough --  Now, look, Erin -- this incident aside, I don't think this is the right place for you. So what I'm gonna do is make a few calls on your behalf.  Find you something else, okay?
Oh, yeah?
That document you found, the one that says it was the bad chromium -- you didn't happen to make a copy did you?
This is the only thing you found?
Okay, so here's what I'll do.  I'll go on up to Ted and Rita Daniels -- two of the nicest people you'd ever hope to meet, who spend every single day watching their little girl fight like a dog against this cancer -- I'll tell them we can't help them cause you don't feel like working that hard.
They used the hex chrom here, in these cooling tanks, as an anti-corrosive.  Then they dumped it here, in these six ponds.
Erin -- lemme tell you something.  If I'da put three researchers on this, I wouldn't expect them to dig up all the information you got here.  This is some damn good work.
I like this case.
Hey.  I like working with you.
So what are you thinking?
People don't fly down in their own god damn plane for "just a meeting" --
You're emotional.  You're erratic.  You say any God damn thing that comes into your head.  And I'm not saying that's bad.  That can be great; that can be a lot of fun --
How dare you take that away from me.
If you're here to fire me, your timing's lousy.
So why would PG&E offer it?
Wait, what do you mean, ten years?
The fuck I'm not.  I don't care what the doctor says --
Ho - ly - shit.
I did.  Both.
But I know you're not gonna quit on me.
How many counts?
And you were told to destroy those?
Course as it turns out, I'm not a very good employee.
Hey, Ross.  Tell me something.  Does PG&E pay you to cover their ass, or do you just do it out of the kindness of your heart?
So that stuff -- it kills people.
Well, how do I find out what kind of chromium is up in Hinkley?
I hate it too.  I hate this trip.
I never forget, honey.  I try, real hard. It's just, for some reason, I don't seem to be able to organize things right and -- when it comes to you guys, I end up falling short.
I said, <u>whose number do you need</u>?
Which number do you want, George?
Cause I don't even know you.
This isn't gonna get you laid, you know.
What are you doing here?
You're not nothing, Erin.
Yeah, you can.  You could just quit.  People do it all the time.
You already packed up your stuff?
They up?
I'm embarrassed.
What am I supposed to do, check in every two seconds?
Now how'm I supposed to do that when I'm not in here most mornings and nights?
Excuse me, are you Erin Brockovich?
When Donna told us about you, and what you told her about the chromium, we figured that might have something to do with this, too.
What?
You're moving away?  When?
Who's Baxter?
They've both got some immune system problem. Can't say what from, whether it's viral or genetic or what, but something's wrong.  And these guys -- Donna and Peter --
... and when I realized our area's just as bad as Hinkley, I thought maybe my neighbors are all sick too.  So I went and asked.
Soon, Lord Vader.
I can't ...
How you doing, Chewbacca?  Still wasting your time with this clown, eh?
Barks at his master.
... the power?
Yeah ...
I'm looking for a great warrior.
Listen, friend, we didn't mean to land here, and if I could get my fighter out of this puddle I would, but I can't.  So ...
Give me that!
... I told you, I'm not hungry.
Because of my father, I guess.
The night storms will start before you can reach the first marker.
But, if he could be turned, he would be a powerful ally.
Good, and Commander Skywalker?
That's right.
Captain Solo, sir. Might I have a word with you?
He doesn't make sense to me either, Chewie.
I think we're in trouble.
I can see the edge of the asteroid field, sir.
Yes, Your Highness?
Am I?  I say you came running after me because you were afraid I was leaving you without even a kiss.
.... I'm afraid there's not much left.
You must have gone completely out of your feeble mind.
That Star Destroyer is slowing down.
There, there.  Chewie get a reading on that.  Looks pretty good.
Sometimes, maybe ... occasionally, when you aren't acting like a scoundrel.
I see it Chewie, hang on.
Funny, I have the feeling I've been in this area before.  Let me check my logs.
A Tibanna gas mine.  Lando won it in a sabacc match, or so he claims. Lando and I go way back.
He found him in a junk pile ...
No thanks.
I was worried about you.
Loud and clear, kid.  What's up?
Why you slimy, double-crossing no-good swindler ... am I glad to see you.
You don't know much about much if you think Vader won't want us dead before this is over.
That was never mentioned.  Neither was this bounty hunter taking Han. I hope you haven't forgotten our bargain.
That wasn't the bargain.  You said the Empire wouldn't interfere in--
Chewie's right.  We must try to save Han.
The deflector shields are gone.
Have they analyzed the one that was killed?
We've picked up something outside the base in zone one, moving East.
Two transports at a time is awfully risky.
Sir, we've lost the rear deflector shield.  One more direct hit on the back quarter and we're done for.
Leia ... What would you think if I went away for a while?
That's just great.  Why doesn't everyone just take off?
Lando, is he alright? ... Lando? Are you there?  How's Luke?
Ready are you?  What know you of ready?  I have trained Jedi for 800 years.  My own counsel I'll keep on who is to be trained.
I have followed my feelings.
It would be in seven pieces, were you a Jedi.
I can't. It's too big.
I don't believe it.
That they are.
I feel cold.
Ben?  Ben?
I see them! ... They're in pain ... they're suffering.
They're my friends.
Yes, yes.  To Obi-wan you listen young one.  The tree.  Remember your failure at the tree!  Heh?
And sacrifice Han and Leia?
The fear does not reach you.  You have learned more than I anticipated.
The Force runs strong in the Skywalker line.  You will achieve great power ... Come, join with me!  Together we will be the most powerful ... even stronger than The Emperor.
There is no escape.  You must join me or die.  Don't make me destroy you here ... The Emperor is strong with The Force.  But if you join me, together we could overthrow Him.  Do not resist. It is our destiny!
Seventeen ships destroyed, we don't know how many got away.
To a lot of psychiatric small talk --
Go easy, Stevie.
But he isn't us.  He's your own kind.
May I say something personal?
He doesn't look like his picture.  I bet he's fake.
Ooww!
Give it to me.
Oh Cuervo...
It's so good to see you again.
Why should we leave? I love L.A. Where we gonna go? What's the payoff?
Get me to Cuervo Jones. Get me to the Kingdom. I got one hour.
I think we've burned off enough fuel. We may be lighter enough to hover. Just barely.
Third World wants to live like we do - and they plan on taking what they want. The Cubans and Brazilians are ready to invade Miami. If the Africans and Colombians make a run at the border, we got a full scale attack on the United States.
Where do I put ashore?
Not you?
It's the President, for Christ's sake!
Where are they?
Stop the damn car.
Where is it?
Aw, come on, Snake.
Is that what I think it is?
Could be a big one comin' any minute now...
You ain't doin' so good, Snake. You need help.  You should talk to Hershe. She hates Cuervo. They used to be partners, but they split up.
Why don't you get out of L.A.? Take a boat to China, take an airplane to Brazil?  Earthquakes, death, shit. Why do you stay?
Well, I'll think it over.
In the name of God, of St. Michael, and St. George, I make you a knight. Rise, Sir...
When you threw it in, what did you see?
Fight me from your horse or on foot, but fight me. Your avoidance mocks me.
Sir, your rage has unbalanced you. It seems you would fight to the death against a knight who is not your enemy, for a length of road you can ride around.
Lancelot, how did you fare in the North?
Arthur.
Who is Merlin?
Merlin, help me. I need your help. I don't know how--
What?!
But, I'm here.
Father...
Sir... Kay needed a sword. His was stolen. I saw Excalibur, and... I took it.
The Queen will be in my charge till a champion steps forward to fight on her behalf.
Why can't you be my champion?
I have waited long for you. Once you almost saw, but fear blinded you. Why am I served from the chalice?
And there is no maiden in the whole world who inspires you?
Why didn't he kill us?
Very well. Climb up.
You left your husband's side? You left your brother's wedding?
A lovestruck page!
You know what I want. I want the secret of true magic, how to thicken the stuff of dreams and wishes with the flesh of the world.
Merlin, the powers of Summoning, the true Name of the charms of Doing and Undoing. Show me!
I swear it. By Excalibur and the holy--
Maybe not even that, Uther. I thought once that you were the one to unite the land under one sword. But it'll take another, a greater king...
Burke take a look at this damn thing it just doesn't make sense.
Well why are they tearing the building down?
What honey?
Well, he does know the background. I doubt there's any danger in just having him assist. There should be a psychiatrist present, anyway.
You're convinced that it's genuine.
It's a stylized ritual in which rabbis or priests try to drive out the so-called invading spirit. It's pretty much discarded these days, except by the Catholics who keep it in the closet as a sort of embarrassment. It has worked, in fact, although not for the reason they think, of course. It was purely the force of suggestion. The victim's belief in possession helped cause it; and just in the same way this belief in the power of exorcism can make it disappear.
What's Burke got to do with it?
Phonograph.
You were expecting a deliver y that day?
I know that. I realize. But if a certain British doctor never asked "What's this fungus?" we wouldn't today have penicillin. Correct?
Thank you.
Good morning Madame.
A man to see you.
Is it coming out Willie?
Now this is for Ritalin. Ten miligrams a day.
Oh no. I'd wait and see what happens with the Ritalin. I think that's the answer. Wait two or three weeks.
Lies?
Have you ever known your daughter to swear and use obscenities?
Well, I'd say her vocabulary's rather extensive.
Hey do me a favour will ya'. Tell me something good.
She's heavily sedated. She'll probably sleep through tomorrow.
Do you keep any drugs in your house?
Did he tell you about my party?
To begin with it could make things worse.
No I couldn't, I have to have church approval, and frankly, that's rarely given,-
Yes I could, I could see her as a psychiatrist...
Thanks. Look, I'm only against the possibility of doing your daughter more harm than good.
Oh mom, you should have seen this man came along on this beautiful grey horse.  Wasn't it pretty?
You've been playing with it?
Regan, why are you reading that?
What are we gonna do on your birthday, isn't that nice it's on a Sunday this year, what can we do?
Well thank you very much but why on earth would I want to bring Burke on your birthday?
Oh Regan I love your daddy. I'll always love your daddy. Burke just comes around here a lot because he's lonely, don't got nothin' to do.
Well your thinking's not so good.
She doesn't remeber a thing.
Goodbye Father. I call you.
Where'd you get the money for the Chivas Regal? The poor box?
Think you can sleep?
I get passes. In fact I got a pass for The Crest tomorrow night. Would you like to go?
Withering Heights.
Where's Regan?
Your mother's in here with us Karras, would you like to leave a message? I'll see that she gets it.
You speak Latin?
Quod nomen mihi est?
You are not happy. Tell me what is the matter?
Do you want to hear the background of the case, first?
We may ask what is relevant, but anything beyond that is dangerous. He is a liar, the demon is a liar. He will lie to confuse us. But he will also mix lies with the truth to attack us. The attack is psychological , Damien. And powerful. So don't listen, remember that, do not listen.
Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come, thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day, our daily bread, and forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation.
Be unto her o' Lord a fortified tower.
And let my cry come unto thee.
What is it?
You're not my mother!!!
Have we met?
You this director was doing a film here, Burke Dennings?
Really?
Let me tell you how Father, and please confidential. Burke Dennings, good Father, was found at the bottom of those steps leading to 'M' Street, with his head turned completely around. Facing backwards.
Ah, doctor's ethics. If you knew you wouldn't tell, huh?
I get passes to the best shows in town. Mrs. K though, she gets tired and never likes to go.
Answer the question, Father Paranoia.
Stick your cock up her ass! You mother fucking, worthless cocksucker!
Your mother sucks cocks in hell Karras, you faithless slime!
...in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ!!! It is he who commands you! He who flung you from the heights of Heaven to the depths of hell!
Yes I am her brother, he's the son
Are you comfortable Regan?
Give me the keys!
It's my goddamn car!
What about tomorrow?
So?
Oh. No. Strictly dryland.
Well, look at this.
Honey ...
Beasley.
What's our friend's problem?
Start him out on cottage cheese. If you've got him on kibble, just soak it a few minutes.  Go down like pudding through a hot pipe.
Knee.  Tore it up against St. Anthony's.  Right before the accident.
What do you say we go for a walk, pal.
You're a real tough guy when the ladies are around, aren't you, Ace?
I thought these were lost. Where did you find ...
Oh, look at you two.  So skinny. And those tiny suits ...
When they coming in?
Tag 'em, Willie.  The Regency downtown, Thursday-Friday.  Thanks.
That's a lot of water under the bridge, eh, Jack?
Don't make trouble, all right?
Count it.
This isn't the Pine Tree Inn on Route 81, Jack.
So we on tomorrow night?
Listen ... why don't you come out to the house this weekend.  Say hello to the kids. They've grown.
It was an accident.
She didn't know what she was doing. You're too sensitive.
What d'ya got?
What do you think?
Seeing anyone in particular?
I'm not seeing anyone.  In particular.
This time you gotta go.
What was it like?
Thirty-seven.  Thirty-seven.
Jack.
What are you, crazy?
I suppose we can bring it down a little.
Get out of here.
I just wish she'd get here, that's all.
Sounds like a booking agent looking to book an easy fee.
Okay I'll see you tomorrow night then.
Just a lucky guess.
Very realistic.
You want to come out to the house tomorrow? The way the bookings been piling up, Donna's decided to really lay it on.  Turkey, stuffing, the whole bit.  Kitchen's so full of food you can hardly move.  We could use another appetite.
We were playing the lounge one night and she came in.
He's drunk.
Have some more wine, Frank.
Unless you want the right.
We might as well do the towels the same way.
All night?
What the hell are you doing?
Really.
You haven't seen Susie, have you?
He had to come quickly.  It was a big leak.
What're you doing down here?
Couple years.
April.
God, the old man would've loved this view, wouldn't he?
Yeah, and you drank yours like it was orange juice. He loved that about you.
Yeah, but he told you things.  He never told me anything.  Even though I was the oldest. It was always you two, running off, doing things together.
That takes care of this week.  The tenth we got the Sheraton, the sixteenth we're at the Capri.
Be reasonable, Jack.
What're you doing?
What's it for?
What-are you?  A fucking moron? It's three o'clock in the morning, Frank.  Who's watching?  Your wife? Maybe you can get us a gig playing Little Frank's birthday party. What do you think?
What's happening to you, Frank?  You been kissing ass so long you're starting to like it?  You let that guy turn us into clowns tonight.  We were always small time, but we were never clowns, Frank. What's happened to your dignity?
Stay off it.
Is everything done?  The arrangements, I mean.
Yeah, fine.
I mean, you can play.  You're okay.
Sick?  How sick?
So she's got a few sniffles.
But if you call my house and my mother answers, ask for Blanche.  If you ask for Monica, she'll think you have the wrong number and hang up.
Oh, sorry.  I get so caught up in it sometimes.  It's scary.
You're an hour and a half late.
This is show business?
I don't believe it.  I come all the way down down here, break a heel, and you're not gonna give me a chance because I have gum on my lip and I'm a few minutes late.
So run a little longer.
I mean, you're supposed to be backing me up, right?
Christ, look at her. You'd think if she was gonna wear her street clothes she'd have enough sense to come in the back.  Good evening, Miss Diamond.  You're late.
Is there a language problem here?  Your dress. For tonight.  Where is it?
That!  You can't wear that!
It's orange!
Come on.
If you ask me, this is pretty stupid.
Save it for your wife.
What do you think?
Shoes?
We need scissors over here! Who's got scissors?  Okay, remember.  Jack and I go on first, I do the set-up, then introduce you. And you say ...
By the way, I got a messsage yesterday from some guy looking for New Year's action.  Resort, upstate.
Well, well.  Ho, ho, ho.  You moonlighting at Macy's, Frank?
Jesus, you fellas've made a lot of noise.  What's with the stars?
I don't believe it.
Great?
You're kidding me.
Hey, will you look at that?
Oh yeah?
What's with you two?
Got another song for us?
What's with you guys?
How about you?  Got a Bar Mitzvah this weekend?
Terrific, boys.  Really.  Terrific.
Yes, sir.  You're just what we needed on a night like this.
Uh ... You don't know when you'll be wanting us back, do you, Lloyd?
How come?
Funny hours.
Thanks.
No.
Don't worry about it.
Right.  Bring him back.
You want to know if he's okay. Right?
Well, now, where's everyone run off to? Frank?
Where's egghead?
Uh-uh.  I never touch American cigarettes.  What's tomorrow again?
Nice place.  Fulla velvet.  Even the bedspreads.  Damn!  Two-fifty a pack and I go through 'em like toothpicks. Twelve-and-a-half cents a piece, you believe that?
Mmm.  Like kissing a rose.  Well, au revoir.
You kidding?  We must've killed three pots in there.  Anyway, I gotta get home.  Rest the pipes.
He do that every year?
It's the waves.  God's music, my mother used to say. She was crazy for the ocean.
It wasn't business.  It was pleasure.
Relax.  We'll drop the song.
All I said was you were good.
Friend.
Frank said ---
Yeah... No.
Yeah.
Listen... you want to get a drink?  I got a new place.  Or we could go to a bar ...  Well, maybe not a bar.  But I know a place uptown, if you want --
Jack.
No shit. It's the goddamn water. Kill an ox. I buy bottled for my Danny. You can't trust the taps.
Did you break a cup, Jack?
Guess they're up.
Maybe he'll ask your ma to marry him.
Older than me.
I tried Cheerios this morning. He didn't even get up. Maybe they took out the wrong teeth.
You mean if I get sick?
He's lying.
Uh-oh, somebody's in trouble.
And this thing can grow it?
Why would he need more?
Or reactivated the first one.
So?
I don't know.  Everything's jumbled -- so you're going to have to help me fill in a few blanks.
That's not the worst part.
Thanks, Pollux.
She's only 12.  Some day she'll understand that apathy and absence are just special ways of saying "I love you."
... I was dreaming ...
He freaked out when he thought I had seen this stuff.  I think it's a list of cities -- Santiago, Ho Chi Minh City, Nandi ...
How is he?
I started wondering -- if you couldn't switch back -- would it make a difference?
Which ear was it?
You haven't got a chance in hell of fooling Pollux. Castor drinks, smokes and walks around with a 24-hour hard-on.  He's nothing like you.
How is the "date night" idea going over with Eve?
I'm not hiding in my work, if that's what you're saying.
What're you gonna do with me gone?  You'll drive your wife and kid nuts! I bet your daughter is just about ripe by now. What's her name, Janie?
You killed them?
What are you going to do, Castor?
Stay away from my family!
They're too tight.
You better be nice, Castor. You could get mighty lonely now that Pollux is gone.
Just saving the tax-payers the cost of a trial.  So take a hike.
Clarissa left those here.
What are you -- stupid?
Kim?
What happened?
Backing you up!  Didn't you track Castor to the Army Street Terminal?
I can't even look at you without wanting to vomit.
-- I'll be one of the most powerful men in the country. Didn't matter how much cash I made pulling wet jobs -- I was still too low on the food chain -- always with somebody like Jon Archer after me.  The best part is -- I'm the GOOD guy.
I just heard about Castor's fratricide -- rather poetic, don't you think?
I just thought that -- under the circumstances -- you might want to postpone the meeting with the station chiefs.
As much as ever.  Nothing.
Isn't that what all this is about?  Letting Jamie go out, cooking me dinner, -- your next assignment?
You're wearing your suit --
What's on your mind?
I'm late.  Gotta protect and serve the world, y'know.
What are you doing?
Nothing.
-- Yes.
I'll deal with her later.
Remember this from our junior prom?  Boy, were you ever mad for Madonna.
Almost married.  And almost a junior broker at E.F. Hutton...
God, no.  I thought about it for practically the entire flight...
Why Jack?
You have kids, Jack?
Look, I know our paltry little two million in sales is about what you spend on office supplies in a year.  And I know some regional trucking company account is nothing compared to a sixty billion dollar merger...
And I know people.
...thats our war room. We did seven major deals last year, three of them hostile.
Were almost done here...
The aliens...In the mother ship.  You look just like him.
I have winter camp until four, then ballet until five thirty.
Not bad...I shoulda warned you.  Dad always does something really special for their anniversary.
What are you doing?
Im having kind of a bad day.
She is relentless.
Cmon, Evelyn Thompsons got no class.  She doesnt marry Dr. Steve, the womans living in a trailer.
Hey, you cant park that thing here.
I dont care if youre Tim Allen with your fancy car and all your tools, you still cant park here.
Howd you know my name?
Of course. Jack Campbell. I went to high school with you...you played baseball, right?  Youre doing well...
DO YOU WANNA DIE?!
Oh man, you're serious...  This man thinks I need to be saved!
Yeah?  What do you need?
Look, I'm not saying you'd be able to do it without some hard work...
Its a callable asset seized in accordance with the acquisition by-laws of your alt-fate contract...
Do I look like I need your money.  It doesnt work like that and I cant tell you why.
But what do I do?
I'm thinking I might walk tonight, Frank.
...I was the number one junior sales associate at E.F. Hutton in 1988.  Did you know that?
Here we are, mag wheels...  Hey Jack, are you sure youre okay?
Kates on two, Jack.  Nice ride...
About four grand.  And a bottle of twenty five year old scotch from Mrs. Johnson in 9D.  Im putting it all in commercial paper like you said.
Dont  go, Jack...
Believe me I know what an incredible opportunity this is for you...
Right, for us. But...Im afraid that if you get on that plane...
I can't seem to let go of you...
Look, we dont have time for this right now, well talk about it later.  Now get dressed...  Youre not wearing that to the Thompsons party. I dont care how hilarious you think it is...
You look forward to this party all year.  Whats with you today?
Yes, Im fine.  Its just this god awful football phone!  Who has a phone like this anyway?!
Shes your dog, Jack.
Wait a second.  You want me, dont you?
How can you do that?
$2,400?!  Are you out of your mind?
Good, Jack.  Maybe well keep her.
How was the game, honey?
You want the cake!?
Cmon, you know what I like to hear...
Cmon, Jack, you think there arent mornings when I wake up and wonder what the hell Im doing in New Jersey...
I mean yes, I help people that need it...
You know champagne makes me do crazy things.
I could stay here forever...
This place is a perk, Kate.
Youre talking to their new Vice President of Mergers and Acquisitions.
Annie goes to a great school.
I cant believe you want to move back into the city.  I thought the reason we left was because we didnt want to raise the kids here?
I need you to remember me, Kate.  How I am right now, right this very moment.  I need you to put that image in your heart and keep it with you, no matter what happens.
I promise, Jack...
Youre not married, are you?
Please. Lets just go have a cup of coffee. Thats all Im asking for. Im sure theres another flight to Paris tonight.
Mrs. Peterson.
I just got a call from Terry Haight.  Bob Thomas is nervous...
Peter Lassiter...
Ill go for a cup of coffee!
I found it!
You know, you could'a run an ad in the personals.
You don't know what it's like out there.  Walking around like some kind of circus freak.  People staring, whispering --
We're going to have to work on your touch.
No.  I cannot take orders from that underwear model.  That wingnut washed out of NASA for sneaking two Victoria Secret wannabes into a flight simulator.
I don't know.  I just keep going over and over the numbers.
You go through something like this, makes you appreciate having the right woman in your life.
Okay.  I've uh, got some questions, from Sue.  That she thought might be better coming from me... Can you, you know, go to the bathroom...like normal...
Let's see: you got Victor, stud of the year, more coin than God?  Or Reed, the world's dumbest smart guy worth less than a postage stamp.  Hmmm, it's a toss-up.
Where...where am I?
I'll be watching over you.
Deb... It's me.  I need you to step out front.
Oh my G-g-g.  What did you...do to Ben?
Ben, come in.
Reed said it'd be weeks till --
I can handle the ship.  I can even handle Mr. Blonde Ambition.  But I don't know if I should be flying or playing Vegas in these suits.  Who the hell came up with them?
At this rate, the infection should be complete in two, maybe three weeks --
Oh, you dawg you.  Better not be my nurse!
Is there something about flames? About flaming, that you --
What?  No.  I'm trying to figure out why we each ended up with different symptoms.
I mean, you feel a little feverish.
You're on fire!
Apparently I can disappear.
You're really cramping my style here.
You two need a time-out.
I'm sorry, sis, for leaving you guys --
You know, maybe you should get some rest --
This isn't going to be a problem, is it?
We've got <u>minutes</u> until it hits, not hours...Victor, that storm's <u>deadly</u> -- the radiation's lethal.  We need to abort.
Ben's still out there --
What are you doing here?
You're, you've, I mean, how have you bee--
Well, uh, based on our history...you can handle the biogenetics, and I'll focus on the molecular physics.  Or, uhm, maybe I should take the biotech, you work the microscopes, since you have some background in electropho--
Material made from self-regulating unstable molecules.  I've been working on a formula for this.
Which was?
Uh, Sue...?  I <u>can't</u>.
It has to be the cloud.  It's fundamentally altered our DNA.
You should be able to bend light around other objects, even people, if you could control your emotional state better --
I'm saying, if you had a little more self control, you could locate the trigger.  Can you remember the exact emotions when --
There were a lot of variables to consider --
The power...I need...more power...to control...the storm --
Uh, Victor, I hope I haven't done something to make you think...
What's going on?
Victor, your scar --
I'm sorry I didn't get a chance to --
Please don't make this personal --
Reed's gonna fix me up --
Grant's uniquely qualified for this mission. He's a Communications Expert and was a Frogman during the War. Besides, he brought Benes into this country, and the fewer people who know about him, the better. At any rate, you'll find Grant invaluable, should anything go wrong once you're under way.  Okay, Don.
Where do we stand?
Okay to proceed.
But we have no choice! We've got, to take them out!
I know that. But what's the maximum?
They're in the Pulmonary Artery.
What is it?
Hello, Grant. Good to see you again.
Before or after what he wanted to tell you?
Wish I knew why.
There'll be a team of Surgeons standing by. We're prepared to remove you immediately, should anything go wrong. In any event, you must be out within sixty minutes. After that, you'll be in danger of attack.
Just one, General...
Yes, Alan.
[LINE OF DIALOGUE CUT OFF]
Difficult? He's impossible!
I'll be standing by. <I'll> know.
I can't imagine how it possibly could have come loose. I distinctly recall fastening it with all four bolts --
Never saw <that>. Not even under an electron-mrcroscope.
Well, it's not exactly a pleasure cruise.
I never...never imagined it could be anything...like this.
I'll try to hold it from the other side of the wall, while you push from out here. Maybe that'll do it.
Thank you for saving my life.
What do you mean?
We better get back to the sub. Every second counts now.
What can we do?
The ship's good as finished. We'll have to get out on our own! Is there a quick way out?
That's just dandy. We can't go forward -- and we can't go back.
Tell them to take us out.
In a way -- yes. Those are impurities imbedded in the Lung after a lifetime of 'Civilization.' Carbon from smoke and smog -- specks of dust --
All right now -- push the snorkel through as soon as I get inside.
Well, sir? Which is it? The wireless, or Benes' life?
Looks like the sea, at dawn.
Cough? If he can kick up a storm by just <breathing> --
Hold it, Skipper.  What happens if we overstay?
I don't believe that.
Any reserve air?
How's it look?
It's a dangerous procedure. If I miss the timing, we could explode the tanks... But I'm willing to try it.
We could never fight that current it's physically impossible.
...What do you mean, you decided not to park here?
Ophhem ma fuchem gaphe!
Fuck you, man! Where's Jerry? I gave SIMPLE FUCKING INSTRUCTIONS -
Drop that fucking money!
...Is this a fucking joke?
This is a new car, then, sir?
You're required to display temporary tags, either in the plate area or taped inside the back window.
... What is he, deaf?... So, uh, how long have you been with the escort service?
Ya find the work interesting, do ya?
Or your fucking wife, you know.
...Come on, man. Okay, here's an idea. We'll stop outside of Brainerd. I know a place there we can get laid. Wuddya think?
Unguent.
You'll take care of it. Boy, you are smooth smooth, you know.
Yah, but the deal was, the car first, see, then the forty thousand, like as if it was the ransom. I thought Shep told you -
Okay.
...Blood has been shed.
Three people. In Brainerd.
You called me twenty minutes ago and said you had it! Ready to make delivery, ya says! Come on down and get it!  And here ya are and you're wastin' my time and you're wastin' my wife's time and I'm payin' nineteen- five for this vehicle here!
Ah, well, we haven't had to run around like you. When're you due?
Any others?
I thought you'd never ask. The older one is Janet, she's nine, and the younger one is Morgan.
Shep Proudfoot. That's a name.
A subconscious-type thing.
I'm talkin' about your potential.
The financials are pretty thorough, so the only thing we don't know is your fee.
We're not horse-trading here, Wade, we just gotta bite the bullet on this thing.
Ya know, they said no one listenin' in, they'll be watchin', ya know. Maybe it's all bull, but like you said, Stan, they're callin' the shots.
Yah.
...Mr. Lundegaard?
Yah. Yah. Home a Paul Bunyan and Babe the Blue Ox.
Okay, I'll do a damned lot count!
But the deal's already done, I already got the money -
Yah, no problem, I'll just fax that over to ya, then.
Yah!
...Dad?
Yah, Shep Proudfoot said -
I'm sure sorry. I - Shep told me 8:30. It was a mix-up, I guess.
...Dad?
Are you calling Stan?
Yah, you said you'd have a think about it. I understand it's a lot of money -
Oh, nothing, Wade. How ya doin' there?
Yah.
We're good to loan in.
What the heck were you thinkin'? Heck, if I'm only gettin' bank interest, I'd look for complete security. Heck, FDIC. I don't see nothin' like that here.
- All's I know is, ya got a problem, ya call a professional!
Heck, you don't know! You're just whistlin' Dixie here! I'm sayin', the cops, they can advise us on this! I'm sayin' call a professional!
... Stan, I'm thinkin' we should offer 'em half a million.
Where is everybody?
Geez, you okay, Margie?
...Well, that passed.
You look in his citation book?
...Last vehicle he wrote in was a tan Ciera at 2:18 a.m.  Under the plate number he put DLR - I figure they stopped him or shot him before he could finish fillin' out the tag number.
Yah?
...Geez.
How we doin' on that vehicle?
...You can sleep, hon. It's early yet.
Yah, that's me.
...This is a nice place.
Huh? Oh, okay, I'm sorry.
Yah, well, I, uh... it's not that it didn't work out - Linda passed away. She, uh...
You were such a super lady...  and then I... I been so lonely...
Nope.
Yep.
Nope.
No, I'm leavin' this mornin', back up to Brainerd.
Mm. But ya think he's all right? saw him last night and he's -
Linda Cooksey?
So... they didn't...
Gustafson's accountant.
Yah, the loudmouth. So the whole state has it, Lundegaard and Gustafson?
Whose car?
Aw, hon, you're better'n them.
Was it reasonable?
...So?
It's just the three cent.
Hautman's blue-winged teal got the twenty-nine cent. People don't much use the three-cent.
There's no one else here.
This was a support group for men with testicular cancer.  The big moosie slobbering all over me was Bob.
And the second rule about it is... you're not supposed to talk about it. And the third rule...
He was full of pep.  Must've had his grande latte enema.
Hmm?
We need to talk.
This is Detective Stern with the arson unit.  We have some new information about the "incident" at your condo.
Red-and-blue Tuinal, lipstick-red Seconals.
I'm on to you.  You're a faker.  You aren't dying.
Why are you doing this?
It becomes an addiction.
Look, I can't cry with a faker present.
You're kidding.
Um... Marla, should we maybe exchange numbers?
In case we want to switch nights.
It's for men.
Picture yourself watching Marla Singer throw herself around her crummy apartment.
Except for their humping, Tyler and Marla were never in the same room.
I don't know ...
This is a sweet side of you.  Picking these up for ...  "Mrs. Haniver" and... "Mrs. Raines." Where are they?
No, thanks.
You... don't have to... leave.
You hear that?
That... sawing and hammering.
No.
What is this?  Who did this?
Yeah?
What did you say... ?
Say my name!  What's my name!?
I don't want to hear anything you've got to say.
Because... I'm Tyler Durden.
You got about thirty seconds.
Two sides?  You're Dr. Jeckle and Mr. Jackass.
Marla...
How have you been?
I mean -- for a living.
Thank you.
What list?
God, it's late.  I should find a hotel...
Would that be a problem?
What?
-- Like splicing single frames from adult movies into family films.
... Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.
No.  That's a good thing, isn't it?
Oh, yeah.  I didn't know my dad.  Well, I knew him, till I was six.  He went and married another woman, had more kids. Every six years or so he'd do it again -- new city, new family.
I know that.
Where's your car?
What are you reading?
You're okay with this?
If you ever say anything about me or about what happens here in this house, to her or anyone -- I will find out.  And you'll never see me again.  Promise me.
This is the greatest moment of your life and you're off somewhere, missing it.
Listen to me.  You have to consider the possibility that God doesn't like you, he never wanted you.  In all probability, He hates you.  This is not the worst thing that can happen...
Six months advance pay.  Six months!
There's fight club in Delaware City.
Hey.
Where did you go, Psycho-Boy?
Why wasn't I involved from the beginning?  You and I started fight club together.
What are you talking about?
You're too young.  Sorry.
Four in Milwaukee.
People think that you're me, because you and I happen to share the same body.
Is this really news to you?
You have jobs.
...go through with this? What are you going to do?
...to let this happen!
What are you doing running through the streets in your underpants?  We both use that body.
Tyler...
Ask me nicely.
Defuse the bomb?
Can't you call it off... ?
Please...
What the fuck -- ?
NO...
Why can't I get rid of you?  Why can't I just wish you away?
No, no, I don't.  I thank you, I really do.  Thank you, but I don't need you anymore.
If I leave, you will be right back where I found you...
What are you doing?
Appreciate something.
Who is this?
Did I tell you I'd call you a fascist dickhead?!
Who told you motherfuckers you could use my place?
What are you doing?!
Is this a picture of Mom and Dad?
Biology, mostly.
The survivors of Flight 180 died in the exact order they were originally meant to die in the plane crash. That was Death's original design.
The second one just dies.  A 16 year old kid.
Six duds in a row.
This makes no sense.  Isabella was supposed to crash her van into a lake.  Could we have altered her destiny when we had her arrested?
Freaked me out so bad I hid in a shopping cart for four hours. 'Course, missed the show...
Dano, shouldn't we stop and help your mother?
Tell me you didn't start up on that Flight 180 shit again.  Did you?
What?
Are you Jorge Cruz?
We had a fight.  Some things got broken, the dog went crazy, she left me.  Wouldn't say where she was going.
Take a guess.
Last July I dialed a wrong number and got a radio station by accident. They asked me what number means "good luck" in Jewish.
What's going on here?
THAT's the truck that's going to kill everyone!
Do you remember what triggered it all?
You mean Alex Browning.
I know.  I've gotten calls all morning from everyone who was on the onramp. We're all meeting at my apartment tonight.
I didn't.  Until I was dispatched to clean up one of the Flight 180 survivors.
This is cheery.
Shit, I don't have her number.  She was never interviewed.  She took off right after the accident.
Kalarjian?
Welcome back.  We did it.  For real.
For God's sake, leave him alone, Dad.
What is it?  What are you?
More than that.  All the songs on the radio were about car crashes. Some kid's banging toy cars together.  She was dialing her cell phone with her headset on.  His car was leaking oil all over the road.
Relax, Dad.  It's Daytona, not Mongolia.
You're all certifiable, you know that?  I can't believe I've been listening to this crap.  Come on, Tim, let's go outside.
Mom?
You think the tooth fairy's gonna come tonight?  I'm thinkin' like fifteen bucks.
How would I know? You think I'm some sort of...
I'm not just layin' down a bunch of math here, with this. I'm talking about indications... omens... that day, that we were meant to die. That, if, we have been aware of... would have saved everyone on the plane.
I don't understand... did you see Tod die? Did it happen again, like on the plane?
Those guys are probably fifteen minutes away.
You're payin' for my trip, Browning!
We're losing our favorite teacher.
Is knowing going to make it easier? It makes it harder.
I believe that... Ms. Lewton's next.
I'm sorry we broke in.
It broke!
He didn't say nothin'. Just drive.
Knock it off!
SHUT UP, BILLY!
Sorry, I mean... I talk to people all the time... I know a lot of them aren't there.  But this is real, isn't it?  You're taking me home now?
Hell.  This is just like fucking Star Wars, man!
... and there's this guy with a black helmet and cape, right, and he's got this sword... except it's not a sword, it's light...
Batteries not included.
What's this?
I was in the brig.  They gave me a deal.  I blew up this Colonel's golf cart with an M-19.  He wasn't in it or anything... it was the symbolic value.  Seemed like a good idea at the time.
Why would they send us to a deserted camp?
How you doing, Brewer?
Brewer!  You know what that thing's packing?
You're gonna love it.
Intelligence work.
Where's Nguyen now?  What city?
It's nice there.  He's probably digging every minute.  Got a surfboard.  Breaking girls' hearts.
Are you okay?
Yes you can.
Look, Co...
Alternate LZ Zulu Sierra at 0500. It says "May have heat.  Don't be late.  All our love."
That's an order.
Where?
How long before you're fully on line?
It's not necessary.
I know...
Congressional Medal of Honor.
Plus, what else?  Two Silver Stars, four Bronze Stars, two Soldier's Medals, four Vietnamese Crosses of Gallantry and... uh, a handful of Purple Hearts.
What did you want?
I like your nails.  Where did you get them done?
...My mother calls every week. Like a recurring nightmare. "So, have you met anyone?"..."No mom".. "So what's going to happen?"... "I don't know Mom"... I only thank God I moved out.
I think some people are meant to be alone.  Maybe I was a man in a former life and I used women for pleasure so now I'm paying for it - which would be fine, if I could just remember some of the pleasure parts... 
Oh, no..I have to get home...
It happens to be a beautiful love story.  Ya know, you used to like that about me.  You used to say you liked that I didn't make you think so much.  That we could be together and not think...
I get this feeling like I'm... a magnet but I attract shit.  Out of all the people in this city, why did I meet a man who's wife I killed?
Lydia?!  Lydia who!?
... I don't get a friggin' phone call.  You stroll in here at noon.  I got... two people out sick.  Ya think I need this?  I Do Not Need This!
All right... Sorry... I feel indebted to him.
See, I told you!
I don't know... He's a little disgusting... Although some women go for that.
What are you two up to?
What?
Bullshit!  If you're going to hurt me, you hurt me now -- not some long... drawn out hurt that takes weeks of my life because you don't have the balls!
Yeah, but does she swallow, Edwin?
Can you tell me something? Did you lose your mind all of a sudden or was it a slow gradual process?
Um...I've got to run. I've bee doing this all day.  Are you going to be all right?
They're putting me on film tomorrow.
Yes.
Which ones?
Now what?
Free?
Okay... twenty dollars... When can you...
... Do you know who I am?
The Holy Grail?  Some billionaire has the Holy Grail sitting in a commode on Madison Avenue?
Why did you do that?
That's O.K.
Will you shut-up!!!
I'm self-centered, I'm weak - I don't have the will power of a <u>fly</u> on shit...
He knows who you are!  He's afraid!  I can tell!
Listen, he just needs to sleep it off. Someone will take care of him.
It's such a great song.
Will you stand still so I can do this!
In a bar called Hellfire.
...I feel so much for her...I feel like something awful is going to happen.
You can't leave me tied up out here alone, you fucking faggot!
...I..uh..I get to read some of the books but mostly I..just calculate production costs from first edition hard cover publication to paperback. After paperback it's basically someone else's problem.
What do you do - for a living I mean?
What are we about to do?
I don't drink coffee...
Excuse me...
Well, id'n that nice.
Is it my turn again?
Come on. We're goin' over to Elton's.
You just going to sit there?
Okay. Hope no one hits on you.
I'm sorry.
Sssh, come on now...  Be a good girl.
Sure...
Bye, honey, I'll call you in a couple of days.
Come on.
We'll get off in Washington and hook another ride.
Alaska.
No. We have tomatoes.
What do you mean, you don't have side orders of toast? You make sandwiches, don't you?
One Number Two, and a chicken sal san -- hold the butter, the mayo, the lettuce -- and a cup of coffee... Anything else?
She says you're the one that sells all the cars on TV.
You always do this to me.
I have to talk seriously with you...
It's not funny. He permanently sprained his neck, and since then it's been extremely difficult for him to tuck the violin.
He's not... They feel he... maybe he might not recover, and that he'll either...
Yeah... I guess so...
He has ways of communicating, Robert. I can tell when he's expressing approval or disapproval, just from his eyes...
Oh no... Why? What is it? The way I look?
I probably am, but I don't care. I mean, I wasn't that blessed to begin with, and when would I have had time to make any improvements...
Look, can't you see that, what I'm talking about?
Swimming?
I love to swim, and I don't mind the cold at all. It's invigorating.
That's right. Have you anything to suggest?
Right now I'm going to run a hot tub and soak myself.
After that, I plan to read some music and rest for awhile.
You don't call that music, though.
Wait...
What?
No inner feeling.
No, I can't...
No. It's useless, Robert. It wouldn't work, not ever...
And living out here, in this rest home asylum, that's what you want?
She's tremendously gifted, this girl.
I hope you feel at home, Robert.  I'm really glad you're here.
I've walked across a stage a number of times, without exciting any particular response...
You've been staying in a motel all this time?
I don't understand why you had to stay in a motel. There's more than enough room here.
Don't call me "mack," honey.
Mass production is what does it.
The choice of words, "squashed flat," juxtaposed against the image of a fluffy kitten...
If you want to call it that.
Fine.
God, you drive me crazy. I just want you to know how I feel and you don't understand.
Who are you?
Do you have a name?
Yo.
So watcha doin'?
What are you doin' here?
Oh you know, cleaned the house, cooked. Took care of my little sisters. Sit down. So where's Carlos?
So you got a girl?
So what's her name?
So wadda you do with your girls?
That's it?
I look good, that's it. So what else do you do for these girls?
Well, you know I'm standin' here and you say I look good?
No you didn't, you ain't provin'it.
Eddie from Compost?
Why?
They are?
Where you goin'?
I gotta go take a piss.
Yo, remember from the pool, that girl?
The one with the phat ass?
A bad attitude.
Now salsa, you know how to dance salsa?
You here to see somebody?
Yo, that's my girl.
You sure?
You wanna do somethin' with me?
God I admire you.
Yes sir, you are confirmed on Flight 306 to Rio tomorrow evening at 11 PM. First Class.
Maybe tonight?
Fletch!
Fletch F. Fletch
For a gentleman who was just found holding a bag full of heroin...
'Your men' might just be involved in all this.
Ask anybody.
Speaking of which, you're not going to print anything before my investigation is through, are you?
What the hell are you doing here?
So where do you know Alan from?
Two bs?
Margaret.
Oh really, there's no need to -- we don't want to do that...
I'm sure it's not for a lack of looking. Maybe I should get a real complete physical. You give Alan an annual, don't you?
Jesus.
It's me doctor Rosenpenis. I just have to take another peek at Alan Stanwyk's file. What have they done with this place?
Can I get you something?
I did not break nor enter. I simply chose an advisable location to await my client's delinquent husband.
Bravo, Mr. Fletcher.
And what was that?
I'm Harry S. Truman from Casewell Insurance Underwriters.
I really creamed the sonofabitch, didn't I?
I couldn't sit home and play the mournful widow anymore, and the police didn't need me, so I tried watching a Lakers game on TV, but the announcer talked to fast and I couldn't understand a lot of what was happening, so I figured if I came down here maybe you could explain the rules to me, and besides, I missed you.
I'm the Sufi.
Sure you did.
That's Brazil.
We can't talk about it here.
Because we can't.
I want you to come to my house. Then we'll talk.
I'll give you a thousand dollars cash just to come to my house and listen to the proposition. If you reject the proposition, you keep the thousand, and your mouth shut.
Alan Stanwyk.
Did it ever occur to you that I might not want to kill you?
I'm still here.
What's the difference? The noise'll kill you first.
Do you have a passport?
Yes. All you provide are the gloves, the passport, and the aim. I'll take care of everything else.
Will you kill me?
'Magic' today, huh?
Did you say cops?
Cute young thing, too.
Of course, his wife's name is Sally Ann Cavanaugh?
Do you happen to have a picture of Alan and his wife?
Oh, that's all right, I've got lots more. Want to see the reception?
What are you asking me for? He's so busy lately I hardly see him. And he's been so preoccupied.
Hi.
Uh... I'm just out of the shower.
'But we're alone now, and I'm singing this song for you.'
Can I ask you a question?
Thanks for the great time.
I'll cover it. You have any other surprises?
What are you talking about?
Wait a second. What am I supposed to do for twenty-four hours?
What's wrong, Gail?
Are you telling me my husband is a bigamist???
I'm terrified.
Don't worry, I can take it.
Would you care for a drink while you're waiting? I can put it on the Underhill bill.
Hi, where's Mrs. Stanwyk?
Oh, that's right. She told me to meet her there. That's cabana six?
Right. Tell you what -- have you caviar?
The door was unlocked.
No wonder.
What did you want under the bed?
I'm calling the cops. This is for the cops.
I will, Frank, I will. Something came up, okay?
Now, Irwin, try to follow me. You can't run the ad and then not run the story.
Very possibly. Come on, say yes. I'll buy you a shirt.
Not really.
Oh, Margie, sorry, Frieda lost the number of Alan's realtor in Provo. Can you give it to me real quick?
And, I'm sorry, who are you again?
Who's Frieda?
You don't know the Underhills?
I just stepped out of the shower! Can you give me a minute?
But I ain't got you...
Ford Fairlane, I'm Colleen Sutton and I need your help.  I have a problem and it pertains to the music industry.  What is it they call you?  Mr. Rock and...
Sorry about the glass.  And the house.  And the breath.
Oh, that!  Don't take it personally. He always wakes up before I do. Down boy!  Roseanne Barr naked!
Now that we've broken the ice...
So you know about Johnny Crunch and myself.
Jonathan was such a beautiful man. No one knew him like I did... Excuse me.  I can't do this now. I'll call you tomorrow.
I ask you to find a girl and instead you steal a C.D. from me. Ford.  You suck.
Zuzu Petals!  Did she have it?
Did she tell you anything?
So many assholes, so few bullets.
I've heard cars fuck with more harmony.
Julian's happy as long as he doesn't see glass shatter.
Hey, Don, how's the high blood pressure.
You wish.
Quiet.  Tell me you tapped in the police computer and found out lots of good stuff about Art Mooney...
Tonight after I see Don. Some Beverly Hillbilly just hired me to find you-know-fucking-who. Name's Colleen Sutton.
Sorry, Jazz.  After this, I'll throw a burger down your throat, okay?
A fucking C.D.  Wow, this case is closed.  So, she's got bad taste in music and in men... Did I tell you she and Johnny were lovers and that they were into something and he got killed for it?
What did you... Hey, where's your spex?
Hello, Ford...
Without Grendel knowing about it. B-I-N-G-O and Bingo was his name-O. Counterfeit C.D.s.  Tape piracy has graduated to disc piracy, the sound quality's better, and so's the money.
Thanks.  You interested.  It's festival seating, so...
Three hundred.
Hello?
Zuzu Petals, you're not bad.  In fact, I was discussing this whole rock-n-roll thing with my pal Art Mooney the other day.  You know him?
Yeah, it's weird.  Bobby and Johnny were such good friends...
Why are you depressed?  You get in all the clubs, you never pay cover...
Nice left you got there, jerk.
Suck a dick, I left my purse...
Hey.  God.  You're an asshole.
I can't kill this kid's father...
Hello, Mr. Tongue!  What a perv.
So, Zuzu.  Are you okay?
Who cares?  I got a case.
This ain't no social call.  One hundred bucks.  To find my father.
Fuck that, I mean, the heck with that.  I kicked their ass!  Well, I tried.  There were two of them you know...
It's me.
Hey, I love you, too, you little jerk.  Jesus, guy tries to make a commitment and he's gotta eat shit.
If you're hiding something... oh, oh, I'll have so much fun.
'Booty Time.'
Like me.
'It's booty time, it's booty time, across the U.S.A.  It's booty time...'
Have a problem, call Ford Fairlane.  He won't solve your case, but who cares, you'll be dead in a couple days anyway. Let's face it.  After today, the California Raisins aren't gonna hire you.
How's it going?
So what did you think of the ballet? Was it like a warm Ice Capades?
Uh, nice piano.  Probably get a lot of complaints from the neighbors -- heh...  It's another time, Julian, another place.  If I told you Bobby Vomit, Johnny Crunch, and Colleen Sutton were the ones you were complaining about, the ones who tried to rip you off, what would your reaction be?
And may I suggest for dessert, the five copies I made...
You heard that Bobby Vomit O.D.'d, right?  Do you suspect foul play and stuff?
Nice getting all those phone calls from you after you hit it big, you Redhook bastard.
How nice.
'Bye, Johnny...
How come there's nothing out there? That stuff is all milk.
I don't know what you're talkin' about.
Man, I'm clean.
Henri c'est gentil d'tre venu.  Je vous prsente mon associ, Pierre Nicoli.  Henri Devereaux.
Everything's smooth.  Beautiful.  I will need a few more days though, the boys think we oughta cool it for awhile -- make sure there's no heat.
Regarde mon pcheur de baleine... Tu sais il va faire trs froid cet hiver.
Mais non, c'est pour toi.
Comment va-t-elle?
Are you sure it is dead?
Il est en retard.
I'm afraid they've become a bit... over-cautious.  Our American friends.
There'll be someone else.
Des Moines.
Yeah!
When ya go back on?
Case?  So far I haven't seen a damn thing.
Never trust a nigger.
Let's popeye around the Chez for a half hour, catch the end of the show and a couple drinks.
Who is that guy?
What the hell am I drivin' for? I'm a first grade Detective. You're a second grade guinea.
The guy's a frog -- I'm pretty sure. Also he made me.  Stayin' on four but went up to six -- cute.
Hey, Bo.
Where'd you get this fag shit?
It was a crematorium.
Yeah.
Let me tell you what I know, Daryl.  You went to Saint Xavier with Mary.  You lived five blocks from her.  You liked her.  But she ain't interested.  That must've hurt, huh?
Oh, man.  Hope it ain't like this in Baltimore tomorrow.
How about a little of the King?
He did.
Where's Johnny?
I love you, Bud.
415 Greenwich St.  #302.  Under the body of a murdered woman.
The next batter, Clendenon, hits one outta the park.
Where are you transmitting from?
...WB2YXB calling unidentified station, Queens.  CQ 15.
You call your son Little Chief?
Is this some kind of joke?  Gordo is that you?  Are you fucking with me?
You're telling me your name is Frank Sullivan, you live in Queens and you just saw the first game of the '69 Series...live?
Oh my god.
That's impossible.
Yeah, that's how Hams work.
Thirty-five?  That would make it...
No, not yet.
You're still my Little Chief, right?
What's that?
No wait, don't go!
What are you talking about?
Why?
That can't be...that's not gonna happen.
Dad, you there?  You okay?
What?  What is it?
What kinda twisted animal.
Got it.
How?
Hey, what about the Amazin's?  They pull it off?
John, say hello to my wife...Julia.
Please, Dad, just do it.
I got it.
Dad, what the hell is going on?
John, you there?
I'm not your uncle, kid.  Gordo, what are you doing here?
My father didn't die in a fire?
You're not looking too good.
That's what we need here, Satch.  A lucky break.
Our lucky break.  Mario ID'd the dental. Mary Finelli...reported missing April 16, 1968.
Which means he probably knew her.
I ran him through BCI...got a hit. Busted for sexual assault: March 22, 1970.  Eight days after the last Nightingale murder.
He ain't our guy, John.
I'm sure everything'll work out.  She really loves you...
Fine.  You know Dr. Schwartz retired last month?
My six year-old here keeps telling me he wants to be a policeman.  Right after he retires from the majors.  We just gave him a badge and a whistle for his birthday.
Then I'll bet she's real proud of you, huh?
You're all just jealous.
What're you gonna do?
How about a roll in the hay?
How do we do it?
I'm a slow eater.
What are they saying?
What's this?
Derek... stop.
This door was open just a minute ago, wasn't it?
Let's spread out and check all the rooms.  Outside, too.  You stay with me.
You know, I'm not sure I could live anywhere else.  The nights are always so peaceful and quiet.
I don't know.  I don't see you for months on end, and when I do, you put this wall between us.  How do I break through?
Hi.
In that little thing?
Is... is everything all right?
Are they following us?
What?
Oh, jeez.
Better get out the Hefty Bags... Looks like our boy desperately wants us to believe his story.
....with a woman's touch.
Come on, Dad.  You could have Rick drive down Cunningham Road and look for them.
So what are ya drawin'?
There...Ya happy?
Are you sure this is gonna work? I mean, why didn't we bring that gun and just blast him away?
So what happened?
...Good.  So no more bad dreams can come around here, huh?
So where's Cort gone off to?
Hi.  Everything's all right now. We're here.
I just realized something. Where's Cort?  I haven't seen him for hours.
With extreme car, for God's sake. If that kid is with her, there's every good chance he'll do something crazy.
No, I --
Steven buggin' you?
Everything'll work out.  Trust me on that.
You're talking about my lady.
Tell me.
Steven, c'mon, we're not thirteen...
Yeah, well somebody fucked her and if I find out it was you, I'm gonna come over there and shoot you in the head.
Randy, c'mon!
She asked me to come over.  She said she had something to tell me.
You call what you did bad?!  You knocked her up and then left her!
My God...you are one sorry son-of-a- bitch.
Steven!
But she might be in trouble...
He's undefeated, you know that?  Julius is the only senior I'd even consider doing it with. If he wasn't black, that is.
No thanks.
Right.
Which cabin is Rennie in, Mr. McCulloch?
Christ...where's Rennie??
Where did you get that alcohol?
I'm her legal guardian, not you or anybody else, and I alone know what's best for her. End of discussion.
What are you doing??
Everything okay?
Maybe not. But you're not telling me everything, are you?
Did you have an accident in the lake?
I've got the numbers.
I heard you weren't coming.
What about you?
But Rennie...
Rennie...what'd they do to you??
I used to drive a taxi.
I wrapped my sandwiches in tinfoil. I ate and drove. I had one of those big checkered cabs.
A lovely piece of theater. Small but important.
How is Lillian? I haven't seen her.
We must abandon.
Tonight. What's tonight?
And he was there?
The man has taken over my mind. He's not only out there. He's in my head and I can't get rid of him. I can't write a word without imagining his response. I'm paralyzed as an artist.
We were thinking of putting in a pool.
Had to be him.
Of course I saw it.
This could be it.
Does it feel comfortable?
What about her?
Because we're completely mismatched.
Do you want to get some coffee?
Because you refuse to believe she's serious. You've always refused.
What will we talk about?
What else?
Knowing who a person is. Down deep.
I've been talking to a prominent divorce lawyer.
I went because you went. You smoked because I smoked.
There may be things you'd rather not know about.
Alma Wetzel.
I am really, deeply sorry.
This could be it!
It's a constant shock to me, how small this place is. How did we do it? Five people in these little rooms.
Hey, Pop. I know you don't like the commotion of opening night. But I especially want you to see this play. It's new territory for me. And for you too. I have to know what you think.
You're suppose to wear it when your back gives you trouble.
I'm looking at you trying to think. Put your face in the mirror. I know I recognize you from somewhere.
You're charming the boy.
Go on, tell him. Tell the truth. Tell him how you feel, shooting a piece of hot metal in somebody's flesh who was once a child, who was once the same age as this boy. Somebody's flesh who was innocent once.
You're a family man, Frankie?
It's a complicated subject.
You're afraid to risk believing. Believe in them. Believe in your self. Take a risk. It will humanize you as a person.
Then say it.
This is something no one has been privileged to see in almost seventy years. Very few people now alive can say that they have seen what you are about to see, Matthew. The Red Sox win a World Series. This is deeply, intensely personal. All the mistakes I've made, all the envy, fear and violence that's encased in this little envelope we call a person -- all washed away in the next few minutes. And your grandmother knows why.
They're my team.
I was six years old the day Pesky hesitated throwing home and Slaughter scored all the way from first. That's when I knew the Red Sox were my team. Pity and terror.
I hate the Mets.
And the Father replies?
I was all noise. Played the radio loud. Battled constantly with my brother and sister. Here I am, world.
Is it true?
He wears a disguise.
But you don't even know me. How can you care what I do with whom?
What? Come on, Paisley.
Yes. I've seen your victims. One past and one future. I thought I might convince you to reconsider.
Here, you see? Even the South African papers apologize -- "a monstrous attack."
No -- prison is rather agreeable to me, and there is no doubt that after the war, independence will come. My only worry is what shape it will take. Jinnah has --
"...what shape it will take." Jinnah has -- what?
No violence, please.
What are you doing?
They're calling you "Bapu." I thought it meant father.
...and I knew something had to give. And I was determined to be here when it did.
You mean Gandhi?
What'd he say?
We only make wild speeches, or perform even wilder acts of terrorism. We've bred an army of anarchists but not one single group that can really fight the British anywhere.
Fortunately such news comes very slowly where I live.
What can we do?
They are only clinging to old dreams  and trying to split us in the old way. But the will has gone -- Independence will drop like a ripe apple. The only question is when  and how.
Without a paper -- a journal of some kind -- you cannot unite a community.  You belong to a very important profession.
Do you find me stubborn?
The honor is ours. May I introduce Mr. Kallenbach. He's an old friend  and his interest is in flowers. I presumed to tell him he could wander your gardens while we talked.
Hm. Of course it is not quite that simple.
Good. Good.  I have thought of calling for a Royal Commission to "investigate" the new legislation.  I think I could guarantee they would recommend the Act be repealed.
...There's been no time to keep figures, but there must be ninety -- a hundred thousand under arrest.  And it still goes on.
Ah -- we should invite Gandhi. What the devil has happened to him anyway?
You almost sound like you believe that.
Who are you trying to convince?
Is there any reason you'd want a left-handed child?
We're in the wrong place.  We're wasting time.
That's the last.
We don't have the manpower.
We found his spit in the dead director's eye. He's signed a confession--supplied us with the suit he wore on the night.  What more do you want?
Twelve have a mission within the week.
At least it's nothing contagious.
That's where we get rid of the traces of him although we never truly succeeded.
German.
What about this?
It needs work.
You really need that much?
God, what <i>wouldn't</i> you do to leave the planet?
What an act of benevolence--a service to the community.  So that's it.  Now there's nothing between you and ignition.
It's all right.
Call German.
We can't stay here.
What makes them think that?
--You don't understand, they'll make the connection, they'll hoover again.  We should cut our losses.
And keep your lashes on your lids where they belong.  How could you be so careless?
So it's not just the Hoovers who've got you rattled.
You're not thinking of telling her, are you?
Thank you.
First, we may as well decide on gender. Have you given it any thought?
You've already specified blue eyes, dark hair and fair skin.  I have taken the liberty of eradicating any potentially prejudicial conditions - premature baldness, myopia, alcoholism and addictive susceptibility, propensity for violence and obesity--
I understand.  That's already been taken care of.  Now you appreciate I can only work with the raw material I have at my disposal but for a little extra...I could also attempt to insert sequences associated with enhanced mathematical or musical ability.
What do you think?
He has the heart of an ox.  He could run through a Goddamn wall--if he could still run. Actually, he was a big college swimming star.
Perhaps we ought to celebrate, Irene.
It's here.  My heart.  I'm careful--weekly check-ups.  I'm on a drug maintenance program, blood thinners, diet--  I just want you to know what you'd be getting yourself into.
--when you go away.
Jerome...never shy.  Pisses on command. You've got a beautiful cock.  I ever told you that, Jerome?
If everything goes to plan, this could be the last time I see you for a while.  One week to go.  Please tell me you're the least bit excited.
What's this, Lamar?
You gotta be kidding.
What about them?
Sure,  You're working on the passports...  ... and visas?
Hello, McCoy.
What about your wife?
A little more was taken out before.  My brother's a director of that Bank, Mr. McCoy... I had a few pressing debts.
Close... but it takes a hell of a lot more than promises to pull the kind of strings I pulled.
What's Beynon got set up?
Just like old times?
Half a million.
You go out much?
I guess I'm kind of...
Wait... give me a minute.
How was it?
Yeah, well, I think I'll stick with what I've got.
$250,000 right off the top.
That doesn't hurt.
I didn't. I just waited.
I feel like the night before the first day of school.
You know I've actually gotten tired waiting sometimes... worn out waiting.
Why?
Tell me about Beynon's ranch.
Why didn't you tell me?
Yeah.
A man helped me open it...
There better be a guy with the
Your kind of mistakes are going to land me back in Huntsville.
I'll bet you can.
Do you mean that?
From now on you just shut up and do as you're told.
Where are you going?
Are you hungry?
Do what I tell you, it's not a game.
I want to say something.
We got this far.
I always thought jails make people hard. Not you. You're just not tough enough to forget about Beynon. I chose you, not him.
Ten. Laughlin's going to take us across at four A.M.
Are we going to make it?
That's right.
No, I'm not.
Can I help you?
All right. Shells?
Gonna knock down a wall?
One-inch stuff on a three-number combination.
How about if I buy your car for ten grand?
You're going to have to walk back to the border.
The three of us are going to do some traveling. We're going to take your car to El Paso.
Hello, Jack,  I don't know anything, Jack.
Do you want to be dead, Albert?
You know what the bloody time is!  It's two o'clock in the bloody morning!
A new venture of mine. It's going to be a restaurant.  Do you like it?
Five grand. It belongs to you. Along with a little name I'm going to give you.
You shouldn't have shown the film to Frank.
Who paid you to see me off?
Everyhing go off all right?
But he was just another feller, wasn't he?
Why'd you see him so regular?
You know Sid Fletcher?
I know him too.
Yes, while he was here.
To the demon king's castle, of course.
He must have been pretty sure I'd come.
And what was that?
I want to give you an Oscar.
Tell me about the girl.
The young girl. Who pulled her?
Is it one of Kinnear's films?
And you didn't know her last name?
Look, look.  Get your suit cleaned.
Thanks for coming.
Oh, what you doing now?
That must be interesting.
Where you going to live, then?
Where's that?
Good. I'm off tomorrow, so I don't suppose I'll see you again.  There. Go and get your hair done.
How'd you know Albert?
See you later.
Ah, Edna, come in. Join the tea set.
Stuff it! My girl friend's coming from Liverpool tonight.  Nice surprise, isn't it?
I won't be using the room tonight.
Don't be bloody silly. You're the first since Monday.
Ta.
Is he staying the night?
What'll they do to him?
What about Keith?
What you going to do?
Oh, that's nice.
Oh, I'm straight.  Respectable.
Jack! I didn't like that.
Yes, I can see your problem, Mr Kinnear.
Scotch, please.
Nasty way to go.
Of course, of course. Well, any time, just drop by.
Bollock naked with his socks still on?
Oh... I think I'll stay as I am.
I'll see you, then.
All of 'em.  They, hey: it happens to us all.
You had to, yeah.  Why?
You get those names come up, you ever get 'em, "Patel?"
You did?
It is.
...that's right...
For some sales pro...
Who?
Yes.  It is.  It is simple, and you know what the hard part is?
He made up those rules, and we're working for him.
What could somebody get for them?
We're just "talking" about it.
You're actually talking about this?
You're going to steal the leads?
Did I say that?
Yes.
What?  What?  The leads.
Oh, yes, George.
Why?  Why, because you only told me about it?
Well, well, well, talk to me, we sat down to eat dinner, and here I'm a criminal...
Why?
I, you know, they should be insured.
Yes.  I'm no fucking good.
Were the leads...
Where were you?
Did they catch...?
That's great.
Who used to say that?
...that's why I came in.  I thought I...
That's what, that's what, that's what I was trying to do.  That's why I came in...I meet gestapo tac...
Excuse me, fella.
Moss...Who told him?
You have a problem?
Roma, would you, I'd like to get some lunch...
You stupid fucking cunt.  You, Williamson...I'm talking to you, shithead...You just cost me six thousand dollars.  Six thousand dollars.  And one Cadillac.  That's right.  What are you going to do about it?  What are you goin to do about it, asshole. You fucking shit.  Where did you learn your trade.  You stupid fucking cunt.  You idiot.  Whoever told you you could work with men?
John...John...John.  Okay.  John. John.  Look:  The Glengarry Highland's leads, you're sending Roma out.  Fine. He's a good man.  We know what he is.  He's fine.  All I'm saying, you look at the board, he's throwing...wait, wait, wait, he's throwing them away, he's throwing the leads away.  All that I'm saying, that you're wasting leads. I don't want to tell you your job. All that I'm saying, things get set, I know they do, you get a certain mindset... A guy gets a reputation.  We know how this...all I'm saying, put a closer on the job. There's more than one man for the... Put a...wait a second, put a proven man out...and you watch, now wait a second--and you watch your dollar volumes...You start closing them for fifty 'stead of twenty- five...you put a closer on the...
...I only...
What is this "you say"?  A deal kicks out...I got to eat.  Shit, Williamson, shit.  You...Moss... Roma...look at the sheets...look at the sheets.  Nineteen eighty, eighty-one...eighty-two...six months of eighty-two...who's there? Who's up there?
Bullshit.  John.  Bullshit.  April, September 1981.  It's me.  It isn't fucking Moss.  Due respect, he's an order taker, John.  He talks, he talks a good game, look at the board, and it's me, John, it's me...
...you talk to Murray...
Marshal the leads...marshal the leads?  What the fuck, what bus did you get off of, we're here to fucking sell.  Fuck marshaling the leads.  What the fuck talk is that? What the fuck talk is that?  Where did you learn that?  In school?  That's "talk," my friend, that's "talk." Our job is to sell.  I'm the man to sell.  I'm getting garbage.  You're giving it to me, and what I'm saying is it's fucked.
Yes.
That's fucked.  That's fucked.  You don't look at the fucking percentage. You look at the gross.
I've seen those leads.  I saw them when I was at Homestead, we pitched those cocksuckers Rio Rancho nineteen sixty-nine they wouldn't buy.  They couldn't buy a fucking toaster.  They're broke, John. They're cold.  They're deadbeats, you can't judge on that.  Even so. Even so.  Alright.  Fine.  Fine. Even so.  I go in, FOUR FUCKING LEADS they got their money in a sock.  They're fucking Polacks, John.  Four leads.  I close two. Two.  Fifty per...
Why?
Of what?
Alright.
I wish I could.
No.
Why?
That's alright.
What happened?
Get 'em to me!
What are you trying to tell me?
Excuse me...
How do you know I made it up?
You said, "You don't make something up unless it's sure to help."  How did you know that I made it up?
What'd you do with the leads?  You want to go in there?  I tell him what I know, he's going to dig up something...You got an alibi last night?  You better have one. What did you do with the leads?  If you tell me what you did with the leads, we can talk.
I sold them to Jerry Graff.
Na, fuck the leads, I'm going home.
Hey, they're fuckin' garbage any case...This whole goddamn...
Shit.
Rick.  Let me tell you.  Wait, we're in the...
Dave...
Williamson, get on the phone, call Mitch...
Fuck her...
"Always be closing..."
...yes...
Oh, Christ.
No...Black Creek.  Yes.  In Florida?
I wanted to speak with you about...
The monthly interview...?
Yes.  Is this something that I can talk ab...
I'm sorry...?
Yeah.
Ricky, I...
Or a piss...?  A great meal fades in reflection.  Everything else gains.  You know why? 'Cause it's only food.  This shit we eat, it keeps us going.  But it's only food. The great fucks that you may have had.  What do you remember about them?
Yes.
Well, let's have a couple more.  My name is Richard Roma, what's yours?
Who did she call?
No, I'm saying you don't include Saturday...in your three days. It's not a business day.
What would have elapsed?
What is?
What's going on here?
No, no.  That's just something she "said." We don't have to do that.
What...?
What...?  Say the words.
What power?
What?
What are the police doing?
You cashed the check?
Mountain View.  Eight units.
Fuck you.
They didn't get the contracts.
I have the stuff from last year's...
Three?  I count two.
Did you see my present for you?
Mr. Cicci.  From the year 1927 to the present time, you were an employee of the &quot;Genco Olive Oil Company.&quot;
But in actuality, you were a member of the Corleone Crime organization.
I have a friend who has a fine rug. Maybe your wife would like it.
Your friend lives in a fine building.
What if we don't pay?
How are you, honey?  You've met Merle, haven't you.  He was with me in Vegas.
Connie, I want to be reasonable with you.  You have a house here, with us.  You can live here with your kids...and you won't be deprived of anything.  I don't know much about Merle; I don't know what he does for a living; what he lives on.  Why don't you tell him marriage is really out of the question; and that you can't see him any more. He'll understand.  But if you disobey me, and marry this pimp...it would disappoint me.
Honey!  Wait a minute; let's go for a drive.
I wanta dance...whatsa matter with that?
You would risk your life for strangers?
Don Francesco.  You murdered my husband, because he would not bend. And his oldest son Paolo, because he swore revenge.  But Vitone is only nine, and dumb-witted.  He never speaks.
He is weak.
The child cannot harm you.
I think there's only two hundred dollars under my hat.  I'm right.  Only two hundred dollars.
It was never Pentangeli... I've always known that.  It was Roth all along.  He talks to me as a son; as his successor, but the old man thinks he'll live forever.
To go tonight, with me, as though we know nothing.  I've already made my move.
I was kept pretty much in the dark. I didn't know all that much.
He said there was something good in it for me...me on my own.
It wasn't the way I wanted it!  I can handle things.  I'm not dumb Christ, not like everyone says. I'm smart; and I want respect.
Why?  Why does he bother other Italians?
For you, she is beautiful.  For me, there is only my wife!
What did I tell you.  The one who cut him was found in an alley.  And the family of the others paid Fanucci all their savings to make him forswear his vengeance.
... He said he had shot his Grandfather with a gun, and then he died in the garden.  And he asked me... he asked me, Tom, if that meant now his father would shoot him out of... revenge.  How does a four year old boy learn the word... 'revenge'?
What kind of a family is this... are we human beings?  He knows his Father killed his Uncle Carlo.  He heard Connie.
Where's my wife?
He doesn't want my help any more. He doesn't need it.
Will you tell him?
It might show.
You're right.
Don't worry about anything, Frankie Five-Angels.
No strings.
There's thirty grand worth of paid off markers -- I never owed that much.
Mr. Hagen, would you kindly identify to this committee that gentleman sitting on your right hand?
Is he related to the witness?
Senator Kane.
Anthony, Daddy's busy.
Does it feel like a boy?
I'm sorry about some of the people I had to see today.  It was bad timing... but it couldn't be helped.
On a plane back to Sicily.
I won't let you leave!  Christ, do you think I'm going to let you leave.
No, I don't want to hear anything. There are things between men and women that will not change; things that have been the same for thousands of years.  You are my wife, and they are my children... and I love you and I will not let you leave, because you are MINE!
If that's what it takes; then yes, I will.
You said you were Klingman.
Alright.  They bother me once in awhile.  Tell me, when Pop had troubles... did he ever think, even to himself, that he had gone the wrong way; that maybe by trying to be strong and trying to protect his family, that he could... that he could... lose it instead?
However I can help you...
Nothing is more important.
I still don't speak Spanish, Michael.
This doubles my investment.
This is it!  We think it makes Vegas look like the corner crap game.
I just left our friend in Miami.
This witness has testified that you are personally responsible for the murder of a New York Police Captain in the year 1947 and with him a man named Virgil Sollozzo.  Do you deny this?
I know.
Okay, now it's my family in Brooklyn; and I wanna keep up Clemenza's loyalty to you.  But how can I run my family with you challenging my every move?  You're too far from the street, Mike, the only way to reason with the Rosato Brothers is to whack 'em and whack 'em fast.
Clemenza promised them nothing, he hated the sonsuvbitches.
Michael, you're sitting up here in the Sierra Mountains with champagne cocktails making judgment on the way I run my family.
I want you to settle these troubles with the Rosato Brothers.
Frankie...do you respect me?  Do I have your loyalty?
My lawyer, Tom Hagen.  He arranged this all through your man Turnbull.
Senator Geary, I speak to you as a businessman who has made a large investment in your state.  I have made that state my home; plan to raise my children here.  The license fee from the Gambling Commission costs one thousand dollars; why would I ever consider paying more?
We're all part of the same hypocrisy, Senator.  But never think it applies to my family.
He don't want to talk?
Don't I look like I'm listening?
You know if there's a way I'll go to the commission and the commission will side with me.  That puts me and the other New York families against you.
I'm talking about Italians!
So what did you think?
It's different.  He's a man.  And by the way you have no business calling him a homo.
It still hurt.  A lot.
No, I'm actually kind of glad it happened.  It made me wonder what the hell I was doing with my life. Letting you pull me into bed whenever the spirit moved you.
Sure.  I loved it.
So you don't want to fuck.  That's what you're telling me?
It's your job, lady, not mine.  I'm here so he can draw my picture.
The Master is dressing.  I am to offer you a drink.  There is whiskey and there is iced tea.
You mean family?  All in Joplin, Missouri.
You're sure of that?
That is why he must go to hell.  I do not think it fair.  But God's law is not for us to judge.
What have you done with him?
The police will not know that. They will want to investigate.
I couldn't help but notice your tattoo.  That phrase?  Death Before Dishonor.  What does it mean?
I'm just a hick who cuts lawns. But some of these look familiar.
"Frankenstein" and "Bride of" and "Son of" and all the rest?
When they stay in your employ too long, servants begin to think they're married to you.  Please, Mr. Boone.  Help yourself.
To an artistic eye, you understand. Have you ever modeled?
You went to university?
You have to excuse me, Mr. Boone. Since my stroke, I am often overcome with nostalgia.
Why?  Was it supposed to be funny?
I'll pay our going rate.  Plus what you'd get if you did the hedges.
Is that why you and your friend split up?  Because you wanted to be free?
You might not think it to look at me now, but there was a time when I was at the very pinnacle of my profession.  The horror movies were behind me.  I'd done "Show Boat." Major success.  Great box office. Now I was to do something important.  "The Road Back."  An indictment of the Great War and what it did to Germany.  It was to be my masterpiece.
I think we all want to feel we've left our mark on the world.  Yes. I wish I had done more work.
What about your stint in Korea? I'm sure it was full of dramatic episodes.
Same difference, Mr. Boone. Disgust, fear of the unknown -- all part of the great gulf that stands between us.  Am I right in assuming that you've had little experience with men of my persuasion?
Oh, there may not be atheists in the foxholes, but there are occasionally lovers.
Barnett.  Was that his name? Leonard Barnett.  He came to the front straight from Harrow.  And he looked up to me.  Unlike the others, he didn't care that I was a workingman impersonating his betters.  How strange, to be admired so blindly.  I suppose he loved me.  But chastely, like a schoolboy.
You will not set me on another walk down memory lane.  Not this lane. Not today.
If you don't mind driving, I'd like to take you as my guest.  There should be lots of pretty starlets to keep you amused.
I'd like to try again.  If you're game.
I never made it to Korea.
-- that I was a Marine.  Which is true.  You filled in the rest.
Them's the breaks, right?  No war stories for this pup.
That's from your movie, right? "The only monsters are here."
But that was so long ago.  It can't still bother you.
You are much too human.
I don't know.
All right.  Let's take it off now.
Just take off the fucking mask!
Boone!  You awake?  Eight o'clock.
Hey, Boone.
Can't say that I have.  Can't say I've heard of a lot of people though.
You're like a dog with a bone over this movie, Clay.
Then take the pills.
I'm sorry, Jimmy.  But with this movie and two difficult stars --
Should you be drinking in your condition?
And you said there'd be some of me left.  Nobody's going to know me in this getup.
How are you feeling, Mr. Jimmy? How is your mind today?
I am not forgetting your last brief chat.
Oh, that monster.  How could you be working with him?
He is not going to kill the old man?
She is horrible.
You will take them all, Mr. Jimmy?
It needs a hat.  There was a wide-brimmed cream fedora...
Mr. Whale, this is such an honor. You're one of my favorite all-time directors.  I can't believe I'm meeting you.
That's my favorite line in my favorite movie of yours.  "Bride of Frankenstein."
Twenty-one.  The romantic comedies and dramas were much more to my liking.  The horror pictures were trifles.  Grand guignol for the masses.
You're serious.
Too warm for a sweater, anyway.
Can we talk about the horror movies now?
Can that count as one question?
My idea.  Muchly.  My sketches. Big heavy brow.  Head flat on top so they could take out the old brain and put in the new, like tinned beef.
What are you doing here?
It's been a long time, Memphis --
It seems she neglected to mention it
You have a Hollandaise sauce ?
Yeah -- ?
It's about my brother ... Kip...
I'm not interested --
Get out --
Well, well. You've caused quite a ruckus ...
Leg's all banged-up. He made a stupid play ... He'll limp around the yard up at Folsom. But Astricky will be there to take care of him. With their priors, they're looking at a serious bounce --
You'll leave -- ?
I remember us having made some kind of deal, Randall. I don't remember this deal having some kind of time-limit. I look at you - here - in my town - and I'm confused...
What's wrong with it -- ?
Okay, then. I'll catch you later, Randall ...
So? Tell me: how come they call you "Freb" anyways -- ?
C'mon, Donny... Let's go, man --
You guys have any skills at all?
For real. Okay. Gimme COLUMBO...
I miss Orville Redenbacher already --
We're on a truncated time-table. Take a day to shop it; a day to prep it ... And we're still going to need to expand the crew...
How are we supposed to--
You look good...
Have you seen him?
Why didn't you tell me?
You getting my checks ... ?
He doesn't return my calls. or my letters ...
And just in case you lose your keys, good sir, I can toss in a complimentary slim-jim, free of charge ...
I know...
Okay, then ... I just go to the Marriott and I'm set ...
We'll take it...
You goin' home?
Sure -
Any more ...
You okay -- ?
I heard you were pumping gas -
You're kind of cultivating a new look.
There's certainly a time and a place for a mellow olive -
So what are you gonna do?
You just got crushed in a car. You're bleeding all over your self. And you sit there - eating olives and talking basketball, as if, at this very moment, people weren't plotting your demise ...
As opposed to now, Kid Car Crusher?
I've missed you, man ...
You remember where you got this Eleanor -- ?
Pop the trunk, Tumbler.
On account of Mitch?
I've taken the spear for a lot of people, Sway. Including you. Can't we improvise a little here ... ?
And you got some Italians -- ?
I'm not doing it anymore. Haven't for a while. I've carved out something for myself. It's pathetic, but it's mine ...
What the hell are you doing -- ?
They only made a handful. We're lucky there's even one living in the area...
You mentioned that in your letters
What the hell's that -- ?
Slip it in ...
Donny got shot ... A jacker ...
Where to -- ?
Whatever do you mean?
I appreciate your dilemma, Memphis. But how are two washed-up thieves and an old man supposed to boost 50 cars in three days...
Anyone? The significance of "Robin 1" on Magnum's license plate? Memphis?
Dinosaurs. All of us. The Ice Age is now...
Okay. All our ladies should be home now, tucked in bed. Let's keep chilly. Think Slow. Any questions?
Uh ... Randall -- ?
Hey, look at him. Tommy. You grew up.
Just stay away from the garbage. Yon know what I mean.
You're only home early because we got you a job, right? And I don't need any heat. You understand?
And, if you hear about anybody else fucking around with that shit, you tell me.
I warned you a million times.
You think I didn't know what you were doing?
Right in my face. You looked in my face and you lied.
Paulie.  You're all I got.  I need help.
I didn't know, I swear.  I thought it was next week.
I Don't know. I don't know if I could live that way. What if, God forbid, you go to prison. Mickey said Jeannie's husband --
I'm gonna need some money.
I thought you were supposed to turn yourself in at ten o'clock this morning?
You son of a bitch. She's been here.
Stop! Stop!
Nobody's helping me. Tommy got four years. Marty and Fran are broke.  I asked your friend Remo for the money he owed you, and you know what he told me?
Yes, you can. I've got it set up. We'll be fine. All I need is for you to keep bringing the stuff. I've got a guy in here from Pittsburgh who'll move it for me. Believe me, in a month we'll be fine. We won't need anybody.
Don't worry with what. You just start looking for a new place. I'm going to Pittsburgh in the morning. The guys from Pittsburgh they owe me fifteen grand from our little partnership and it's only the beginning.
Who's gonna do that?
What are you talking about?
What happened? You okay?
What are we going to do with him? We can't dump him in the street.
Keep 'em coming.
The guy just sold the property. They're gonna build condominiums and I don't want anybody digging up the little bastard.
Give'm a drink.
I better call again.
Whadda you mean, you can't make any more deliveries? You're going to fuck up everything?
Do you realize what we're involved in here now?
Tommy.  Come on. Relax.
You gotta help me. Okay? This girl I told you about? Diana? She's from the Five Towns. She's Jewish. She won't go out with me alone. Can you believe this shit? She's fucking prejudiced, but she's built. She's never been out with an Italian before. She says she'll only go out on a double date with her girlfriend.  You believe this shit? But you gotta see her. I mean, she's beautiful.
Tommy, come on. Put the gun away.
Are you okay? What happened?
How is he? Okay? Are they busting his chops?
He didn't call?
He's got your father upset. Good thing he doesn't have to go to work in the morning. Is this what he deserves?
Someday they'll get what's coming to them. That's the only way they'll stop.
Well you know how he loves animals right? Anyway, last week he's drivin' home... 
Two weeks? That's nothin'. My Uncle Marty? Will knows him. That guy fuckin' drinks like you've never seen! One night he was drivin' back to his house on I-93-- Statie pulls him over.
--Yah, restructurin' the amount of retards they had workin' for them.
Stop brushin' me back!
Who'd you call?
I didn't get on Cathy last night.
I don't know what the fuck you're doin'. You're givin' us a ride.
Suck my crank. Fuckin' sheet metal pussy.  So, when are you done with those meetin's?
Look, you're my best friend, so don't take this the wrong way, but in 20 years, if you're livin' next door to me, comin' over watchin' the fuckin' Patriots' games and still workin' construction, I'll fuckin' kill you. And that's not a threat, that's a fact. I'll fuckin' kill you.
Why didn't you yoke him?
You're kiddin' me.
Hi.
I guess so.
Is this a bad time?
I just wanted to find out what was going on...But now that I'm here it seems strange, doesn't it?
--That isn't funny--
Yah, that is a nice ass.
Morgan, I'm not goin' to "Kelly's Roast Beef" just cause you like the take-out girl. It's fifteen minutes out of our way. MORGAN What else we gonna do we can't spare fifteen minutes?
How much money you got?
Come on, Will...
My uncle can probably get you on my demo team.
It's a good thing no one's Irish here.
What class did you say that was?
So why do you think I should work for the National Security Agency?
Please, I'm a professor here and it's very important.
Oh, I'm sorry.
What's that?
Oh, for God's sake, Will.
Then don't set up any more meetings.
Well, I'm sorry.
Excuse me, Professor Lambeau?
How about Gerald Lambeau? Ever heard of him?
So who won the bet?
He's from Southie? How many people did you try before you came to me?
Not Rick? You didn't send him to Rick?
Can we do it at my office?
What do you mean "he didn't talk?" You sat there for an hour?
Why would he do that?
You're here quite a bit, then.
Jobs doing what?
That's great, Gerry, that there's interest-- But I'm not sure he's ready for that.
You see, Sean? That's exactly not the point. No one remembers that. They--
Just...take it easy, Gerry.
--No, no you hear me out, Sean. This young man is a true prodigy--
--And here I am for the second week in a row with my professional reputation at stake--
He has a gift and with that gift comes responsibility. And you don't understand that he's at a fragile point--
--Is that what this is about, Sean? The Field's Medal? Do you want me to go home and get it for you? Then will you let the boy--
So I hear you're taking some time.
Why there?
About thirty million to one.
What happened?  You got fired, huh?
There goes that fuckin' Barney right now, with his fuckin' "skiin' trip." We should'a kicked that dude's ass.
Will, I can't believe you brought Skylar here when we're all wrecked. What's she gonna think about us?
No, but, I mean you know...I do other things. That no one knows about.
Who is "Danny Terrio?"
Well, I can see this is pointless...
Free weights. WILL Oh yeah? Me too. What do you bench?
What does?
Why not?
Well, I've read you colleagues. Your book was good, Sean.  All those guys were in your platoon?
When did you know she was the one?
I just slid my ticket across the table and said "sorry fellas, I gotta go see about a girl."
Someone who challenges you in every way. Who takes you places, opens things up for you. A soul-mate.
They're all dead.
It's not about that job. I'm not saying you should work for the government. But, you could do anything you want. And there are people who work their whole lives layin' brick so their kids have a chance at the kind of opportunity you have. What do you want to do?
Gotta go with the belt there...
I know.
I just want you to know, Sean...
I'll keep in touch.
Well, look, I have to go. Gotta' get up early and waste some more money on my overpriced education.
I was trying to be smooth.  But at twelve-fifteen I was gonna come over there and talk to you.
Yeah?
Sounds good, where are you now?
No I wasn't...
How many?
It was great. There was always someone to play with, give you advice.
'Course I do, they're my brothers.
I want to meet them.
I couldn't wait till tomorrow.
What if I said I wouldn't sleep with you again until you let me meet your friends?
How's it goin'?
Have you ever studied Organic Chemistry?
Do you play the piano?
I'm trying to explain it to you. So you play the piano. When you look at the keys, you see music, you see Mozart.
Will? Are you awake?
Come with me to California.
Why won't you come with me? What are you so scared of?
I inherited that money when I was thirteen, when my father died.
Yes I do. Did you ever think that maybe I could help you? That maybe that's the point, that we're a team?
Twenty days work, oh boy!
Go on. Get in your tent. You don't know nothin'.
Ain't you gonna look back, Ma?--give the ol' place a last look?
That don't sound like you, Ma. You never was like that before.
Ready, Ma?
Maybe. Maybe twenny days work, maybe *no* days work. We ain't got it till we get it.
Lots must a died, too.
We just picked him up on the way in. He went away this mornin' when the rate dropped.
Two and a half cents.
Take it or leave it. There's 200 men coming from the South that'll be glad to get it.
I don't mean to be nosy, y'understand. I just got to have certain information. What's your name?
We got the best dances in the county every Saturday night.
That cut you got?
But you wasn't a preacher. A girl was just a girl to you. But to me they was holy vessels. I was savin' their souls.  I ast myself--what *is* this call, the Holy Sperit? Maybe *that's* love. Why, I love everybody so much I'm fit to bust sometimes!  So maybe there ain't no sin an' there ain't no virtue. There's just what people do. Some things folks do is nice, and some ain't so nice. But that's as far as any man's got a right to say.
Course I'll say grace if somebody sets out the food--  --but my heart ain't in it.  Nice drinkin' liquor.
Been out travelin' around?
Lissen. This wind's fixin't to *do* somepin'!
Your granma was a great one, too. The third time she got religion she go it so powerful she knocked down a full-growed deacon with her fist.
This used to be mine. I give it to Grampa when I went away.  You reckon they could be dead?
She's settlin'.
How about us? Is that the truth for us?
He seen you, Tom! You wanta be fingerprinted? You wanta get sent back for breakin' parole?
I'll tell 'em. But I don't know how. Never seen so many guys with guns. Wouldn't even let us talk today.
Fella named Spencer sent us--said they was work pickin' peaches.
What's the matter? What's happened?
Goin' far?
Been doin' a job?
You ain't got to get sore.
Well, maybe. But I'd hate to be doin' it. Takes more nerve than I got.
*Ain't* a-goin'... ain't a-goin'...
Got any plants?
Ma... all this, will it hurt the baby?
Don't it ever scare you it won't be nice in California like we think?
You an' me's goin' together--jus' you an' me. We're a-goin' to that dance an' we're a-goin' to jus' set an' watch. If anybody says to come dance--why I'll say you're poorly. But you an' me, we're gonna hear the music an' see the fun.
How 'bout it?
Maybe, but we shore takin' a beatin'.
Forget it, Ma. I got her figgered out. Long as I keep outa trouble, ain't nobody gonna say a thing. All I gotta do is keep my nose clean.
An' that's why you didn't want 'em to look?
She shore don't look prosperous. Want to go somewheres else?
I'm a-tryin', Ma. Honest I am.
Looks like you done it.
That ain't the way they're tellin' it. They're sayin' you done it fust.
Tom! They's a whole lot I don't understan', but goin' away ain't gonna ease us.  They was the time when we was on the lan'. They was a bound'ry to us then. Ol' folks died off, an' little fellas come, an' we was always one thing-- we was the fambly--kinda whole an' clear. But now we ain't clear no more. They ain't nothin' keeps us clear. Al--he's a-hankerin' an' a- jibbitin' to go off on his own. An' Uncle John is just a-draggin' along. Pa's lost his place--he ain't the head no more. We're crackin' up, Tom. They ain't no fambly now. Rosasharn--  --she gonna have her baby, but *it* ain't gonna have no fambly. I been tryin' to keep her goin' but--Winfiel'-- what's he gonna be, this-a-way? Growin' up wild, an' Ruthie, too-- like animals. Got nothin' to trus'. Don't go Tom. Stay an' help. Help me.
I'd like to stay. I'd like to be with ya--  --an' see your face when you an' Pa get settled in a nice little place. I sure wish I could see you then. But--  --I guess I won't never be able to do that. Not now.
No, Ma. Not that. That ain't it. But long as I'm a outlaw, anyways, maybe I can do sump'n. Maybe I can jus' fin' out sump'n. Jus' scrounge aroun' an' try to fin' out what it is that's wrong, an then see if they ain't sump'n could be done about it.  But I ain't thought it out clear, Ma. I can't. I don't know enough.
Me neither.  It's jus' stuff I been thinkin' about. Gimme you han', Ma. Good-by. 
Sure. Good-by.
Yeah?
This ain't a groc'ry store. We got bread to make san'widges with.
You can have this for ten cents.
Tommy?
Ever'body got to get off. Ever'body leavin', goin' to California. My folks, your folks, ever'body's folks.  Ever'body but me. I ain't gettin' off.
Well?
What was the use. He was right. There wasn't a thing in the world I could do about it.
You mean get off my own land?
Who's the Shawnee Land and Cattle Comp'ny?
This here's the desert an' we're right in it!
Come on. Ain't nobody gonna say anything.
Please don't.
What's these?
You people looking for work?
Yes, sir.
You're so funny...
Yeah... Hey, I saw you at your dad's dealership the other day.
Bob...
I'd come to the realization that everything I'd based my life on was false. And that my life had no meaning.
That's a tragedy. Can I finish my story please? I began my search for meaning. I was a Catholic, Jew, Scientologist, Sufi, Buddhist. I went to a Psychologist, psychiatrist, herbalist, nutritionist, a shaman, and a psychic. And they all pretty much say the same stuff.
Basically the same thing. In a very evolved, esoteric way.
So you eat-- read it everyday?
Tell me about yourself.
Ohhh. You're in therapy too, Marty?
Okay. Let's catch up. You go first.
Watched television?
It's a swift spiritual kick to the head that alters your reality forever.
Flowers. That's funny.
Soft. I'll take the junkie otter, clearly! I'd let the little beast scratch and claw all he wants... Okay. Would you rather make love to the candied corpse of Phyllis Diller--
It's just a game...! Alright. Candied Diller, or... wear a hot pork vest across the desert with a fully digested crab apple in your mouth?
How do you know?
How was your day, today, sir?
Well, let's just say that sometimes I'm right. Sometimes you are.
I been looking at you, and I've decided that I want to share something with you.
I am part of a network of minds, a group of five people who are all connected, over hundreds, even thousands of miles, through the mind. We can think with each other, think for each other. I can be driving somewhere, sleeping with a woman-- whatever it is-- and at the same time be thinking a thought in someone else's mind, far away. Running someone else's brain.
It's a free-market evolution. You'll wake up to it... c'mon Kid. We used to run together when you were a rookie. I don't want to run against you. This thing's real. Everybody's in.
Come on, live a little. I'm sorry about the incident yesterday.
I told them to kill you and they didn't.
...How about I sell you two rounds for a hundred grand a piece?
The more things change, the more they Goddamned well stay the same.
You always say that. You always say that. I'm telling you, you never met the man.
I wish he'd do his job already so we could do our job.
So if we do his job, we're the bad guys. If we do our job, we're the good guys.
...Tell them that's not my problem. I was paid for one job-- the cyclist-- not two. See you tomorrow, Marcella.
They were very upset.
Don't forget your identity.
This is not good.
What's it look like?
You haven't looked at the dossier.
You have.
I bought a new rug.
No, I don't have one.
Why don't you return this car and borrow mine? Have Debi follow you to the rent-a-car so you can get a ride back.
Marty! It's me. Paul.
So what happened to you?
God it's great to see you.
I have to get my head back into my work.
When you see Debi, tell her I'm sorry.
So when are you authorized to use deadly force?
How are you? How's business?
I took the other road. I'm more of a self-reflective young lion who does business with lead-pipe cruelty and goes home to drink light beer in milky-eyes isolation. I love sports and sex and have no real relationships with anyone. And you?
Why not?
I'm a professional killer.
I went on the Internet and found this article about you... It says you're a Horse Whisperer, that you... you help people with horse problems. And you have quite a success rate when it comes to traumatized --
It's, uh... beautiful country. I had a little bit of a hard time finding the place. There are no signs.
I uh... ha, ha... I don't think I ever met a lady quite like yourself and I appreciate all the pains you've gone through to --
So how was your first and last day of branding?
It's a man's world, Mr. Booker. Most women have to.
Well... It's beautiful country, I'll give you that. And I could see having some kind of vacation place. Retreat. But I don't know how you do it full time. Don't you miss the rest of the world?
If I can survive rush hour, I figure I can handle grizzlies...
He's beautiful.
Enjoy the day.
Shit.
The answer's no.
How did you meet her?
Why didn't it work out?
Ever think of moving there full time?
This is Mr. Booker, Robert.
Now, listen. I want you to stand on him.
I won't apologize for this. And I won't hide it. Not for anybody.
Oh, God, what are we going to do? I'm supposed to --
Grace, listen to me. Your body is just healing. You have to give the rest of you time as well...
Have you decided about Pilgrim?
Well... how you feel all right about telling Liz to put him down...
IT'S ALMOST LUNCHTIME. ARE YOU HUNGRY!?
Would you like to see that?
This'll be nice. We haven't seen any of the sights yet. It's history. When I was thirteen I used to love seeing things like this.
It's... it's not that simple to explain. I know you think it is, but it's not. The truth is, I don't really know what I want to do. I don't have all the answers.
Did you ask him to come visit?
Mom, they don't mind eating with one fork.
Nothing.
Grace? Is everything all right?  Can we talk?
Well...  So you tried riding again?
STOP IT! Why can't I talk to you!!
Who's ever going to want me? Nobody will.
Why should they?
Smokey told me he left last night to look at some horses in Sheriden. He won't be back for three days. I can't believe he didn't want to say goodbye.
Oh, I miss you. You look beautiful.
Uh, yes... Sure, David.
What about Grace?
I'm sorry.
You've got to stop doing that?
Did you get a hold of that horse guy?
What did he say?
That's the craziest thing I ever heard. Absolutely not.
What... Bo-... What about the magazine?
No. It's, uh... No, I really don't think it's a good idea
What if she doesn't want to go?
Yeah. She seems to be getting more comfortable on the ranch, which is why I said yes to this move. But, whenever it's just the two of us, I don't know... Anyway... what's happening with the Delco lawsuit?
Well then... maybe I will take some time... come visit.
I miss you, Annie.
I thought you guys were going to call me.
I apologize for the surprise, but the days only opened yesterday and I figured...
Are you going to stay in the city or go up to Connecticut?
Yes?
I have so much to tell you.
It's so cruel.
There's coffee inside... I was just bringing this to Tom.
Where does this go, Diane?
But, uh, Egypt is, well, it's like nothing else. It's like going back in time.  I remember as a kid trying to imagine what a kid my age, centuries ago, walking over that same ground, was wondering about or, if they had the same problems as me... and I felt, connected to... to time itself, almost. Ha, I never realized how hard it was to describe.
Must be nice for you to take a few days off from your work, huh?
I think I'm going to have my hands full with the son of mine when you leave. Just might be his first broken heart.
Play that sweet one you know. The one makes my wife here so friendly.
Oh Frank, don't forget the wedding present -- it's behind the door in the laundry room.  I got her a pasta maker from the catalogue... Not that they'll know what to do with it in Branton, Missouri... Probably use it as a planter.
I don't believe they'll expect that.
When you figure on branding?
Now son, you tell 'em when it came from.
You wouldn't want to dance with me, would you?
Yeah?
I can't... not yet...
I thought your mom's coming up?
Long enough.
Does a horse miss a saddle?
Well... Dale... you know, a lot of this stuff... it just... nuts and bolts.
Secret Service!
As you can see, this is just a simple microcassette recorder.   Hook it up to the phone and drop in five bucks in quarters.
Let's keep her.
She's rabid, but cute.
So what do you think, can I crash at your place tonight?
What?
Oh man. That's universally stupid, man!
Yeah but don't forget God. System operators love to use God. It's that whole male ego thing.
Oh wow, we are fried.
Ai! Boom boom aiaiaiaiaee! Alright, that was a little tension breaker, that had to be done, alright?
Due to Mr. Gill's untimely demise and everything, I guess you two will have to improvise the next round.
Can I cut the electricity to his room so he'll sleep normal hours? He's been playing with his computer all night for a solid week.  Well yes, he could be playing with himself. Mmm hmm. Yes I'll ask. Dade, you like girls, don't you?
Aaaah. Did we meet someone special?
I'm fine.  Oh, and Dade, try to stay out of trouble, okay?
The girl. The girl has the disc I need.
Lauren Murphy is now a wanted felon in the state of Washington. Forgery, Embezzlement, two drug convictions, plus she jumped parole. When she's arrested, she will not have a trial, she will not pass go, she will go directly to jail. Then I change this file back to the original, and your mom disappears.
Yes!
That's a nice score for a girl.
He's not in this class.
It's too much machine for you.
You sure this sweet machine's not going to waste?
Yeah.
What?
How?
Oh, wow, she's great.
Security, uh Norm, Norm speaking.
Uhhhmm...
Excuse me.
Yeah, I'm sorry, I was just looking for the principal's office.
Did you find the program for the virus on any of the discs we confiscated?
We have a Zero Bug attacking all the login and overlay files.
What? whatwhatwhat?
I need a handle, man. I don't have an identity until I have a handle.
Anyways, guys, guys, listen, listen to me. I'm in this computer right? So I'm looking around...
You think they're going to bust us?
I don't want to go to jail for this.
But you've created a virus that's going to cause a worldwide ecological disaster, just to arrest some hacker kid?
Murphy kid turn you down?
What is it? What's wrong?
Thank you.
What number please?
Yeah, ha, hell of a night huh?
We need to talk.
Well you found out this morning? Why didn't you tell me before? I mean it's 5 o'clock now Rachel...shit
No, no, we have to get out of here right now.
Brady!
It's hard to tell, there all chewed up.
Mom, please
Oh dear God. Its all right...a bad dream, just a nasty old dream.
Clean one in the laundry room next to your blue slacks.  Hello?
Honey, I don't think their home.
We're not talking about any ordinary prisoner Hoffman! We are talking about evil on two legs.
Four plus Myers.
I do.
Not like 'ol Ben Meeker do something like that.
Kido. It's four in the morning.
Oh, serious questions tonight.  Of course I love you.
Jamie, I'm sorry. I didn't mean it like that. I can go out with Brady tomorrow night. Its no big deal.
The Discount Mart. Can we get Ice Cream after?
Rachel!
We'll hear sirens soon.
You don't believe that do you?
Why don't you go make some coffee.
I didn't know you and Brady had anything okay?
Fact it Rach, you are desperate.  Your just going to go in and buy a costume for Jamie. Perfectly legit.
Call me.
You look sharp. You understand?
You got your riot gun?
Get the outside shutters.
I am. Ben Meeker.
Loomis. Folks around here aren't likely to forget your face. At least not cops. So what brings you back here after 10 years?
Is that him? Is that him?
Oh Christ. They wouldn't have given up without a fight.
It was Michael Myers. He's come home to kill.
How's it powered?
Thank you.
Okay.
Hi, Annie, Laurie...
Someone broke into the hardware store. Probably kids.
Come on, Annie. Bob and I have been planning on it all week.
Saving the treats for Bob?
Look.
Annie, was that you?
Sure, see you later.
Lies.
What's the pumpkin for?
I hate that dog. I'm the only person in the world he doesn't like.
Get him out of here!
You locked yourself in.
Now... First we'll talk a little, then Annie will distract Lindsey and we sneak quietly up the stairs to the first bedroom on the left. Got it?
You idiot!
That's great. Now you'll be too drunk to...
Is that all you say?
Go get me a beer.
Sheriff? I'm Doctor Sam Loomis.
I'd like to talk to you, if I could.
Ten minutes.
Jesus!
Sure...
TOTALLY!
Hey, Laurie...
Are you coming over tonight?
Will you read to me? Can we make popcorn?
I gotta go. I'll see you tonight.
Not any more.
Laurie...
I saw the bogyman. I saw him outside.
There WAS.
Right.
Tommy, stop it! You're scaring Lindsey.
Now I want you to change your clothes, Tommy. We're going to take a walk outside.
Yes, she is.
I don't think this is any time to be funny...
...because there are no interesting single men at this party!
Hi.
What are your favorite buildings, David?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Uh-- APRIL  I-i-it has an o-organic quality, you know.
That's disgusting!
Well, I live downtown.
Yeah, we have Mr. Morris Levine's eightieth birthday party on Riverside Drive...or Riverside Memorial Chapel, depending on his health.
You're joking.
You're Holly.
Now I'm going to tell you the truth. I really came in here because I was bored stiff by the party.
I always, I-I always imagine that I have things.
What I'd like to do, is to make an appointment for you at the hospital. I'd like to have them run some tests.
Now, don't get alarmed.  These are just more sophisticated audiometry tests than I can run here.  I mean, it's, it's nothing.
What a weirdo that guy is!  Paranoid.  What's the matter with you?
It's not that big a deal.  We just didn't hit it off.
Yeah.  Some of them...yeah, some of them are very big.
Child molestation is a touchy subject...
Oh, my goodness!
Hi.
Where are you headed?
Isn't this great?  They have everything here.
Yes, I'd...I-I-I'd love, I'd love to get you this.
I have to get my teeth cleaned this week.
Yes.  This kid, he's earned a trillion dollars.
Oh, and Holly met a wonderful man who loves opera.  An architect.
They have a very large gay clientele, you know, where I get my teeth cleaned, and...all the hygienists now wear gloves because they're afraid of AIDS.
Wh--, it-it-it-it, it's so sad. She's crazy about me, but somewhere on the, along the line, I've fallen out of love with her.
Tch, no!  We were, we were both going in different directions.
But-but, but how about you?  Do you, do you share any of my feelings? Or is this just an unpleasant embarrassment to you?
W-well, please be candid.  I, I-I don't want you to feel bad.
Lee... uh...
You've been very cold to me tonight.
Is something wrong?
It's over, Elliot.  I don't know how to make it any clearer.  It's over.  I can't see you anymore.
Yeah, but we-we made so many plans.
They're fantastic.
Your sister is an unbelievable cook.
Why do you say that?  Is there something wrong?
Well, tell me.  Should I be worried?
Yeah, but I...uh--I thought you needed that.  When-when-when we met, you said your life was chaos.
No!
Well, what?  What, wh-what are you not telling me?
You matter to me.  Completely.
...this is a toast!  This is a toast.
I don't know about that.  Oh, no, I just, see, I-I've been very, very lucky.  W-when I had the kids, I decided to stop working and just, you know, devote myself to having the family, and I've been very, very happy  but...I've always secretly hoped that maybe some little gem would come along and tempt me back on the stage...
Don't make it worse, Dad.
Of what?  I'll be unconscious.
Are you sure?
Well, there was a time  when you were very happy to be only with me.  You wanted to learn everything about poetry, about music.
Me?
Elliot lusts after you.
Big.  Frederick, show him the oils.
You know, you've been very nervous lately.
Why?
Tch, oh.  I always told you you would leave me.  But...does it have to be now?
Oh, couldn't you say something? You have to slither around behind my back!
Oh, God, that's too much responsibility for me.  It's not fair!  I want a less complicated life, Frederick.  I want a husband, maybe even a child before it's too late.
But there's nothing wrong with you.
Well, he has to rule out certain things. 
It was on your shirt!
Yeah.  What?
Maybe you need a few weeks in Bermuda, or something.  Or go to a whorehouse!  No?
Oh, I don-- Ask Elliot for that. Uh, he's got them somewhere.
Oh, yeah?
Oh, he's fine.  He's-he's, I guess he's fine.  I don't know.  He's been kinda moody lately, the last few months.
Yeah, aren't you like, you know...
Oh!
I like him.  I think he's a sweet guy.
What are you talking about?
Um, I-I didn't really want to, you know, go to a sperm bank or something, have some anonymous donor.  I-I just, you know, I-I-I wouldn't want that.
Hey!
Okay, stop being so dramatic.
What?  You're kidding!
Holly, please.  Don't insult me.
Well, in order to get started, there's just a few things I have to buy...  and some old debts I have outstanding.
He's such a loser!
Ouch!
You found all this, all this out on one date?
I know, no--  I know.
Boy, you really know how to cut me down.
You're too demanding.
What's the matter with you, Lee? Why are you so sensitive all of a sudden?
Well--
Oh, why are you making those faces?
I love songs about extraterrestrial life, don't you?
Can I take you someplace to hear something nice?
Oh, look, I'm sorry it didn't work out.
You know, it's probably my fault. I've been a little depressed lately.
God!
Mmm, I don't know if you remember me, but we had the worst night of my life together.
I'd never do that.
Oh, well, that was a long time ago.
People change...you know.
Yeah, I hope you have, too. MICKEY  I hope so for your sake, because, uh, your personality left something to be desired...
Yeah?  Is that an embarrassing question?  Should I have not asked it?
I haven't.  No, the reason why I ask is I think it might make a great, uh, television script, and, you know, you're so active in television, so--
Well, what about me?
Oh!
Oh, God!
Gosh, you really went through a crisis, you know that?  H-how did you get over it?  I mean, when I ran into you, you seemed, you seemed just perfectly fine.  Well, you seem fine now.
Um...look, there's something I've, uh, that's been bothering me for a long time, and I just thought I'd just tell you what it was and just sort of clear the deck here, and  that's this.
When'd you get here?
Yeah.
Oh, please!  We all came to have lunch, didn't we?
Why are you so upset?
Yeah, well, what's your religion?
You're afraid of dying? MICKEY  Well...yeah, naturally.  Aren't you? I-- L-let me ask you, reincarnation, does that mean my soul would pass to another human being, or would I come back as a moose or an aardvark or something?
A reward...
You know why that is?  Because there are so few things I need to forget. Would you agree, for the record, that I have not been read my rights?
What have they got you doing?
You lasted eight years, as Orderly, in Dr. Lechter's prison ward.
...why?
You said "here's what <u>they</u> want you to do..."  Why?
No, you're wrong about Verger.
C'mon, pal.
Then you tell me, then.
I feel...  I feel they're Out to <u>Get</u> Me...
How you doin?
Who, can you think, who would want to harm Dr. Fanelli, did he have any <u>enemies</u>, that...
..who would benefit from his disappearance?  <u>No</u> one.  No one has but lost by it...
Somewhere where his family are offering a thirty grand reward for Information, so on.
...are they hard to get?
Can we identify it as Dr. Lechter?
HE TURNED BACK INTO THE ROOM.  Where have we Seen it Before.
...sir...?
If you would see him monument, look around you.
...thank you...  And how are you this evening, Doctor? No, we know that you're awake...
What would <u>that</u> be?
And how would you know that?
...here's to child abuse!
Why would you say that?  Because he sent me in there to be killed...?  What <u>is</u> this...?
Look at this:
A fellow with five fingers.
I know you did what you could.
She threw a punch at a man on the team.
Waited too long, hon...?  
Sadly, no.  And I find that birth is one of the few things in life which study and a pleasant attitude can not amend. What do you think?
How wonderful of you, to hold that information in your <u>busy</u> mind...
I never met him.  I knew him only from his writings.
And you have a new wedding ring on yours? <u>La Vita Nuova</u>?-- 
My scar is a war-wound.
Yes.  How did you know?
Darling...
Do you like it at your home, Franklin?
Yes.  Franklin, you can't live there anymore.  With Mama and Shirly and Kittykat.  You have to go away.
I came to pay my...
You look lovely.
I hope you'll <u>find</u> it so.  Yes.  It's <u>good</u> to see you regaining your strength...
He saw the truth, and <u>spoke</u> it...
Thank you, Cordell.
...which of us is free...?
No.
Trouble is, they all seem to <u>die</u>.
Don't shoot yourself.
...why are we here in the <u>first</u> place...?
The Case that I am <u>working</u> on...
Ask me when we get home.
I know something no one knows.  He has had his finger removed.  On his left hand.  It left a scar. 
But perhaps, there is some, some less radical solution.
His feelings do him honor.  And I have come, simply, to pay my <u>respects</u> to the great Clarice Starling... 
<u>Do</u> you.  What does that mean?
I din't solve it, I didn't '<u>solve it</u>'.  I just sat a <u>dance</u> out with him.  Facts, facts, facts.  <u>Facts</u>, close the case, cavalier.
Thirty thousand dollars reward.  In the whereabouts of Il Dottore Fanelli, or the apprehension of his...
Then, that being so, why is today special?  Why have you come back to see me?  Is it that new file they gave you?
Yes.  I think I <u>do</u>.  I think it is a phrase you used with that woman.  You told her you were an <u>orphan</u>.  You <u>used</u>, to your mind, your most private fears.
Your father.  It is not <u>they</u>, who...
If <u>he</u> could overcome... his need for... for self-<u>ratification</u>...
Yes.
And all he <u>left</u> us:  the Country brought back his <u>hat</u>, and his <u>badge</u>... both with a bullethole in them.  An' that's what he left us.  That's what I said.
And.  I always said, he was a <u>P'lice</u> officer.
But.  He was a night <u>watchman</u>.  That's what he was.  N'They brought back, his hat, his <u>badge</u>, an his <u>timeclock</u>.  N'then they took me off.  I <u>saw</u>... I saw.  Clear as day, do you, do they call it a <u>delusion</u>?  His hat an his badge.  Clear as day, bulletholes and all.
...sir...?
Believe me, I wish I knew less.  Oh, if you weren't such a pig...
No really, keep talking, I ree-ally want to hear what you have to say, you're just so eloquent...
It's funny, when I first met you I thought you were such a weirdo...I still think you're a nut, but you're my nut.
That doesn't make me feel better! Why are you being like this?
I'll bet you're glad I waited until the last day to have this conversation.
Pamela Anderson, Kate Moss, Halle Berry, and Fiona Apple, all naked in one room. You can do anything you want to them, except one of them has full-blown Aids, and you don't know who. And you're not allowed to use a condom.
Howdy Pouty.
I'm in the picture on Wendy's wall. Niagara Falls. Family trip. Little Wendy foreground. Me background. What are the odds on that one?
Talia, don't go!
Freeze!  You're busted!
Thanks, Talia...Why are you so nice to me?
Go stand by the flagpole.
I guess it was too much to ask that it would somebody older...and maler. Like you.
Hello?!  What's in it for me?
Geez, what time is it?  I have to go feed Big Chief Oberon...You're right, I miss him. Wichita, that is.  I really want to be with him, but I can't bring myself to--Are you a lesbian or are you...
You'll be hiding behind a tree.
One day they'll find a cure for AIDS. They'll never find one for sex. It's kind of funny, most movies and stories with a bunch of camp counselors has some serial psycho in the woods with a chainsaw who systematically butchers everybody one by one.
College was entertaining, Wichita, but after 40 days and 40 nights of this, I really think we're going to get to know each...
Stop, stop, what was I thinking...out in the wilderness.  Under the stars. I've ruined every--
Isn't this the time where one of us says something deeply offensive to the other one...We're just so different.
We had fun. I even got along with Talia-- for about three minutes. I don't know why she hates me so much...
I know what you mean. But it doesn't put me in too great a position...
Fuck off.
She got a little poison oak and started screaming for assisted suicide.
Ah, our last night at camp...I always knew it would be something special.
Iunno.  Of course I believe you. It's so you...I didn't think it was possible                        ] for you to make me feel worse,                              ] but...you're saying you <u>deliberately</u>                        ] destroyed us!

God, you're beautiful.
I don't believe it. I'm winning.
I missed you. I know I'm not as, as exciting as your other friends.
Hey, you're not settling for the two shots are you? Knock me out girl. It's the only way.
If I got that money, I'd give it all to the poor. Every cent.
I don't know. This thing leaves a bad taste in my mouth.
I'm sorry? I don't get it.
Goddamn. Will somebody please tell me why I read this spy crap.
I was talking with someone!
Doesn't it bother you that everyone in the school thinks you're a pirahna?
Crap. So who's this Brad guy I've been set up with? Witty and urbane pre-lawyer or albino accountant?
Grow up, Heather. Bulimia's so '86.
Don't worry. We'll work something out.
Guess who?
Watch it, Heather. You could actually be digesting food.
That was seriously warped, Veronica.
What were <u>you</u> trying to do? Sleep?
I've been moved around all my life; Dallas, Baton Rouge, Vegas, Sherwood Ohio, there's always a 7-11. Any town, any time, I can pop a Ham and Cheese in the microwave and feast on a Big Wheel. Keeps me sane.
My father seems to enjoy tearing things down more than putting things up. Seen the commerical? "Bringing every State to a Higher State."
Dreadful etiquette. I apologize.
Well then, I'll pray for rain.
She missed "myriad" on a vocab test two weeks ago, all right?
We don't want to make them out to be too secretly eloquent. Why would the Germans invent a bullet that doesn't kill people? I mean it <u>was</u> World War Two, not a school play.
It doesn't work on small animals!
Did to.
Get off my bed, you sick psycho! You think you're a rebel! You're not a rebel! You're a sick psycho! Do you think you're a rebel? Do you think you're a rebel? I wanna know!
It's all over, J.D. Help me to stop it.
Cool off, we're seniors.
You two....
How was the funeral?
Dear Veronica, Heather was your soulmate.....Share.
I'm so sorry. I was led to believe there were going to be different kinds of social and psychological types at this gathering.
I adore anything to do with the arts.
This story of yours-maybe the school newspaper will print it when it's finished.
and Pauline hurriedly work together, setting out plates and cutlery.
accompanies Hilda into the hallway.
Bye.
I spent a wretched night. It would be wonderful if I could get tuberculosis, too.
My God, what a disgrace you are! You shame me, you shame the family. You're nothing but a cheap little tart!
whirls around and slaps Pauline on the cheek.
My name is Gina!
You're rude . . . rude and insolent! I don't see why I should keep a horrid child like you at school a minute longer.
I belong with Deborah! We're going to South Africa!
You have it.
Look, Mother!
I wouldn't want my private business being discussed with a complete stranger!
Hello!
Oh-what a nice outfit!
Fruit.
0h, God . . . I'm so sorry!
This.
That.
He flings open the door and launches himself at the bed, ravishing her!
How do you know? Did he tell you?
Just a couple more . . .
Poor Mother was completely taken in.
Poor Father . . .
Isn't it beautiful!
Where's Kirsty? Where's my wife?
Well? What do you say Trevor? Que pasa?
Allison? Why can't remember what happened to my wife? Is it something I'm on that's... that's making me forget?
No I need to remember. Look whatever it is take me off it. I can handle pain. I can't handle not knowing...
These hallucinations I'm having. I think they're more like memories coming back to me in a strange way.
Well Trevor? What have you got to say for yourself? Que pasa?
It's inside a moving car.
Yeah. It's like I was a different guy then I am today. I can't remember that guy. I see these women, they think I'm someone else, and I'm not that guy anymore. I'm not sure who Kristy knew.
I understand... I won't-
I have my connections
Bret you are making no sense whatsoever.
Why don't you relax for the next couple of hours? Barring any relapses you should be able to go home after that.
No. No you said HER BODY's been missing.
You could say that.
Come on speak up, Gooding, I'm trying to run a business here. I can't have people flipping out in the break room when they should be slaving away at their desks.
What isn't wrong? Why are you doing this anyway?
Just concentrate on the task at hand please. Listen to me. You should be giving ME this lecture.
Yes I had a quickie with the neighbor during your last contraction.
Kirsty... Kirsty?
You're alive...
Trevor I've decided we have got to agree on a name before we reach my mother's. This poor kid's going to be starting preschool as student x if we don't make up our minds. So, I've been thinking, what about Daisy?
Thanks for coming down Mr. Gooding. Has your head healed okay by now?
What happens if I'm convicted of Kirsty's murder?
Please Larry. Pretend you like me and humor me.
Dreams?
My teacher told me once there's a puncture point on your body that can lock your soul within it, even after you're dead. So that when you die you're trapped inside your body, watching it corrode for all eternity.
It was an analogy. Your soul is locked up inside you. You need to free it Trevor. You've blocked it from the healing process. That's what we need to do now. Heal your soul. And to do that I you have to give in utterly and without any hesitation or doubt. Do you know what I mean by giving in? It's about trust. Do you trust me implicitly?
I'm kinda feeling nuts myself!
If you ever smelled this coming from our dorm room, you knew one of us was in there getting laid.
Tawny I think I'm going to be sick.
Whoa, I have serious space issues, dude. What do you want?
And you pulled people out? You're...  a hero.
Looks like you live in here, for Chrissake!
Hey, Bubber, c'mere!  I gotta talk to you, buddy.
The bathroom!  For two days?
And she thinks you're blackmailing me?
Which don't sound like such a bad goddamn idea, John.
You got those people out of the plane, LaPlante, not me.
I know what he means.  I'm not a prison kinda guy, Miss O'Day.  I'm a goddamn working man for Chrissake!  Maybe I "augment" my income a little with some "business deals," maybe summa the guys I sell to are crooks, how would I know, I'm not an investigator.  You can't make it on a wage no more, not in this country.
Yeah, I been calling in sick.  They think I got the flu.
Uh, his birthday, uh, May.  I think.
Uh, I know you're having financial difficulties, Mister LaPlante, but I wonder if... I mean, the money I loaned you...
Listen, now that I owe you twenty-five hundred bucks plus, how about loaning me twenty for cab fare?
I seen on the TV where that do-gooder asshole's gonna go visit sick kids at three-thirty.  Children's Hospital, on the double.
Take a look at my employment record, you got my employment record there, right?  You see any unemployment there, any welfare? I'm a taxpayer.  They eat me alive, the tax people, they got taxes on everything, taxes, taxes, taxes, and forms!  Taxes and forms so I can pay your goddamn salary, so you can sit there and write stuff, guys like me pay your wages...
Do I hit anybody?  You see me shoot anybody?  Hey, drugs!  Do I sell drugs?  Jesus, I don't belong in prison.  I'm a family man.
You gotta kid?  How old's your kid?
You got a ten year old attorney, Bernie?
Bernie, how'sa kid?
Willya lemme talk for Chrissake? I'm trying to tell you what happened.  What happened is...
That's what I'm trying to... to... okay, nevermind.  Just lemme talk to Joey to... to apologize.
"Elliot"?  The heroic goddamn fireman?
"Harassed."  Cause I yelled at him when he's riding in his limo?  The guy's a thief, he took my...
I could deny I had those credit cards on the plane with me, LaPlante...
I snuck in.
Is she... serious?  A half a million dollars?  In my behalf?
Years?  There are going to be lots of... opportunities.
I know the truth, John.  I'm flying in some guys from your unit in Vietnam tomorrow.  Interviewing them live on network hookup!
Gale!  This is for you.  I want you to know I never meant to hurt you. This will explain everything.
What're we talking about?  Reach out for what?
This guy LaPlante won an award?
We're piecing together different accounts and...
How'd it go?
Ticket!  What's going on?
I thought they'd all go "It's him! It's him!" and hug the guy or something.
Does this mean I can stop worrying? Where'd we put him?
Whaddaya mean what do I wanna know? I wanna know everything.  Who's this screwball LaPlante for Pete's sake, what the hell's he doing out there, auditioning for the priesthood? You're supposed to be on top of this, Gale, don't...  "Quit!"  You can't quit!  It's unprofessional!
The Presidency.  The public loves him.
He lost a shoe!
Hi, Chief.  You like the suicide?
LaPlante!  That asshole!  I don't... Hey, is that you, from the tee vee? In person?
"This is Gale Gayley for Channel Four News!"  Incredible. Unbelievable!  For Bernie LaPlante! He's a celebrity now?  'Cause he stole <u>paint</u>?
You didn't... get it on with him?
Give it here, Bernard.
So where are all your toys?
Any particular brand?
Wife, girlfriend or mother?
How's the new place?
Yeah, things are moving along, but she's still involved with this other guy and it's a little tricky.
And how are things with your lady friend, if I may call her that?
The whole disapproval thing.  If you allow yourself to get into a situation where someone else's potential disapproval becomes the focal point of your life -- then you're back to a life of fear, aren't you?  -- You're a prisoner to that again, and that isn't much of a life.
I've cultivated her interests so that now we have even more in common than ever.
Oh no -- I mean, she's genuinely made me more fulfilled in many ways -- and I hope eventually to be able to teach her a few things, too.  What I mean is, I guess I'm still waiting for just that right -- synthesis between us -- where everything will be understood between us without even the need for words.
So, you're just kind of a roving --
It's nice that you can make that choice.
Not me, I fell for it right down the line.  Be a good girl and believe all the fairy tales.  He married me because I was pretty.
I was driving by -- I saw all the cars.  Are you all right?
'"... or I'll huff and I'll puff and I'll blow your house down!" And inside their new house, the three little pigs just laughed -- '
A man?  Was it a dream?
So you don't have anything concrete?
I'm sure that's all it is, honey. Maybe you both just need a vacation.
I could take a cab on the way home.
Thank God.
How long does it have to be a new house?
I mean, he's a smart kid, he'll get by -- he takes after me. You're too sensitive.
I <u>remember</u> what day you wore that jacket.  It was <u>Monday</u>.  The day you were all day in <u>meetings</u> again?  And had to send out for <u>sandwiches</u>?
The floor has a nice shine to it.  Oh God -- we have twenty-two messages on the machine.
Honey -- I can't find those large- size Hefty trash bags!
Boy, you really buckle under a little pressure, don't you?
You're even sadder and more burnt- out than I thought.
What?
Should I come home when I'm finished there?
It's been on the market a while, hasn't it?
This is a terrific entrance hall, What a welcoming feeling.
You knew a second ago.  <u>Who</u> started it?
Do you see a man?
And this -- is the master bedroom.
Is it a king or a queen?
Really?
What the hell.  What is this?  A joke?
Where's the guy we saw in the beginning -- what's his name...?
Did you find a sword?  An old sword?
He had to come from somewhere.
I asked the State Department to check with our Embassies and Interpol to see if there were any similar occurrences like the bank.  Two weeks ago in London Charles Redder from the Bronx was mugged in Hyde Park.
What?
For Chrissake!  Gimme a break.  The guy disappears for seven years and as soon as he comes back it starts again.
I brought you here to talk about him. Do you know him?
Seven years ago I interviewed a guy. He said he saw two men fighting in an alley with swords.  One cut off the others head.  He shot the surviving guy twenty times and he got right back up and stabbed him.
Life.  You've stopped living it.  You look, but you do not see.  You listen but, you do not hear.
The river.
Maybe myself.
Thank you, Thomas.
For being a friend when I needed one. I hope our paths cross again.
To ask her to dance.
Yes.
I'll go first.
I stood up first.
What do you think?
Your words are kind and they flatter me -- but I think of her as a sister. Besides, you hardly know me.
How comes it your are not afraid?
We had a bargain.  You promised.
Aye?
Leaving?  For how long?
Do you love me, Conner?
No.  I'm an archaeologist.
Why do you stare at me like that?
Do you always walk around with a sword?
Good evening.
You have an interesting accent. Where are you from?
That makes you uncomfortable?
Why not?
Let me ask you something else.  At the excavation site in Scotland, the tunnel leading into the cavern had collapsed.  The day we found the body someone had moved the rocks, making a hole in the collapsed section.  What bothers me is that we found the rocks from the hole on our side of the tunnel wall.
On the back it has--
You wanted the truth -- now you have it.
He's fine.  He swears he never left his post for a moment.  He heard a noise and when he went back to look they were already inside.
Do you?  Then why don't you go out? Meet someone.  Make a life for yourself instead of hiding away in the past?
Impressive -- is it not?  The problem is I can only keep the illusion for a few minutes.  I need more power to hold the form longer.  I need the Highlander.  Where is he?
It isn't over, is it, Conner?
What are you doing?
I could have ended it tonight, but I didn't.
Do not underestimate the power of your heart.  Your dreams live there.
Did they?  You are only a man, different than most -- but still a man.  You feel the same -- want the same.  You want to live.
Would you like to deposit this in your account?
Call the Palmdale City Attorney for a telephonic search warrant.  When you get the warrant, have Mikkelson and Dreyer search his house.
Sonny's a fuckup.  If he pulls this off, fine--life goes on.  But if the cops end up with those disks, we cut our losses.
Worst case, it's a bloodbath.  The detectives come out with Smith's computer, and we go directly to jail, do not pass Go.
Jen?  Are you all right?
Stay down!  Stay <u>down</u>, goddamnit!
There's fuckin' blood all over you!
That's why we gotta keep going.  I'm not gonna go in for murder.
That cop didn't pull his gun.  Mars lied. He just started shooting!
I was <u>there</u>, Dennis!  I <u>saw</u>!  It's like he <u>wanted</u> to shoot that cop.
Jesus.  What is this?
We're cool.
Fuck you.  I'm running this shit.  You talk to me.
Mr. Kim didn't make it, Dennis.  He died.
I want a helicopter to take us to Mexico.
You're a funny guy, Talley.
We can take it with us.
Cops want to be rich like everyone else. All we have to do is share.  And if he wants someone to swing for the Chinaman, we'll give'm Mars.
<u>Shit</u>!  That <u>fuck</u>!  Even when I want to turn myself in he screws it up!  Did he take the kids with him?
What if it goes south?
I heard he's fucked up.  They're taking him to the hospital.
<u>I don't know</u>.  Talley talked those punks into letting Smith out.  He's fucking us over, Glen.  That guy is fucking us over.
I have your fucking family.  Don't forget that.
What do you want?
Fuck that!  You think I'm crazy?!
Fuck the mall.  You know that motel on the road west of town?
Take it easy.  Just take it easy.  We're here to do business.
They're close.  Let me make a call.  You can see they're okay.
All right.  Now the second one.
I need to work out some stuff.
Ow!  Shit!
You gotta pee?
I can't go without Thomas.
How can we get out?
I'm the chief of police here.  I have to talk to him.
What are you talking about, shot?  What happened?
Is something wrong with Jane?
He didn't say.
Louise?
Call Jane for me.  She's at the little Thai place.
Did you find Jane and Mandy?
Do it.
Then get your men off the wall!  You breach that house, we're gonna have a bloodbath!  I <u>know</u> this guy, Captain -- I can talk to him.
I'm not stupid!  You can't get out of here fast enough, then you take back command; you agree to wait on Smith, then you risk everything in a stupid stunt to get him out --
Let it go, Captain.
The truck is registered to Dennis James Rooney, white male, twenty-two.  He has an Agua Dulce address.
It's mine.  Talley.
Mickey?  Call the state Homicide Bureau. Don't touch anything, just sit back and wait.
In a few minutes the white phone is going to ring.  So let's get our shit straight before that happens.
What are you people going to do?
This is Chief Talley.  Tell me your name, son.
How about you and your sister?
I can get into the crawlspace from my closet and climb all over the house.
Don't just fuckin' sit there, dumbass. Do you understand?
Marlon and Al....
You dumb fuckwad cop, you fucked up <u>bad</u>!
I guess we each have something the other wants.
Excuse me?
You want to pay me?
Paul, you know who this is?
Congratulations, Colonel. You have saved us all.
I am worried about thieves and criminals coming into the hotel. Perhaps you could arrange for some police to guard us.
He did.
I will see what I can do.
I am strong, Paul, like a lion.
You have cockroaches dancing on tables and you tell me the cellar is empty? Did they drink my whiskey?
Your police are at the gate?
Where are they going?
Ishca Baha - the water of life. I went on a tour once of the finest single malt distillery in the world. Have you ever been to Scotland?
I am going to do you a great favor.  I am going to take you with us to Gitarama.
You are a marked man.
Everything is double the price now, you do understand that?
Beer yes, but no whiskey.
Mr. Manager.
Paul, how the hell are ya'?
Can we phone them in, Paul?
Who did you call?
Don't lie to me. What's your name?
What do you want?
It is dangerous to be here. The radio says this is a nest of cockroaches.
I'm afraid you will have to move room.
I'm going to put you on the third floor.
This time the Militia will kill us.
Call your friends in the army. Call someone. Victor is harmless. This is a mistake.
The president has been murdered.
Is every Tutsi in the neighborhood here?
Send them home. We are not the police. What do we have to protect them?
Any luck?
This is not bad news, Tatsi. Perhaps they fled or could not make it home. There is hope.
Your card says Hutu. Take our children, go and get the twins, pay money at the roadblocks. Get them out. Please.
Go to the roof now.
Lynch Bages, 84. Perfect with lamb, or fine rare beef.
I have to go out to get food.
To Rutagunda's place. It is close by.
I have to, Tatiana, we are only as valuable as the service we provide.
I have a confession. When we met...
I had you transferred to Kigali.
To be closer. So that I could marry you.
I have to stay.
The Diplomat! Tatiana wakens, startled.
That is why they call it coach?
Where has all our beer gone?
I saw Gregoire make a call, sir?
We'd've been splitsville years ago, with me the richest single woman in recorded history -- but Steven doesn't "believe" in divorce.
Easy. You've got to keep still for a bit, the last thing we need is a coronary.
Still alive, but it's just a matter of time. And then will come your miraculous resurrection --
"But you didn't, Ma'am. We have all these witnesses that saw..." well, whoever it ends up being that finally shoots him --
-- Price killed her, there's no other explanation --
It's not, baby. Just a matter of minutes now, before somebody pulls the trigger --
If you don't mind me asking... Who are you?
Jesus H. Christ!
Looks like we're it.
Oh, for chrissake --
Now what do we do? We've got to hold him somewhere 'til the police --
If there really is someone else in this house, I think the four of us can handle the situation.
Put it this way: if it's your face on that tape, Mr. Moses, we're one gunshot away from solving all our problems --
I wanna know first: to what do I owe this honor? I mean, I never even heard of this guy.
So, what? You're saying we're stuck here the rest of our lives?
What is it? What's in there?
How's a goddamn building gonna send out invitations?
Oh. Jesus.
If you know where it is, get there!
Right here, Mr. Pritchett. As well as five other bona fide, bank drafts for one million dollars each. Made out to cash.
I'll meet you down there.
Evelyn, could you just zip it for a moment? It looks like we're stuck here 'til morning -- let's make the best of it.
-- the stained glass --
Why not?
What the hell good is fixing that gonna get us?
We can do it...
I was upstairs with Eddie --
I think we should have taken a right back there.
Good point.
Don't think it's even an issue.
Then what the hell are we doing here?
I guess it was stupid of me not to expect something this twisted from you. Well, congratu-fucking-lations, Steven: Round One, you win.
You know how happy I'd be if that was really true, Evelyn? And how positively goddamn delirious if you weren't fucking every living thing in our area code at the same goddamn time!
Game, set and match, Steven. You've outdone yourself. And I know it's not good manners to ask the magician how he did it, but inquiring minds are desperate to know: just what did really happen to Ms. Marr?
I mean, did she stage it all for you and then go hide -- or did you just flat out kill the little bitch --
Messenger just dropped it off. No return address.
-- well, here's a better one: you're fired.
...wow....WOW! Hey, Ms. Jenzen -- ?
Ever seen one that starts at the top? 20 stories worth of top?
Do something!
House 2, Guests 0.
What is it??
Fascinated.
Well, I don't.
Don't test me, I'm real prepared to use this to stay alive --
-- hey! Next time give me a couple seconds notice before you wing a gag like that!
But the million bucks each, that's for real?
Won't do any good.
Uh, excuse me? Don't think I'm not having the time of my life watching this train wreck that's your marriage -- but this isn't what I had in mind... I want to know that we can get out of here if we need to.
No, you don't want to go down there. I am going down there. And I'm going to find <u><b>reverse</b></u> on this thing and floor it.
Ghosts killed your father?
Excuse me?
Something....happened --
Damn it.
It doesn't say.  But that's not what interests me.  There's no death certificate for the daughter.  Anywhere.
I have to admit you really have a beautiful home.
How did you meet Dr. Shea?
I have to admit I was skeptical.  Until now.
It will heal.
Where does this amulet come from?
The dagger is used to free those possessed if stabbed directly into the heart, according to ancient beliefs -
What do these ingredients mean?
Can we leave out a bowl of milk, mommy?
Can I do it again tonight?
Don't play games with me, little girl.
It's going to hurt us!
She's down...
Aubrey, come on down and have some dinner!
Where are we going to go, mommy?
What about all my other stuff?
H-how long will it take?
Your father doesn't love us anymore!
She's down.  Help her...
What's he doing daddy?
Look daddy!  It's empty!
Good night Angel...
I hope we have more success than we did with the cleaning service.
What's the matter?
It's just going to take a while.
God rest her soul.
No.  Maybe it was Aubrey.
No.
But do you agree with me?
A friend?
It doesn't matter to me.  What do you mean by that?
You know, I was thinking... All that stuff father Seamus said...about discord, distrust... we're doing all right, aren't we?  You don't have any doubts about me, do you?
Maura, what is this!
Are you all right?
What do you mean, unfortunately?
Is white meat all right for you, Mr. Shea?
Concentrate!  She can hear you!
My name is Father Seamus.  I'm from Holy Rood church.
I hope everything works out for you, and you find happiness in your new home.
Keep talking!
What's going to happen?
Take care of the girl.  Take care of your family.  They are important.
Well, you know where to reach me. The church is a stone's throw away if you want to come to mass.
No.  But I'm a clairvoyant.  I can sometimes talk to unhappy spirits inhabiting a certain place.
Do you have any other physical evidence, that we can look at?
There's something in there.
C'mon, Joey.  I'm just trying to help you hit a home run here.
Better hurry, Doc.  A real story.  With a real reporter.
It's ... I don't know.  First World War, right?
The cusp of my life.  What I was, what I am, what I will be ... past, present, future, all bound here at this timeless moment of decision.  I was an explorer of forbidden vices and pleasures. Opening the Box was my final act of exploration, of discovery.
Kirsty Cotton.  Yes.  But ... if your soul was freed, why are you back?
What will he do?  What does he want?
This is his first night on Earth.  He wants to close the door behind him. Like all Lieutenants, he covets command. There's a gateway to Hell through which he can be taken back.  He has to destroy it.
Right ... So ... Well, what do you want?
Yeah.  Sure.  You mean ... tonight?
Why are you so interested?
What?
Great.  Thanks.  You gonna have one?
But I don't know anything!  Really.  I just came out of the club and the kid was already in the street.  He ...
The thing!  He was lying there in the street, moaning.  But he pointed at it ... 22
Yeah!  That's what I'm saying!  And it was lying next to him.  And he pointed at it before he passed out and ...
This is great.  And it's yours?  You like own it?
Wow.  Lotta books.  You read all these?
Cool.  I read a book once.  It was like all these people discovering who they used to be.  You know, like reincarnation?  It was really good.  You ever read that?
I was downtown looking for a ... a friend.  A guy I know.  Anyway, there was this store.  Like real old?  Lotsa weird shit in there.  I saw this statue. Pillar.  Thing.  I knew he'd love it. You've seen the club.
Joey ... ?
Thank you.
It's yours.  You won it.  It's a prize.
He's a barman.  Whatever.  Do you mind if I continue?
Yes really.
Don't flee from yourself.  If you have a quality, let it define you.  Cultivate it.  It is you.  By helping me, you will help yourse...
A dark star rising.  I was bound to another's system by a soul I once possessed.  A friend relieved me of that inconvenience.  Now I'm free.  Born again of Blood and Desire.
You see, we're not so dissimilar.
Yeah right.  How'd you get this number?
Yeah really.  I'm ...
You're apologizing?
I miss you too.
Yeah right.  Look ...
I don't think so.  Not yet.  I'm not ready yet.
That's terrible.  What a bitch.  She was obviously just using you, Terri.  Ready to dump you the second she had what she needed, interfering little whore.
Not anymore.  Now I'm the laziest damn cat burg--I'm going to take it so straight that I won't tape a Mets game without the expressed written consent of the National Baseball League.
I didn't know how to tell you.  A couple brokers stopped in for Stoley Spritzers one night.  Next thing I know Fast Track Digest votes us "Watering Hole of the Month."  Now, I'm shopping for Aqua Salmon wallpaper.
I'm sorr--Goddamn Mario Brothers. Goddamn Gates.  Goddamn Rutherford Auction House.  By the way, how many seconds?
"A mule is an animal with long funny ears."
"He can't write his name or read a book.  To fool people is his only thought."
Did I miss anything?
The Butler did it.  Guy was a cross between Alistair Cook and a Cuisinart. Dude took Mr. Ed and humptied dumptied it over Gates's head.  He said it was made by, get this, Leonardo..
We're going in from the ground floor.
Count of three?
That was close....
Ta ta, Hudson Hawk.
Welcome to Rome, sir.
Don't you just hate kids...
With all due respect to that great blouse, why didn't I cut out her heart?
This is the room above the Art Treasures room.  The lock is a Natalya Z-Z, first created...
"Messed around" messed around?  I know-- I don't want to know.  First base?  Second Base?  Stop me when I'm getting warm...
My God, that was bold of you, you didn't have to do that...
No, I meant you didn't have to tackle me and rip my dress.  A polite push, perhaps?  A clear shout of "watch out, Anna" would have done nicely...
Tough guy.  What are you--How's your head.
God, I wish I could say the same thing.  What about having a nice, dull dinner with me tonight. Scrabble, Knock-knock jokes, Anecdotes about famous dead Italians....
And I'll bring my entourage...
What have you been doing?
Catholic girls are scary...
Oh Hudson...
Da Vinci made the real directions in a secret script that I decoded. The way the machine is running now, the gold will produce too quickly, clog, and the machine will shut itself down.  Isn't it wonderful?
Cat got his tongue?
How many times do I have to say it?  I didn't put the hit on Little Eddie... Never had anything against that kooky chimp.  I actually found him, "endearing."
Haven't you ever seen, like David Niven?  You know tiptoe in, tiptoe out.
For those kind of wages, I could have built the factory in America! They're Vietnamese, can't we just give them more Bart Simpson shirts? I hear depressing news like this and I want to commit genocide!  Alfred, hold my calls.  So, Hawk! The Hawkster!  What do you think of the vehicle?
Why do you show your parole officer such disrespect? Especially after I got you such a nice job.
You killed a friend.  Why should I help you go for the gold?
Damnit, I hate this!  I'm a cat burglar!  Nobody said anything about this fight-to-the-death shit.
If you do anything to my friend...
The Daddy-Oh!
Nobody told me! Nobody told me! You sold all of our stock?
I had twenty thousand shares! I'd be a millionaire now!
Yeah, yeah. Say, you won't tell anyone about me, will you?
That smart?!
Why on earth would they want a nitwit to be president?
...Hello?
About seven minutes.
Ol' satchel-butt...
-- and she's dynamite!
What a horrible little person.
A little naive perhaps but -- thank you -- armed with determination, a solid work ethic, and an indomitable belief in the future --
-- these were the values that were instilled in me while I was growing up in a little town you've probably never heard of --
-- A Muncie girl! Can you beat that!
The picture was fine! It's what that knuckle-headed dame wrote underneath! Of all the irresponsible... Amy, take this down: Dear Miss Archer. I call you 'Miss' because you seem to have 'missed' the boat completely on this one! How on earth would you know whether I'm an imbecile when you don't even have the guts to come in here and interview me man to man! No, change 'guts' to 'courage.' No, make it 'common decency.' These wild speculations about my intelligence --
Well, I --
Oh, is that it!
I believe in you, Norville -- At least I believe in your... intentions --
Oh yes! In Muncie!
Oh, I don't know. Maybe I was just a fast-talking career gal who thought she was one of the boys --
They're going to discharge eight percent of the work force here at Hudsucker. Why, in New York alone that means eighteen hundred people out of work, people with wives and children and families --
You mean you know about this?
Your i --
Shutup! -- but then I figured out you were a swell guy, a little slow maybe, but a swell guy! Well, maybe you're not so slow, but you're not so swell either and it looks like you're an imbecile after --
Shutup! -- after all! You haven't talked to me for a week and now I'm going to say my piece. I've got a prediction for you, Norville Barnes: I predict that since you've decided to dedicate yourself to greed and sloth and everything bad, you're going to lose all the good things that your good ideas brought you. You're going to throw them all away chasing after money and ease and the respect of a Board that wouldn't give you the time of day if you... if you...
Aww, what's the difference. I'm all washed up... When you're dead, ya stay dead... Hey, fella!
Muncie.
Terrific.
Yeah, daddy, that's a roger, but we don't sell alcohol.
You know what they're doin' now, Lou.
This is the most idiotic thing I've ever seen in my life!
And what do you mean barging in here and taking up my valuable time! I've got a company to run here --
Awwww, buddy --
Aw, please, sir -- this job, it's all I got!
I understand if ya don't like the Buzz-Sucker! Just lemme keep my job, I'm prayin' to ya!
...It is?
But, Buzz, you know I never --
Mm. Well, say what you like about the man's ethics, he's a balls-to- the-wall businessman. Beat ya any way he can. Straight for the jugular. Very effective.
Yessir.
...Yeah, go ahead.
-- So we'd gone out to the Hamptons and the garden was in positive ruins!
...Who let you in?
You're fired.
You nitwit! I worked for three years on this deal!
Why you nitwit. You almost destroyed the most sensitive deal of my career!
That reminds me, Mr. Mu... uh, Sid. I never did give you that--
Finally.
No kiddin', Bennie. I got gas.
...and awduhs a light lunch.
...No money.
There are other doctors...Yes, other doctors...Better doctors...
No.  She was mindless but not like Miss Jessica.  But the Houngan cured her.
Thank you, Mrs. Rand.  I think you're every bit as nice as Wes says you are.
A missionary's widow?  It isn't very likely, is it?
-- and when my husband died I felt helpless. They disobeyed me -- things went from bad to worse. All my husband's dreams of good health, good sanitation, good morals for these sweet and gentle people seemed to die with him.  Then, almost accidentally, I discovered the secret of how to deal with them. There was a girl with a baby -- again and again I begged her to boil the drinking water. She never would. Then I told her the god, Shango, would be pleased and kill the evil spirits in the water if she boiled it. She boiled the water from then on.
She can never be cured?
Is this disease common in the tropics?
That will mean another interview, won't it?
-- But, you're an American?
I wondered about your different accents.  I'm still wondering about your names -- Rand and Holland.
As a matter of fact, it means the sugar syrup is ready to be poured off.  You'll have to excuse me.
Perhaps you ought to get on to the mill.
What in the world are you talking about?  Six ounces -- ?
Don't let it bother you so, Wes.
It's easy enough to read the thoughts of a newcomer. Everything seems beautiful because you don't understand.  Those flying fish -- they are not leaping for joy. They're jumping in terror.  Bigger fish want to eat them. That luminous water -- it takes its gleam from millions of tiny dead bodies. It's the glitter of putrescence.  There's no beauty here -- it's death and decay.
Why was the maid crying?
A figure of St. Sebastian.
And what is so alarming about the tower, Miss Connell?
Wesley can be very entertaining.
I've no sympathy with people who can't resist temptation.
I heard you playing.
I wanted to help you.
I took Mrs. Holland to the Houmfort.  I thought they might cure her.
And what happened then, Mrs. Rand?
Two things had happened, Mrs. Rand. One was that your daughter-in-law had been taken ill with a fever. The other thing -- completely disconnected -- was that you had wished her ill, because she had hurt your sons.
Darned right. Look here, Benj, whaddya make of this sequel to The Godfather? You think it's gonna work?
Well, gonna make a break for the hors d'oeuvres guy.
OK, OK, the defense rests.  Want another?
I've been thinking, Ben, about Wendy. I was going to ask if she'd come with me sometime to meet Dr. Woolens.
Good night.
Yikes -- I was hoping to wear this thing to the Halford's Friday.
What?
I have no idea.
Oh lord. You think I'm so dense. And now you want to be seen with your dense wife at the cocktail party. You want to wear that ridiculous shirt which doesn't go with those pants at all. You want to wear that, and you want me to shake hands with your friends and make conversation and dress up in an outfit that shows a lot of cleavage and you're not going to accord me the respect of talking honestly about this... You don't really know what this feels like.
This just isn't the best moment for this.
You have some marker, that's what I think, if you want to know the truth. You have some marker and you're going to put it on the house keys so that Janey can find them and then when I get back to the house I'll find the two of you in there and Wendy'll be able to hear you and Paul will be back and he'll hear you and I'll catch you, that's what I think. She'll be swearing and banging against the wall and I'll catch --
Hi dad.
Well dad, actually I thought I'd take the morning train on Thanksgiving -- got a lot of studying, papers, you know, lab experiments --
Anyone special? You know...
Um, Paul. On second thought, can you do me a favor and pretend I never said any of that.
See you.
Ah let the guy have his fun. What's the name of this girl with the Park Avenue address?
Yeah?
Maybe it's all for the better, you know? Yesterday, at dinner, well, she hasn't said anything... has she acted funny to you, I mean, have you noticed anything?
Listen, Benjamin Hood. I have obligations that precede your... from before you showed up. One or two, you know, good-natured encounters, that doesn't mean I'm... I'm not just some toy for you. When I remembered some chores I wanted to get done before the party, I just did them, that's all, because I wanted to do them before I saw Jimmy.
How you take it isn't all that interesting to me, Benjamin. I'm sorry --
Good-night dad.
-- 73
It's not the taxes I object to. It's all the fines and penalties.
That was a joke? You don't tell jokes.
Jesus, let me make it up to you -- I can do better than that, honestly --
That's fine. I wouldn't expect you to see it any other way.
You okay?
Hi mom.
They need the money for my band uniform at school.
I don't really need to practice. I just play a few notes, you know, so I thought maybe I'd stay in.
I used to know how to cook.
It's been a tremendously transformative year -- maybe a little controversial of course, but we're breaking down the old Unitarian barriers --
Arise and shine, young Hood.
Flame on, asshole.
How can you do that man?
You oughtta read this Hood, Nixon, our leader, all ye need know about the travails of life. Check out the Checkers speech stuff.
And whence has yon virginal maiden absconded?
Everything's gonna freeze, the big freeze.
No candy for me?
Come on Paulie, share the wealth. You copped 'em from her mom's stash anyway.
Why did you -- with Sandy?
You're parents at that party?
I don't know. Dad seems a little weird.
May I operate your telephonic apparatus?
It's a one-on-one kind of date thing.
Her name's Libbets.
Well, you can...
Want a drink?
Just after Leland Street.
Nice kid.
So far.
Will, you can't blame yourself.
Who's playing?
Oh, I shouldn't have...
I'm going back to the Lodge, Ellie. Still need to go through some of Kay Connell's school records.
How much closer would you say you were?
No.  But I covered it up.  I lied.
Sorry about...
That's right.
Randy Stetz?
He knew exactly what we'd be looking for. Made sure to cover up all his tracks.
No way.
I wish I could stick it out like you.  I just, with Trish and the kids...
Your friend's all business.
Did you love her?
"She was nice."  Wow.  That makes me all soft inside.  Ever occur to you she didn't love you back?
Stuff.
Hey...
She kept saying she was gonna get out of here.  Leave us all behind.  That <i>he</i> was going to take her!
She used some stupid code name.
Expensive dresses.  A heart necklace.
So you have the answers...
Who made us what we are?
I have not spoken to him...
So soon? Without any of those answers you so longed for?
And the vampires of the Theatre?
You held sway over them. They feared you. You wanted it to happen.
I want some more.
Why always on this night?
But you're the fairest by far.
Which of you did it? Which of you made me the way I am?
Why yours alone? Tell me how it was done!!!!
Yes. And I'll tell you something else! I've met someone who will make a better vampire than both of you.
Not you my dear.
Laudanum!
Why does he call you that?
You... fed on me?
But now's the time to end it, Louis. Now's the time to leave him.
Louis, look at me.
You never talked to me like that - in all these years.
You don't remember? Or you never knew.
They are ducklings, that will grow into swans. Whereas I must be the duckling forever.
You know her?
Mortals, mortals everywhere. And lots of drops to drink.
I've seen enough of this! I loathe it!
They would have killed you -
Diane!!!!
Vampires. We thrive on blood.
I wish I were. But if I were, what would I want with you?
Your perfect. Your bitter and you're strong.
You're body's dying. Pay no attention. It will take twenty minutes at most.
Read her thoughts.
You fool, what have you done?
Where are we?
What, no flowery speeches? About what a monster I am? What a vulgar fiend?
Lestat - finish this -
Lestat!
Claudia! Don't do this thing!!!
You'll come home with me Louis? Fro a little while... until I am myself again.
I didn't mean to let them do it... that Santiago, he tricked me...
It's false light, Lestat. It can't harm you...
You were going to kill me? Drink my blood?
You believe this, don't you? That you're a vampire? You really think...
Look at the gaslight. Don't tke your eyes off it. You will be drained to the point of death, but you must stay alive. Do you hear me?
Julie, we're talkin' suites!  That'll be just fine with us.
Wait...Did you say off-season?
I want off this island.
Stupid. Stupid.
Get lost, you scared me.
Titus, you're so stoned, you'd end up in Spain.
I got work to do. Take the bake elsewhere.
I thought you were out of town!
I think I just really hurt Ray's feelings.
That could break the machine.
I'm the King of the World.
Remind me to study real hard so someday this is normal and all that back there is somethin' I do for a weekend once every ten years.
No way.
No.
Karla!
What do you mean?
Be careful, Julie.
Julie, the boats are gone, the phones are down. There's no way off this place.
Ray, I can't...
You're the most beautiful woman in the bar tonight, Jules.
Voodoo.
You've got all these theories but where is he? Where? Where's your fisherman killer?
Don't kill me --
You sure?
The shower again?
I'm sorry.
Nah. I'll probably just be here studying for finals. The joys of summer school...  Are you okay?
Just take deep breaths and think of something happy from childhood.
What do you mean, Julie?
I trusted you.
...Why?
Pretty cool bar.
Tha's it.  I've decided.  I'm changing my major to finance.  And going to Wall Street.
Okay, I just didn't wanna get my hair wet.
Oh, look. Another day in paradise with Julie-your-tour-director...Miss Psychotic Episode.
Somebody...is a sick, fingerpainting psycho.
Come on, it'll be fun.
Well, there's some flaws in her...
Don't really have the market for something like this...  I can go two...two-fifty.
Hell, that's worth three, easy. And you got your waiting period.
You guys lost?
What's the matter, boy trouble?
Cool.
There's ten people on this whole island and they're all gonna end up in this Jacuzzi with us.
I'm just saying what all of you are thinking. It's bad enough gettin' rained out without having to hold her hand the whole time.
They're around...They just don't care about us 'cause we're the contest winners.  Let's go find Stoner Boy...Make his lazy butt hook us up with fishing poles or Ping-Pong paddles or something.
We'll only be a second, okay?
I'd like to, very much -- but it depends on what dispatches are waiting for me on the mainland.
I'll go up and take a look at the General - perhaps sit with him.
All the more reason to watch him. He's had some wild notions lately.
Goodbye.
If the wind shifts, if the sirocco blows -- the hot wind from the South -- all danger will be over in twenty-four hours.
You're just talking nonsense.
Perhaps I had better stay. I am tired.
I'm glad you and the General didn't have to leave us. We would feel quite deserted..
I know it must be hard. But you have relatives in London --you've got a whole world of living, ahead of you --
Oh, no - it's too delicious! You're making it up!
My father -- I'm alone, Oliver, completely alone!
There's no reason to decide any of us are going to die.
Poor child. These must be horrible days for you.
Has that girl -- has Thea ever told you where she comes from?
Has she spoken to you of her father and her mother?
Miss Wollsten shares the room with you?
The young man, Mr. Davis, seems to be some kind of an unofficial observer  a correspondent of some sort 
I mean, does one love a father because he is good and kind -or just because he is one's father?
Your father knew it too. But he was never sure how much was pretense.
When I tell him that you're unfit to live a normal life with normal people - a cataleptic!
No. No. I won't believe it. He's not dead.
Woman, what are you doing here?
He sleeps quietly. He died with a wine glass in his hand -- he died laughing -- a brave man, Drossos, like his father before him.
I'm a woman -- a lonely woman. I have few friends.
No, I want more than that. I beg you General, make sure --drive a knife through my heart -- anything.
Was she ill before that girl came into your household?
She is not there. The coffin is gone.
Well, at any rate, I would like to say goodbye to the girl.
I had a notion you had become selfappointed chaperone lately  why?
That's ridiculous -- Thea's lovely, gentle -
Well, tell, him.
Because she loved him.  I know him, Thea. Believe me, he is not a cruel man.
Let me tell him. When he knows you are his child, he'll forget these insane notions -
I'm not crying, Mr. Potter.
Times are bad, Mr. Potter. A lot of these people are out of work.
Mr. Potter, what makes you such a hard-skulled character? You have no family  no children. You can't begin to spend all the money you've got.
Know you? Are you kiddin'? I've been looking all over town trying to find you. I saw your car piled into that tree down there, and I thought maybe . . . Hey, your mouth's bleeding; are you sure you're all right?
I told you  I'm your guardian angel. I know everything about you.
By letting me help you.
What'd you say?
What did you say?
It's stopped snowing out, hasn't it? What's happened here?  Come on, soon as these clothes of ours are dry . . .
You have no car.
Oh, I don't know. Either I'm off my nut, or he is . . .  . . . or you are!
What's the matter with him. I never saw Nick act like that before.
Oh, yeah. Hey, little fellow  you worry me. You got someplace to sleep?
No.
Look, I think maybe you better not mention getting your wings around here.
Yeah, yeah, I know. You told me that. What else are you? What . . . are you a hypnotist?
She's . . .
Why, yes. This is amazing.
A boy?
Oh, you mean the kid that had his ears slapped back by the druggist.
I know. I know. He didn't go.
. . . two of them as they were about to crash into a transport full of soldiers.
Sir . . . If I should accomplish this mission  I mean  might I perhaps win my wings? I've been waiting for over two hundred years now, sir  and people are beginning to talk.
The Adventures of Tom Sawyer.
Oh, Mother, Mother, please help me. Something terrible's happened to me. I don't know what it is. Something's happened to everybody. Please let me come in. Keep me here until I get over it.
Today, over at the house.
Look, Daddy . . . paste it.
I'm not sleepy. I want to look at my flower.
Old college graduate now, huh?
Goodbye, everybody!
He's gone. Don't worry. His name is Welch. He don't come in to my place no more.
She's swell.
Hmmm . . .
Sure  Sam Wainwright.
Yes. Sam's crazy about Mary.
Yes, sir. They have the diphtheria there, haven't they, sir?
No . . . No . . . No. . .
Mr. Gower! Mr. Gower! This is George Bailey! Don't you know me?
Well, no younger than I was.
Oh, well, you know what I've always talked about  build things . . . design new buildings  plan modern cities  all that stuff I was talking about.
Got a match?
Mary . . . Mary, I'm sorry. I've got to go.
She's home cooking the fatted calf. Come on, let's go.
Two cents worth of shoelaces?
George, can I see you for a second?
No, George, don't . . .
I know, but . . .
Say hello to New York for me.
Violet Bick!
Hello.
Well, what do you know  wife.
Oh, thank you, George, old boy, old boy. Now, look  if you'll point me in the right direction . . . would you do that? George?
What is this, Uncle Billy? A holiday?
Why didn't you call me?
When?
You wouldn't mind living in the nicest house in town, buying your wife a lot of fine clothes, a couple of business trips to New York a year, maybe once in a while Europe. You wouldn't mind that, would you, George?
Sure, sure, sure. You go on home and talk about it to your wife.
I'm not very good at this.
Eighteen.
Too young or too old?
Okay, then, I'll throw a rock at the old Granville house.
I'll take it. And then what?
They're way downtown. They'd be on my side, too.
When did you get back?
Mary Hatch, why in the world did you ever marry a guy like me?
Is it snowing?
Zuzu! What's the matter with Zuzu?
Oh, George, George, George.
Oh, George, George!
Pop, can I have the car? I'm going to take over a lot of plates and things.
Oh, Mom  I'm chairman of the eats committee and we only need a couple of dozen.
You forgot something.
How fast does this go?
Great!  Find one for me.
My hair's getting wet!
I can't wait to get there.
Maybe by now they are.
If you're beached, why are we doing this?  For practice?
Turkeys!  Eat wind!
Over here.  I want you to meet somebody.
We're carrying weight.
Coming up!  Give way!
I don't know.
How're we going to do that floating on this garbage...?
Chief Brody -- can we go?  Please?
Diver's camera.  Tom Andrews brought it up from under that abandoned cruiser.
Rich people.  Home port is Newport, Rhode Island.
Chief?
Well, what the hell -- might be something worth seeing.  Take it somewhere and see if there's film in it....
How long ago?
I don't know about him -- I'm going down to the dock, maybe go sailing.
You stay here a minute.
Jesus, don't freeze on me.  What about the others?
Dad, I'm sorry....
May I have this dance?
It came up during the meeting.
What have you seen before?  This is nothing.  Seaweed.  Mud.  Some- thing in the lens.
What makes you think there might be?
This is a mammal, not a fish.
Probably.
Where the hell were you?
Listen -- what are you doing later?
Let's get the kid home.
Thank you.  I'll tell him.
Sort of -- Mathew Hooper is aboard the research vessel Aurora, presently in the Antarctic Ocean, and won't be in radio range until half-past next spring.
Oww!
Found one of the missing victims from that boat deal.
No.
They have no right to treat you like that.  You've given them every- thing.  For four years, you've protected this town, the people on this island....
I'll give notice.
Are you serious?
Martin, could you wait here for a few minutes while we make up our minds about something?
There's a bunch of Kids day-sailing that way.  Turn them back to port.
When?
Can I go with you today?
Hang on!
It killed her.  It ate her.
We're going to die.
You're not going out right away, are you?
Me neither.
The wind drift is lateral.
Mmmmmm.
Be careful....
Too hot tor those two?  I can't believe it.
I don't care.
Mike and Larry are racing! Loser goes home alone!
He's got to help or it won't work.
Who wouldn't.
You're going out.
Look -- if you're going to get in the way, you can just go home.
Why don't you take a rest, Brian?
It hasn't adjusted.
Go on, Doctor.
You see the three-quarter socket?
That macho pompous English --
My imagination isn't that good.
You called, Doctor?
And what else is bothering you?
Sure.  Want to try that new Italian place?
They're coming with us?
Let's head to the gate and work our way back.
What's wrong?
Swim where?  Out there?  Oh, no, forget it, not me!  You go, I'm staying.
You amaze me.  I'm more scared than you.
I can use a shot of what he's got.
You want me to stay?
Finally.
Recovering nicely.
They said you'd be here.
No, we'll go through here.
It's too soon to move him.
It's no use.  They won't come into the lagoon.
That's a load of codswopple.  A Great White doesn't fear man.  It doesn't fear beast.  It's an orgy of food and blood.
You can get killed!
Calvin, let me go down there and kill the bastard.
I will.
Lunch for Whitey.  Something to munch on in case things get dicey.
I insist you get rid of that bomb.
Not at all.
That's what life is, Doctor. Full of chances to hurt yourself, or somebody else.
That's because I am the shark.
Well, Doctor.  You've got your shark.
Give me a ride?
Sean.  Sean, where are you?
Hi, Mike.
'Course they're also so rich.
I haven't seen that much, but so far it looks great.
How come?
This is where to be.  High and dry.
Sean, do you have herpes?
I know!  We can take the gondola ride!
Did you see that?
Yeah, well I didn't!
Your friend Overman picked a hell of a time to come back.
Reach for the limit I always say.
I'll go with you.
I'll stay out of your way.  I won't interfere.
He's big, Hutton.  You never saw anything so big.  Watch yourself.
That's impossible.
Yeah, we'll find something for you.  Shoveling shark shit or something.
Hey, I'm proud of you, kid.
Yeah, he'll really go for that.
I bought him his first legal drink. He got so pissed that night....
He was such a good-natured kid... Always going out of his way....
Where are you going?
Big unveiling ceremony in a couple of weeks....
I miss him, Matt.  I still can't believe he's gone.
Don't give me that preoccupied scientist crap.  I'm trying to get ready for....
Close the door.
It'll grow on you.
I could use a half-dozen more arms ...I've only got two weeks to get this thing finished....
Give it some time, Ellen...See what happens.
We have three months of work and approximately no money left to support it....
I see what you're doing....
Are you all right?
The fish.  Check it....
I like Grandma's cooking....
I'll be all right, Michael.
I enjoy his company....
That's it?  Good...I thought you'd break out the champagne....
It's late....
You hungry?
It got him....
I...I can't explain it.  It's just something I feel.
Sometimes I think I'm going crazy. The nightmares....
How can you just take the plane like this?
I'm only doing this to get out of my family's hair....
I have two right feet.
I could take some time off....
You sure you don't need glasses?
Can you keep a secret?  Something no one else knows?
It was theirs anyway.  I 11 buy us all a drink....
When we find her we'll radio her position...The Coast Guard will pick her up.  Don't worry....
Hell, that wasn't half bad.. Get going...I'll keep it busy....
Jake tells me you're going to have to fly for the rest of your life to pay off what you lost at the crap table....
I don't know what the hell to say....
Would you talk to her?  She's got it in her head that the shark came for him.  She still blames it for my father's death....
Maybe it's the tags that suck....
I stuck them on, man....
Sharp shirt, Jake....
What for?  We've got a job to finish ...Why are you making the monitor?
When I got the grant.....
When I invited you...
I thought we were planning a long rosy future together.
What are we getting out of this old bucket?
How long?
Half don't...Bring her about....
He gambles...He likes a good time...I see him around....
Shit....
Holy Christ....
All the time....
Theory, partner...If it responds to external electrical impulse, it might respond to one coming from inside it...Confuse it...Drive it away....
Wait for the sucker to charge, then hit the switch.  Just like taking a picture.
It's my fault...I have to....
Jake.
Who grows more beautiful....
Now wait a minute... I'm being serious here....
She's in management....
Manage the whole damn place some day. I'm looking forward to living in the style to which I would like to become accustomed....
Woman has taste....
Did you bring it with you?
No, Sir. I haven't started till Monday. I'm a "tourist."
What do you think?
Yeah, he can go ...
We're going.
I had one <u>puff</u> on a <u>pipe</u>.
Did I say he did?
Stop it.
She wasn't lying about the van.
Nothing you gotta say do I wanna hear right now. So save yourself saying it.
I'm already familiar with Taylor's opinion.
That's a very stupid question, Ross.
Everything you say sounds reason- able. But there's also a reason- able explanation for the opposite.
Where's your watch?
How do you know her hair's black?
Then <u>where's the body</u>? .. Where's the body, and <u>why's he hidden it</u>?
She's <u>not</u> "missing." Did she shout? Did she scream? Did he coerce her? <u>No</u>. She left of her own free will .. And if she gets on a plane and goes to Peru with the prick, she's still not missing. You got no case, John.
Don't underestimate me .. the Mayor's pissed - but that's nothing to do with this - sit down - How many times have you been up at that institute?
I never asked if he could "see." I just asked one or two of the stud- ents if they remembered anything?
Week or two.  Musta been on the ker- osene.  Stinks like a diesel engine.
Alright, gentlemen, I'm gonna leave you. I got a couple of questions for the paper, Serg- eant? Mind if I swing by later, wring out a tea-bag with you?
As recent as we have .. What ex- actly is your interest in Amber?
Then what are you hoping I'm gon- na do? Dissuade, or persuade you?
Well, apparently, she saw Amber the weekend she left, & was briefly in the room with the guy she left with.
You must have some idea about him.
Is there anything else you can tell me? Anything about him or her? Doesn't matter how small?
I'm sorry. I'll get my things.
What are you reading?
Oh.
"Thoughts that lie too deep for tears."
I know what you're like ..
You know? How do you know?
Why can't I stay with you?
He doesn't need my help.
When did John divorce?
What was she like?
Is that Margie?
Bobby's out .. What's the hurry?
You want something, darling?
She married some English prick.
Where do you fit in, Trimble?
The power move is to go unannounced.  Black suit, right?
"Dad says we gwan sleep on it.
King of the Housecalls! Master of the Living Room!
Well, no you didn't --
I have to finish my job --
Don't say it.  We're both ragged out right now.
Didn't hear it.
You've never been alone and you can't be alone --
No one has ever dumped me.
Let me think about that.  Want something to drink?
Okay. San Diego just came in with a last-minute scenario.  It's big.
Reporters, Jerry.  They been callin' all night.
Now what did you lose?
Dorothy, let me tell you something, we are back. We are so very very back.  I re-signed Cush. We're set.
It's all going to work.  We're going to save the world.
Don't worry about me.  I can get jobs --
Truth?
I'm working with you because of that memo...
No.  No don't feel like Clarence Thomas.
Well, good evening.
Look, the other night, I want to apologize.
We're two people working together and we can't have an atmosphere.
I mean, the other night was... I felt like you understood something I could barely even say, something way down deep in the murk --  -- but we have a company here to think about.  I won't ever take advantage of you in that way again.
Wow.  That's more than a dress. That's an Audrey Hepburn movie.
Okay. Wait here a second.  Do we really want to do this?
What --
I took advantage of you and worst of all, I'm not alone. I did this with a kid.  I was just on some ride where I thought I was in 1ove enough for both of us.  I did this.  And at least I can do something about it now.
What if it's true?  "Great at friendship bad at intimacy." I mean, come on.  It's the theme of my bachelor film --
I don't like to give up.
He just lost his best client.  He called from the plane.  I invited the guy over.
I... I love everybody, man.  I love my wife.  My kids.  Little Tyson. My new baby Kaydee.  My brother Tee Pee. I love my friends, my teammates, who am I leaving out?
Alright, we're just getting started on my list of things you need to know. Take notes if you want to.
Show.  Me.  The.  Money.
Rod --
See this jacket I'm wearing?  You like it?  I don't really need it, because I'm CLOAKED IN FAILURE. I lost the number one draft pick the night before the draft. They will teach my story to other agents on "do not do this" day in agent school. Why? Let's recap. Because a hockey player's kid made me feel like a superficial jerk, I had two slices of bad pizza, went to bed, grew a conscience and wrote a 25-page Manifesto of Doom!
Man, I got a shelf life of ten years, tops!  My next contract's gotta bring me the dollars that'11 last me and mine a very long time. I'm out of this sport in five years.  What's my family gonna live on? What you get me.  So I don't want to hear about ya shit, your "nya nya nya."
I got there from "coin," dude. Coin, coin... kwaaaan.
No, I air-dry.
Is that your porty or mine?
"Love me love me love me... put me on t.v."  That's the iconography of rascism, man!
Can I ask you a question totally unrelated to your career?
Oh I know plenty.  I was raised by a single mother.
Then you gotta have The Talk.
Why not --
I think so.
I uh... don't think we're quite at your pitch yet.
Marcee, things are changing around here.  You and Rod will have my total personal attention.
I'll go back to them.
Keep the phone open.  I'll call back. Stay calm. He's got some good doctors out there.
I'm fine.  What's up?
Hi.
You said "fuck".
Now go kiss your daddy, quick.
After what you've seen today, you really think your son could be alive?
Well, I'm no aviation specialist. But I do know it's hell of a lot lower than anyone else.
How much weight have you lost?
You hate to swim.
I know you liked Ben. I had no right to...
Well what?
We should try fishing again.
You see, that's just the thing. Paul and I have special permission to fly low.
Going to the coast was Alan's idea. If he's alive, thats where he's headed.
That was Isla Nublar. This is Isla Sorna. The second island.
So Mr. Kirby, tell me, when you climbed K2, did you base camp at 25- or 30,000 feet?
Eric!
How would you classify it?
We need to keep moving.
Hmm?
Good luck with the fund raising.
They'll never make it. I mean, they can't manage when the cable goes out.
The first one. Before you where on the island. You liked dinosaurs back then.
When InGen cleared out, they left a lot of stuff behind.
Is that all it's been? I thought it was longer.
How much of this island have you explored?
We need to head for the coast.
What can I do for you, Mr. Kirby?
That's a very nice offer, Mr. Kirby, but I'm afraid I'm much to busy. If you like I can refer you to a number of highly qualified...
We needed somebody who knew the lay of the land. Somebody who'd been to this island before.
How did you know?
But alone?  We always had great success together, you and I.
Sorry.  We were saying?
Is there an antidote?
Why didn't you tell us about these guys, Ian?!
I didn't know you -- weren't well.
I don't believe you.
I'm not going, John.
Why wouldn't they?  Look at hyenas, jackals, nearly all species of predator birds --
I can't tell you.  But I'll be back within a week.
Is that kid still bothering you?
You know, at the bus stop.  With the hair?
I could come with you.
"InGen."  What's InGen?
Are you all right?!  Anything broken?
Dad!
Carnivores hunt near stream beds.  Do you want to set up base camp or an all-you-can-eat people bar?
What?
Had to.  To keep him still for the trip.
Do you think the rex might have the infant with it?
We took to the rock.
It's... behind... us.
If your university felt you were causing it embarrassment by selling wild stories to Hard Copy, I hardly see how I am to--
What's he got in there?
You know how to work a radio, don't you?
She's gutty.
We can't stay in here!
This is single-wall construction! It's just a shack!
Just -- flawed.  Very deeply flawed.
Somewhere on this island, there exits the greatest predator that ever lived.  And the second greatest predator must take him down.
Oh, God.
You know, even if we do get those tapes back, people are going to say it's just another hoax.  Ian Malcolm's alien autopsy.
Hey, I wouldn't want to spook the woolly mammoths.
He doesn't need a friend, he needs a shrink.
That storm center hasn't dissipated or changed course. We're going to have to cut the tour short, I'm afraid. Pick it up again tomorrow where we left off.
We're talking, my dear, about a calculated risk, which is the only option left to us.  We will never find the command NEDRY used.  He covered his tracks far too well, and I think it's obvious he's not coming back.  So shutting down the system - -
- - shutting down the system is the only way to guarantee wiping out everything he did. If I understand correctly, all the system will come back on their original start-up modes correct?
How many lines of code are there?
But would we get the phones back?
How long will this take?
Yours was fully illustrated, honey.
Doctors, if you please - - I have to insist we get moving.
They are?  I'll be damned.
Malcolm's okay for now.  I gave him a shot of morphine.
But with this place, I - - I wanted to give  them something real, something that wasn't an illusion, something they could see and  touch.  An aim devoid of  merit.
Four complete skeletons. . . . such a small area. . . the same time horizon - -
Postmortem contraction of the posterior neck ligaments.  Velociraptor?
Well, not one of those, well yeah, a possibly one at some point could be a good thing.  What's so wrong with kids?
Why would they care what we think?
Elm that's it, it explains the periodicity, the - -
- - what happens is that after a while, the stones get smooth, every six weeks, so the animal regurgitates them - -
Dr. Sattler, I've seen a lot of animal attacks.  People just disappear.  No blood, no trace.  	That's the way it happens.
I'm going with you.
Come on, let's go.
C'mon on, this way.
Hola, Juanito
Are they heavy?
These look kind of familiar.
It's just like coming out of a tree house.  Did your dad ever build you a tree house, Tim, eh?
Me too.  Okay.  Well, the main thing about climbing is never, never look down, never.
It's a bit of a climb.  You guys think you can make it?
By the way, Dr. Sattler - she's not like, uh, available, is she? - -
Yeah, they hate me.
Oh my God!
And who in God's name do you think you are....?
That thing's got a what, twenty-five, twenty-seven foot neck?
Robert.  Robert Muldoon, my game warden from Kenya.  Bit of an alarmist, I'm afraid, But he's dealt with the raptors more than anyone.
He's knocked out!  He's knocked out!  Dr. Grant!  Dr. Grant!  Daddy, daddy!
It's safe?
It's safe.
All night?
I am gonna have to find the others and get you to a doctor.  Will you look after Tim, Lex?
I am totally unappreciated in my time.  We can run the whole park from this room, with minimal staff, for up to three days.  You think that kind of automation is easy? Or cheap? You know anybody who can network eight Connection Machines and de-bug two million lines of code for what I bid this job?  Because I'd sure as hell like to see them try.
What's going to happen to the goat?  He's going to eat the goat?!
I'm sorry - - I'm sorry - -
I don't know, I don't know.  I'm sorry - -
That's not funny.
I don't think the people who live around here would like that very much...
Okay... well... I think it's this way...
There doesn't seem to be any water damage. Kind of cozy, actually.
Two.
I can't wait to hear your opening argument.	"Ladies and Gentlemen	of the Jury... the Defense will prove that Jason Voorhees did not kill all of these people. They, in fact, committed mass suicide and then buried themselves in his back yard..."
It's still on.
A house?
And this hand... it... it slashed Doctor Layton's throat... and the Deputy. Then it grabbed Danny by the head...  And it pulled his head right down into his chest... I couldn't... Hayes lays a hand his shoulder.
So... why can't Jason get a fair trial?
You think that's going to work?
This is bad, Joe. The Prosecution is already putting together a team of psychiatric specialists. They'll argue exactly the opposite. They'll say he's just pretending to be catatonic and he's completely sane.
Well, that's it. He'll be asleep in a few minutes, but his first REM-cycle probably won't kick in for another hour or so.  Is there a place we can get something to eat in this town?
See this?
So you think it might counteract Krueger's ability to make us hallucinate?
My assistants, I presume.
You look like brothers.
Preliminary investigations may already be underway.
-- Ah, but what if it <u>wasn't</u>?
I've read your stories.  They're fantastic.
When I deliver a message the very act of delivering it, you might say, gives it an official stamp, and only in this way are both the sender and the receiver satisfied that it was delivered at all.
Good morning --  Or should I say good afternoon?
Oh, don't they?  I think you underestimate my station in this office and overrate your own.
It's my place to offer advice, not yours -- and by advising the Chief Clerk of your unpunctuality it's certainly not my situation that's compromised, if that's what you're implying.
I'm Kafka -- I work upstairs in Accident --
Well -- nice to know life exists outside the office.
-- I don't know the Musil district.
And you still maintain -- what? That he was murdered.
You're shocked at the thought of Eduard tossing a bomb through a window.
When you only see someone sitting at a desk all day, it's liable to create a false impression.
How often does one of our clerks have business in the house of records?
I know better than you what people will say when they have to.  When they brought me in for questioning I informed on my friends the very first day.
Would you describe your relationship with the dead man as close?
I'll bear that in mind.
What's the matter with you?
Still, we're probably closer to you at the moment than any of your fellow human beings.
That's <u>mad</u>.
-- Gabriela, on the other hand, had made an enemy of this man Burgel.
-- You seem amused.
I believe we've exceeded his expectations.
May I ask where your two warders are?
-- And the new patients they bring me aren't usually as dexterous as you've been in evading us.  Not perfect specimens by any means, but not the type of person who'll be missed either.
Once a file's been sent to the Caste, is it possible to recall it for review?
What good are records if they're not open for public inspection?
Ludwig.
Women are all you have on your mind!
Then that's the place for us!
Can I see the map? My father spoke of references to a Beast God ...
I thought that with your assistance we could have the premiere at the Albert Hall. We'll take out a full page ad in Variety - "The Lord Darrow Benefit screening". We'll invite the King of England - hell, we'll get the whole Royal Family along! It'd be good for them and good for us!
Out! Out! All of you! We have been issued with an exclusive permit -
No, it's not ok! We're not about to be robbed blind by some two-bit hustler on the make!
Where do I charter a boat?
Give it back!
I tell you it doesn't exist!
They're stoking the boilers. As soon as we've got some steam, we're outta here.
Just take it easy .-- Where are the others?
Did you see her?
I'm calling a wrap. We're heading back to the ship.
Bree -- honey - please, we're waiting for someone.
Honey, a couple of years ago, with Jane and Frankie? -- Jane sent me a Dumper --
Arlyn, just tell me, did Jane have a dumper, one of her regular Johns?
Why? She's a junkie.
Yes?
-- May I? It's so --
Not young; he wasn't young -- gray at the temples, he -- well actually he looked like you.
I know: it's ridiculous. But it's tearing me up and I don't know why. And look, all right, I came here didn't I? And if I have to, I'll keep coming here, the works, and talk about my mummy and my daddy and I'll even pay for it, but will you kindly for God's sakes say something?
Guess!
Why isn't he locked up?
No, you're frightened, you're pretending. Well -- Klute knows about me then. Does everybody know, can you tell me?
You said that.
Honest?
Is that how you met the Dumper? -- Someone else gave --
Klute, tell me, what's your bag? Are you a talker, or a button man or a doubler, or maybe you like them very young -- children -- or get your chest walked around with high-heeled shoes, or have us watch you tinkle? Or --
What? This?
Can't you get him?
About the dumper, didn't he tell you that?
I thought you were going back to the apartment.
What're you gonna do next?
How can you do it to yourself?
You're right, I don't understand. Explain it to me.  You were scared. Arlyn Page, that scared you. Well it should; that's death. So what did you do, you ran straight for it, death. Ligourin kills women.
I saw Mr. Faber.  You remember Mr. Faber, don't you?
Oh Jesus. Oh Jesus.
Bree --
Well suppose I hadn't come downstairs. Would you just have folded up and sneaked away?
Look at me. I'm pretty and sort of clever and very well intentioned, and dear God I'd tear your heart out!
How can you not think so? You know the things I can do.
All right, suppose it wasn't Tom Grunemann; where does that get you?
I've been up country, you know my summer place, my camp. I don't even have a telephone there. This morning they sent a messenger out, that you'd been trying to call me.
Some mistake perhaps that --
You said he was no possible connection with Tom. The Page girl told you that, not Tom.
You were hired to look for Tom, not someone.
It's a beautiful day in Tuscarora - I don't envy you that humidity in the city.
Have you discussed this with them?
I've always respected Bree.  I'd like to make something clear.
No. She had every good intention of it -- coming to me as a private patient, getting out of the life, devoting herself to an acting career.
Klute. With a K. K - L - U -
I know Tom Grunemann.
No.
He's right you know. Waiting for the pusher, she'd tell you anything.
That's how the other one died, you know. In the water.
Show.
On earth.
What if she forgets?
You're late.
Well, I see the Yankees finally won a game.
Yeah?
I'm sorry.
There, okay? Now that's just plain old hamburger.
Not on your life.  That's it. I've had it with crap around this house.  From now on, no more pizza!  Get it?  Starting right now you can eat real food like a normal human being!
I want my...mm...ommy...I want mmmy...mommy...
Daddy?
I don't think so.
Yes?
Objection.
See.  That's my name.
Wow!  That's neat.   Can I sit in it?
No, son.  Daddy and mommy will never get remarried.
Was there apple juice when you were little?
Was there Burger King?
Billy, sometimes when a mother and a father are divorced, there's a discussion about who the child should live with, the mother or the father.  Now there is a man who is very wise.  He's called a judge.  And a judge has a lot of experience with divorces and he decides who it would be best for the child to live with.
Because...Well, that's what he does.  He's a very powerful man.
Bigger than a principal.  The judge sits in robes in a big chair.. The judge has thought a lot about us, about you and me and your mom, and he has decided...  ...he has decided that it would be best for you to live with your mom Joanna in her apartment.  And I'm very lucky.  Because even though you'll live with your mom Joanna I'll get to see you once a week for dinner and a couple of weekends a month.
Your mom knows all about The Face, okay?  Don't worry, she'll tell The Face to beat it.
Now then, Mrs. Kramer, would you tell the court how long you were married?
Mr. Kramer, why did you set up residence in New York?
Objection.
So do I.
Now then, Mrs. Kramer, you said you were married seven years. Is that correct?
In all that time did your husband ever strike you or abuse you physically in any way.
Was he unfaithful?
Did he ever fail to provide for you?
Would you speak up, Mrs. Kramer? I couldn't hear you.
I can't help but feel somehow... it's my fault.  I keep thinking I could've done something-- stopped it...
I've seen him.
Ted, all my life I'd either been somebody's daughter or somebody's wife, or somebody else's mother. Then all of a sudden, I was a thirty-two-year-old, highly neurotic woman who had just walked out on her husband and child.  I went to California because that was about as far away as I could get.  Only... I guess it wasn't far enough. So I started going to a shrink.  Ted, I've had time to think. I've been through some changes. I've learned a lot about myself.
Ted, when we got married it was because I was twenty-seven years old and I thought I should get married and...when I had Billy it was because I thought I should have a baby...and I guess all I did was mess up my life and your life and--
After I left...when I was in California, I began to think, what kind of mother was I that I could walk out on my own child. It got to where I couldn't tell anybody about Billy--I couldn't stand that look in their faces when I said he wasn't living with me.  Finally it seemed like the most important thing in the world to come back here and prove to Billy and to me and to the world how much I loved him...And I did ...And I won.  Only...it was just another "should."  ...Sitting in that courtroom. Hearing everything you did, everything you went through... Something happened.  I guess it doesn't matter how much I love him, or how much you love him. I guess it's like you said, the only thing that counts is what's best for Billy.  I don't know, maybe that's all love is anyway... Ted, I think Billy should stay with you...
He's already got one mother, he doesn't need two...He's yours...  I won't fight you for him any more. He's yours...
Only can I still see him?
Okay...I think I'll go talk to my son now.  How do I look?
Ted, this may sound a little rough, but we've just landed the biggest account in the history of this agency, right? And now it's up to us--that's you and me --to deliver the goods.  Ted, you're my main man, and if I can't depend on you a hundred and ten percent, twenty-four hours a day, because you're worried about a kid with a runny nose--
Yes.
So...what's so terrible about that?
No.  No, I don't believe it. Jim O'Connor would never let anything like that happen.  He gave me my shot in this business. If it wasn't for Jim O'Connor I'd be--I don't know where I'd be. He's a wonderful man...
So, naturally, you assume that since Joanna left, that would be a compelling point against her, right?
But it doesn't work that way. A major decision was handed down by the Appellate Court in 1969--in the case of Haskins vs. Haskins.
And?
What?
Look, she walked out on her own child, right?  That's desertion, right? Mr. Shaunessy, I'm telling you it's an open and shut case.
Good.  You've hired yourself a hell of a lawyer, Mr. Kramer.  How old is the child?
Oh, Christ!
I lost him?  I lost him?
Mrs. Phillips, how long have you known Ted Kramer?
Don't worry.  I plan to have something within twenty-four hours, John.
How many?
You're on your own, understand?
C'mon, Thel.  So Charley had a little fling.  So what? All in all he was a pretty good husband.
She ever ask about me?
Hey, that's terrific.
Ted, what are you talking about?!
Ted, I don't understand a word you're saying.  Where's Joanna?
All quiet?
Where are you from?
And that day, your father got better. He named you Lhamo. "The Protector."
I do, now.
Where will you keep them?
He has been imprisoned, here in the Potala, Holiness.
Of the Tibetan delegations sent abroad, all have been turned away.
So, we must face China and all her might alone.
With much bloodshed.
Who am I?
The Four Noble Truths, as taught by the Lord Sakyamuni Buddha are: The Truth of Suffering The Truth of the Cause of Suffering, The Truth of the Cessation of Suffering, the Truth of the Way which leads to the cessation of Suffering.
Can I save the sheep from going to the market? So they don't die.
Do I have money?
Will we be in this war?
Where is Alsace?
Tell me.
America, we shall see.
Quite simple. Yes. Good.
Good day.
I turn you over again, today, Lhamo. One day, you will not be able to come running to us.
Do you think I must?
What does the butter spot feel like?
It is a story, you decide.
Maybe in the next life, the world will not need a Dalai Lama.
We have enemies.
These are dangerous times. They want the Dalai Lama to lead them.
You will not come?
You, kill me?
Did you love your husband, before you married?
Oh, my husband passed away almost two years ago.
Murders and rapes in the cities. People bomb planes... can the police stop them?  <u>No</u>.  But feed one little cow to a crocodile...
--<u>Who</u> <u>is</u> <u>he</u>?
They've been migrating north, Kelly, this lake connects to the ocean,--
<u>No</u>!!  What's with digging the holes?
You listen to me.  The only reason I'm letting you be part of this is 'cause you got the helicopter and the radar--
Is this a trick?
I brought a pork chop, maybe we could hang it around your neck for luck.
Was he a good man?
His head was just... bitten off.
Asia?  How... how could he get here?
What's that?
Just spit him back out.  Some shall live, some shall die, arbitrarily, sound like any higher power we know?
I can arrest you!!
Where is he?!
This time, <u>I'm</u> gonna kick your ass.
Keep enough tension to hold him up, Hector, we don't know if he can swim.
The more he thrashes, the better.
Almost here, Hector.  Don't forget to lift up the cow.
<u>No</u>.  Look.  He's got nothing left.
She didn't tell us about the other croc 'cause she was afraid we'd blow it's head off.
He was an Indo-pacific.
Hector.  What you just did... there was at least some sort of a death wish going on.
Didn't even <u>sound</u> good?
What?
Did you make anything of the tooth?
Why are you here?  Really.
The Museum of Natural History doesn't send out investigators to--
If this is who I <u>think</u> it is.  It <u>is</u>.
In Maine?
It's too dangerous for--
No.  U.S. Wildlife is on their way.
<u>Ow</u>.  Shit.
No thanks.
That's why you're here.  To get in the middle of something?
I'm not mushing it.
Really--
Calm down.
Just heard from Wildlife and Florida Fish And Game.  They should be here by four.
It can't work.
He doesn't seem to be swimming.  Is he swimming?
He's through fighting.  Look at him.
Get him onto shore.
Y'know, if we didn't live in separate worlds and... 
You think?
That was... y'know if the guy asks me can she kiss, now I'll be able to tell him if you can.
I'm ready when you are.
What's that?
Get back from the shore.  We know how fast he can leap out.
Now I'm gonna puke.
I can't.  I'll get Hector!!
Have you ever seen a dead body before, Ms. Scott?
And this is how he came to the boat?
You have a thing against museums?
They don't believe her.
Is this 'spose to make me take him more serious?
Was that like a homo-sexual remark?
Are you alright?
<u>Oh</u>...  No, no, I'm not angry I'm not, I'm just thrown, I'm...  I actually have an early lunch, so...
Sorry?
This was Myra's idea, wasn't it? Get me out of the office for a few days, until--
I don't like to be scared, Myra, I have a thing about fright, don't ever scare me.
<u>You</u>?
What'd I do?
Phone call, Clarice. It's God.
You missed Fourth Amendment law. Unlawful seizure, real juicy stuff. Where were you all afternoon?
Boy, is that smart...
Clarice - you did the best anybody could have for Catherine Martin. You stuck your neck out for her and you got your butt kicked for her and you tried. It's not your fault it ended this way.
Agent Starling! Telephone!
Mr. Krendler... Dr. Lecter trusts me. Or at least, he used to. If I could just -
He gave us a perfectly good description, and we're on it now, so we won't be needing your little novelty act any longer - or his, either. He's under close guard at the courthouse, pending a prison transfer. The next plane, Officer.
Maybe he lives in this, this Belvedere, Ohio, too! Maybe he saw her every day, and killed her sort of spontaneously. Maybe he just meant to... give her a 7-Up and talk about the choir. But then -
We're trying to interview all of the serial killers now in custody, for a psychobehavioral profile. Could be a big help in unsolved cases. Most of them have been happy to talk to us. They have a compulsion to boast, these people... Do you spook easily, Starling?
Why?
Okay, Starling. Let's have it.
What should I say? You did fine work. We'll wait on the lab.
When I told that sheriff we shouldn't talk in front of a woman, that really burned you, didn't it?  That was just smoke, Starling, I had to get rid of him. You did well in there.
All his victims are women... His obsession is women, he lives to hunt women. But not one women is hunting him - except me. I can walk in a woman's room and know three times as much about her as a man would.  I have to go to Belvedere.
Ohio is cold ground. Picked over, ten months ago. Our people worked it, so did the locals.
That's why they're all so big - because he needs a lot of skin! He keeps them alive to starve them awhile - to loosen their skin, so that -
They said she was just rags, like somebody -
You get to travel around and stuff? I mean, better places then this?
I am, yes.
Partially, yes. But Doctor, that's an active case, I'm not involved. If -
Reasonably so. Yes.
Why don't you ask me about Buffalo Bill?
His real name is Benjamin Raspail. A former patient of mine, whose romantic attachments ran to, shall we say, the exotic...? I didn't kill him, merely tucked him away. Very much as I found him, in that ridiculous car, in his own garage, after he's missed three appointments. You'd have him under "Missing Person" - which, in poor Raspail's case, could hardly be more true.
Who can say...? Best thing for him, really. His therapy was going nowhere.
And have them clomping about in my life? Oh dear, no... At that time I still had certain private amusements of my own.  How did you feel when you saw him, Clarice? May I call you Clarice?
Ahhh... Why?
Do you have something you use, when you need to get up your courage? Memories, tableaux... scenes from your early life?
Oh, a very naughty boy. Someone you and Jack Crawford are most anxious to meet.
Horses - and sheep...
Dr. Lecter, you find out everything. You couldn't have talked with this "William Rubin", even once, and come out knowing so little about him... You made him up, didn't you?
I think you were telling me the truth in Baltimore - or starting to. Tell me the rest now.
He kills w-
What is the first and principal thing he does, what need does he serve by killing?
I heard a strange sound...
Your lambs are still for now, Clarice, but not forever... You'll have to earn it again and again, this blessed silence. Because it's the plight that drives you, and the plight will never end.
Oh, that's clever, Dr. Danielson. Very humorous. You like the truth? Try this.  He kidnaps young women and kills them and rips their skin off. We don't want him to do that anymore. If you don't help me, just as fast as you can, then the Justice Department is going to ask publicly for a court order, We'll ask twice a day, just in time for the morning and evening news. And each one of our press conferences will focus on Dr. Danielson, over at Johns Hopkins, and how we're still hoping for his cooperation. And every time there's any news on the case - when Catherine Martin floats, when the next one floats, and the next one - why, we'll just issue another press release about good ol' Dr. Danielson, over at Johns Hopkins - complete with all his humorous fucking remarks.
Better known to his friends as the Death's-head Moth...
Are you alright?
Why didn't you bury those people?
They buried my ma & pa and my sisters. And Chingachgook - who found me with two French trappers - raised me up as his own.
The Bible. Monarchy. Many wrong ideas about the government of men. My father's people already know each man is his own nation. And only he can have dominion over himself. Not kings. No man is better than any other man.
What are you looking at, Mr. Poe?
They're going to hang you.  Why didn't you leave when you had the chance?
Webb's reinforcements will arrive or not.  If they do not arrive, the fort will fall. If that happens, stay close to your father.  The French will protect the officer class among the English.
What is it?
Are we safe?
And my compliments to you...
Will you go back to England?
But the man is guilty of sedition and subject to military justice and beyond pardon.
I'm embarrassed to be so indecisive... after so long apart and after you've traveled so far...
Some say that's the way of it.
I see...
They do not live their lives "by your leave."  ...They hack it out of the wilderness with their own two hands, burying their dead and their children along the way.
... compliments, Mr. Poe.  Take her and get out.
Colonel Munro sent him. He was one of our Mohawk allies.
What?!
Of course not!  And how is it you were nearby?
How long?
I don't understand!
That we did. John. But the horicane  is near trapped out.
I'll cover them from the top of the casement.
Let the children of the dead Colonel Munro go free and take the fire out of the English anger over the murder of their helpless ones.
So the Huron are the servants of the French?  To do what the French are shamed to do?
Magua would use the ways of Les Francais and the Yengeese...
Yes, Mr. Poe? So?
That judgment is not more important than their right under agreement with Webb to defend their farms & families... Major Heyward was at John Cameron's. He saw what it was.
I'll have none of that!  Montcalm is a soldier and a gentleman. Not a butcher.
Sergeant! Form three ranks!
We must... stop... soon. Women are... tired.  You... understand?
Three, four oxen... much wampum.
Yes.
Gold could be arranged.
I am deeply touched by such unusual and unexpected generosity... The fort is yours under the condition that we be given until dawn to bury our dead, prepare our men and women for their march and turn our wounded over to your surgeon.
Are you planning on working tomorrow?
What do you want me to say? That it all sounds mysterious?
Here.  Put this on.  You examine him.
Was there such a thing?
DeJesus!  A readout!
Doc eat already?
No, it's not going through. The intercom's busted.  I thought DeJesus fixed that?
I hit it.  But I can't see it!  Can you see it?!
Go on!
Your suit, Becky!
How's astronaut training?
I guess I figured if I was in their shoes that's what I would've done.
What can we do?
What about our quota?
Something wrong, Cobb?
What's wrong with it?
I can't tell you much about it, except that none of you show any symptoms.
Thank you, Martin.
What're you saying?  That we're not even going to be picked up tomorrow?
I'm telling you, it's the suits!
Who else...Sixpack.
Cute, DeJesus...Specimen cups?
Still bothering you?
What's going on?
Hey, Cobb...Man, why don't you take off your shirt and pants, man?  You should do that wearing what you're going to wear at the beach.
How'd you do that?
Bigger than DeJesus?  How?
The monster appears to be a genetic aberration...
Clear for pickup.
No...he's really sick.  I heard him last night.  The company will take that into consideration...
What is it?
Don't spend all day down there.
My pocket.  Check my pocket, will ya, honey?
I'll kill him!
The odds are one hundred to one so all we need is five grand.
Of course you will, sweetheart. This one, search this one. Ed finds the keys without any trouble.
The traffic warden went to the morgue and recognized Dog and his lot so that put us sort of in the clear. They got no case against us because there is no evidence against us.
Next time we do a job like this we gonna want more money, or we are going back to post offices and cars.
There are no others.
I don't know what you mean.
Inside, out-fuckin'-side. I don't give a shit, you get those guns because if you don't . . .
And JD is his dad, and owns the whole property?
Oh, thanks very much. And there had better be something there for us.
Nope.
Have you counted the money?
They were going to pay, then?
Did I say speak? And it's Mr Harry to you . . . Now don't disappoint me and chose your words carefully. You may speak.
You all right back there, mate?
Is that you, Dean?
We gotta get those guns.
So we have a bit of a problem, don't we?
So do you know these geezers well?
There's one steel gate as you go in but they never lock it.
What's that idiot doing next door?  We use your van. It's up some stairs this place, so we'll stick out like balls on a bulldog. Plank is going up first. There is a cage but it is never locked, is it Plank?
What the fuck did you do to Fauntleroy?
Willy, this is the last time, and don't let him know that you're here, otherwise he will be here all day, and get rid of him quick. We have work to do.
And the weed?
Yeah invitations, you know a pretty white piece of paper with your name on it.
I hope this is the right move.
Well, what did he say?
Tom?
The only item that connects us with the crime is sitting in your car which is sitting outside?
I think I would rather just turn them over.
Go on.
And that does include the amp?
What you telling us for? The only thing I care about is whether you get your rest in.
You went out six hours ago to buy a money counter and you come back carrying two bags of fertilizer. Alarm bells are ringing, Willy.
Joanie Orozco's telling the whole school she's like desperately in love with Santo Guerra.
I don't know what the big deal is.
--you're going to be on your own.
So I'm worried about you. I don't want you to end up in jail like your friends.
Private Johnson, are you unhappy in the Army?
Then how would you explain the fact that out of one hundred twenty people we tested, you're the only one who came up positive for drugs?
You don't sound too enthusiastic.
Please.
Because it's a job?
Do you think you've been discriminated against on this post?
Why don't you start with that?
So you knew this young man before?
Sergeant Major? How is Richie doing? Private Graves?
You're dismissed.
Did you know he was going to be there last night?
Charley Wade.
You got a cause of death?
A .45--
That's not the point.
Whole different story; isn't it?
Suppose not.
You'll get official notification when I make my decision. He is out the door--Otis pulls himself a beer as Carolyn steps back out--
It's a small post and they're phasing it out in two years, but I moved up in rank and--well, a command is a command.
They teaching that now?  Good. Only a couple of 'em held out--this man, John Horse, and his friend Wild Cat, and a fella name of Osceola. Army put all of them in prison and Osceola died, but them other two escaped and put together a fighting band and held out another ten, fifteen years. Beat Zach Taylor and a thousand troops at Lake Okeechobee.
Men worked for Santa Anna down there, waited out the Civil War. The land wasn't much to feed people on, so in 1870 they come north and put up at Fort Duncan and the men joined up what was called the Seminole Negro Indian Scouts. Best trackers either side of the border. Bandits, rustlers, Texas rednecks, Kiowa, Comanche--
They were in the Army. Like your father.
He's a pretty tough old man, huh?
Homework?
Not that I don't think you'd be good at it, but--you know--I wouldn't be disappointed if you decided to do something else with your life.
Bird flying south-you think he sees that line? Rattlesnake, javelina-- whatever you got--halfway across that line they don't start thinking different. So why should a man?
Never thought I'd see the day a buddy of mine was dating a woman with three up and three down on her shoulder.
You met her family? They gonna be cool about you being a white guy?
Mikey--
Seriously.
--warning. Not 'cause he had it in for the colored
Yeah. I bet he would.
I sprint the last quarter mile. You gentlemen don't have to keep up if you don't care to.
Your boys out there cooped up together, need somewhere they can let the steam out. If they're Black, there's not but one place in this town they feel welcome. Been that way since before you were born.
Well, you're the Man out there now, aren't you? It's your call.
Donde esta? Estoy perdido--[Where are you? I'm lost--]
Senora Cruz?
This girl has a child?
Rapidamente! Everybody in the world is going to see!
A casa de Porfirio Zayas. He used to be a doctor on the other side. Gunshot wounds, fixing babies--if you can pay he can handle it.
Every other damn thing in the country is called after Martin Luther King, they can't let our side have one measly park?
Your mother was a saint.
That's a matter of interpretation--
There was a faction pulling for that boy who was killed in the Gulf War-- Ruben--
I always wondered what you Mayors do when you're not cutting ribbons.
Floating around out here, playin' hell with them bass--play a little cards, play a little golf, drink some beer--
Was it Davy Crockett or Jim Bowie?
You don't remember anything else from that last night you saw him, do you?
He still living?
Don't think the Rangers are likely to find out any more than they already have.
I got Eddie Richter at the Sentinel to kill that story.
Steve called for you.
You got to be interested in somebody. All you do is work.
Did you come here to tell me how to run my business?
Why would I want to go there?
Mami, how old were you when my father--
There must have been somebody.
Yeah, that's the story of my life.
You mind if I ask a few questions about your husband? Roderick?
So you must remember Sheriff Wade.
He squeezed money out of you?
Pilar, is uhm--is Amado okay?
No. Is he sick?
I don't think you can take it personally--
I didn't understand the spot I was putting Roderick in.
Mom?
You got in late last night.
Time marches on.
Three months.
You built our patio while you  were on the county?
Got him here?
How come it feels the same?
Like your story is over.
You gonna tell your mother we been seeing each other?
I'm not having any more children. After Amado, I had some complications-- I can't get pregnant again, if that's what the rule is about--
You're out early.
Haven't seen much of you at the jail lately.
Yeah.
--but longhorns are hard to come by these days.
How am I gonna sell things if nobody comes by? This stretch of road runs between Nowheres and Nothin' Much.
Buffalo chips. Fella in Santa Fe told me he sells these as fast as the buffalo can squeeze 'em out.
They don't hand those medals out for hidin'in your foxhole. Would you buy this?
Like in nothing.  Nobody.  Nix.
I'm sure they'll have this place rigged.
Billy?  This was on Miller's forehead.  Any idea what it is?
That's Butterfield...
Take a look at this.
What did Vinovich say? Something about walking a path between --
Who did this?
D'Amour... D'Amour... Why do I know that name?
I don't want him getting in the way.
We've all of us waited too long to have the homecoming spoiled.
You didn't think it was just going to be you and me?  A lot of people believed in Nix. They haven't forgotten his promise.
Death.
Do you wish him to be amongst us?
Ever watched a man die?  If you watch very closely, you can sometimes see the soul escaping. And if you're very quick, you can catch it.
So do you.  You've seen the future. Haven't you?
Yes.  They weren't close, but they saw each other once in a while.  I think Philip believes all that stuff with the tarot cards.
What's the connection?
He's good.
Just curious.  Back to business.  Ever heard of a man called Nix?  Dorothea?
Flesh is a trap.  That's what he used to say.  Flesh is a trap and magic sets us free.  Why did you come back?
He taught all this to Swann?
Nothing's going to happen to you.
... oh... God...
... they believe you.
And this Butterfield guy--
Trickery and divinity.
They weren't worth a damn.
Great accent, by the way.  Is it Brooklyn?
Go away.
What are you, my mother?
Whatever I said, I didn't mean it, okay?  I get a few drinks inside me --
Then what do you want?
It's not a bad place.  Warm. Great view.
Left alone?  Somebody's been murdered.
Fuck regrettable!  I want to know why.
I like to know why things happen.
You rigged the illusion to fail, right?
And then... because I was getting too close to something --  --or someone, you called Swann
Right.  And he's dead, isn't he?  I saw it on the news. Jennifer doesn't know.  And frankly, this isn't the best tine for her to be told.
You've taken some strange journeys in your life.
Harry D'Amour.
I'm in from New York.  I came to see Swann.
I don't think so.  You need me alive.
This is where we killed him.
You don't think I've got it to give?
Don't touch me.  He's got... got into my head.
Because you've got nothing else to live for.
Ok.
What did you study?
Hi again, how's it going?
Oh, hi.
What do you feel like singing, Bob?
Hello?
Charlotte, who?
Hans was very attentive to you.
Oh, for her show?
I just don't know what I'm supposed to be. I thought maybe I wanted to be a writer... but I hate what I write, and I tried taking pictures, but John's so good at that, and mine are so mediocre... and every girl goes through a photography phase, like horses, you know dumb pictures of your feet...
Did that help? Did you learn anything?
Oh.
You are.
Why do you have to be with your opposite, why cant similar people be together?
It's for my daughter.
You can't get sushi anywhere in Japan after 2 o'clock. Did you know that?
I'm sorry.
When are you leaving?
I'm going to miss you.
Why are you crying?
Mr. Kazuzo sent me.
Lydia?
He was this fashion guy, and there were all these Japanese fashion people- it's a whole other world, and I was talking to these Japanese surfers... He was playing all this great music- I have to find out what it was...
Hi, Lydia.
Hello?
I guess she's busy.
When are you coming home?
Hospital?
Hello? Yes?
Evelyn Waugh?
Its just a pseudonym, it doesn't matter.
How'd it go today?
I gotta go meet Kelly for a drink downstairs. She wants to talk about some photo thing.
You smell weird.
Like popcorn?
Do you think it's done?
Its bad for you.
Are you sure you want to stay?
Oh, wait, can you hold on one sec?
It's amazing  there!
Did she waltz in or fly on little bat wings?
I'm gonna have to get a restraining order.  What a nightmare.
Honey, you're exhausted.  Do you want to lie down for a little while?
...you wearing a watch, Father?
You know, I made a reservation at Marco's for Peter's birthday dinner, but maybe you should cater it.
Quiet.  Real quiet...
He asked to go home early.  He said he was bothered by all the people who kept telling him what to do.
So you don't believe his condition is the result of anything supernatural?
Dr. Allen, could you please tell Mr. Kelson what you heard as you tried to enter Mr. Birdson's room?
I've had it.  Townsend's dead.  The police are calling and now I see you having a scene in front of the children. I'm sorry, Maya, you've been with us for many years, but effective immediately, I'm rescinding your right to live at the church.
How're you doing?  Looking lovely as always.
Between your book sales and this TV thing, there's going to be no living with you.  And let me guess, you boiled God down to a conceit.
You fucking bastard.
Father!  Thank God you're better!  I really need your help.  We've only got a few more hours.
We won because Christ...triumphed over Satan?
So, if Christ won, that means, what does that mean, Father?  That Satan...
I took one of those home pregnancy tests, but I don't want to tell him. I'm RH negative.  My blood type is negative...  If he's RH positive, I'll have to terminate.
Oh my God!
I do.
I'll bet.
You're sure?  There was nothing?
I don't understand what's going on.
Peter, let go of the chair!
Good seeing you again.
I've dealt with these people before, Maya.  They're not going to help us.
You do know, don't you.  That these are also numbers.  Greek numbers, 600, 60 and 6 - or 666.  The sign of the Devil.
Peter, you're now writing a book about the Viznick case.  You seem to be making a career of studying sensational murderers.  I have to ask, how does it make you feel when you sit in courtrooms day after day, face to face with alleged killers?
Hey!  Mr. big shot.
Thanks for handling this.
Parents died?
What happened?
Ah, Mom.
You really should be a caterer or something like you used to say.
What?
I asked but why does it always have to be so damn prissy.
So that's why we can't get along? Because I'd rather shoot a "dumb" jump shot?
I remember when I was eight years old, you spent like four hours cooking up this fancy meal.  All you'd let me and Lena do was set the table.  And I guess you and Dad got your wires crossed or something because he walks in with a couple of pizzas.  And you didn't say anything. You just threw the whole meal into some tupper-ware and tossed it in the fridge.
I do.  You never stood up for yourself. Ever.  If I was ashamed, it was because of that.
That's all you cared about.  I must have played in a thousand games and I can only remember you being to two.
She needs to stop running around like a little boy.
We've got our final games against Oregon and Oregon State and I want to shake things up a bit, so I'm starting you at point again.
I'm an English major.  You like English?
My mouth is kinda dry.
Hello.
Nah.
You might be the only one with a job.
Sometimes I wonder if it's worth it. Busting my ass, for what?
That too tight?
I found you someone.
This brother from my college.
I told him you looked like me.
You ever been in love?
The coach from Tennessee was there and he has me riding the bench.
You only have one game left and you haven't been recruited.  Munchkin, I wanted it as bad as you did, but we have to face reality.
Hey, munchkin.
Thanks, Sidra.
You were trying to make me look bad.
But?
Thanks.
Yeah, four years ago.  They had me staying in this tiny-ass town with like fifty people.  I'm not playing, there was about a thousand goats running around, and it gets dark at four o'clock.  Then the whack club I'm on loses three games in a row and I get blamed.  So they fire me.
For real?
Your Dad play?
What do I have to do?
How bout Twinkies?  My mom won't ever buy them.
I think we gotta kiss now.
What's that?
So she's honest.
So who you going to the dance with, Spalding?
I mean it, give it your best shot, cause I'm tired of you holding that over my head.
Please, you jump in some guy's face, talk smack and you get a pat on your ass.  But because I'm a female, I get told to calm down and act like a "lady".  I'm a ballplayer, okay.  A ball player.
Hey.
Four.
Then prove her wrong.
That was so weak.
What has he been to me?  I mean, he looked me in my face and lied like it was nothing.  Like it was easy.  And I'm standing there getting loud on my mom like she's the one with no sense...
Nah.  Don't sweat it.
Hey.
Oh, Kerry, this is Monica.  Monica, Kerry.
Least you got your priorities straight.
How are you going to tell me what I have time for?  I mean, whatever I did...we can fix this.
So that's it, just forget about us?
Alright.  I heard you were in Spain.
Just something I'm trying.
So, how's pro-ball, Europe?
Funny.  I never did.
Actually, I don't...
Yeah.  Basketball just, isn't fun anymore.  You know?
Yeah, and Quincy, good luck with your knee, and everything.
So...how's the knee?
It just isn't.
You had a rough couple years, that's all.
You're serious.
Like what?
So why'd you give up ball?
What's going on?
You haven't changed.  You still think the sun rises and sets on your ass.  Well, guess what, it doesn't.
So?
Hey, girl.
Zeke.
We should head over.
With who?
You just got back from a four game road trip.
I'm not gonna get anywhere punching a clock just so my wife doesn't get an attitude.
You said you'd think about going back to get your degree.
Almost didn't recognize you with your hair like that.  How you been?
What?
I'm not playing with you, these girls are looking to get you caught.  They see you, they see dollar signs.
Still the man.
Whose truth are you talking about?
Just...leave it alone.
Boy, what'd I tell you about using that word?
What people?
So what are you gonna do?
Why?
What's Mom think?
What are you doing here?
Lucky kid.
After five years.
Look, I'm busy.
You smell like trouble --
C'mon, Jimmy, snap up, snap up --
Call 911. Call 911 right now.
Jimmy you look like you're about to fuckin' die right here --
It was scary though.
...what the fuck is this...?
Yeah, yeah right -- what the fuck are doing?  WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING IN MY HOUSE?
...yeah...
For what?
Yeah.
No.
What are you lookin' for?
Yeah.
Yeah.
You take cream or sugar?
Yeah.
The gentleman who came to the door --
It's where situations like these lead, Claudia, unless you do something about it early, if and when the police call and come for help.  Now there are certain measures you can take --
I'm gonna run to the bathroom real quick.
Ok, ok. I'm back.
I'm sorry, Claudia.
No, no.  I was wondering...man oh man. I think I feel like a bit of a scum-bucket doing this, considering that I came here as an officer of the law and the situation and all this but I think I'd be a fool if I didn't do something I really want to do which is to ask you on a date.
I don't know.  I haven't thought about it -- you know what -- that's not true -- I have thought about it.  I've thought about going on a date with you since you opened the door.
Eight o'clock?
Great, bye.
Why not?
You wanna make a deal with me?
I'm gonna run to the bathroom for a minute...maybe just --
I haven't been on a date since I was married and that was three years ago....and Claudia...whatever you wanna tell me, whatever you think might scare me, won't...and I will listen...I will be a good listener to you if that's what you want...and you know, you know...I won't judge you.... I can do that sometimes, I know, but I won't...I can...listen to you and you shouldn't be scared of scaring me off or anything that you might think I'll think or on and on and just say it and I'll listen to you....
It's ok.
I'll take everything at face value. I'll be a good listener to you.
Say what you want and you'll see --
-- you the resident here?
-- can I get you?
-- what kind?
I'm fine. Yes. I'm fine.
LET'S GO, LET'S GO, LET'S GET HIS MONEY AND GO -- DID YOU GET HIS MONEY? DID YOU GET IT?  DID YOU GET HIS MONEY, DAD?
Put me on the payroll, find out, find out wassup --
Have you ever been to Juvenille Hall?
Check that ego - come off it - I'm the profit - the proffesor Ima teach you 'bout The Worm, who eventually turned to catch wreck with the neck of a long time oppressor And he's runnin from the devil, but the debt is always gaining And if he's worth being hurt, he's worth bringin' pain in - When the sunshine don't work, the Good Lord bring the rain in.
Did you listen to me?
I have to talk to Frank, is he nearby?
Phil, hang in just one more minute ok?  I'm gonna put you on hold -- Doc you still there?
-- the kind of love that makes you feel that intagible joy.  Pit of your stomach. Like a bucket of acid and nerves running around and making you hurt and happy and all over you're head over heels....?
You talk in rhymes and riddles and ra...rub-adub --- but that doesn't mean anything to me, see....see...see I used to be smart....I'm Quiz Kid Donnie Smith. I'm Quiz Kid Donnie Smith from the tv --
Things go round 'n round, don't they?
I'm sick.
Brad, I know you don't love me now --
I lent my name, my celebrity. Exactly --
I don't know.
-- you don't understand: it's more pain than before and the fucking morphine pills aren't working, he's -- past two days it's like he can't really swallow them and I don't know if they're going down -- I can't see inside his mouth anymore -- I'm up all night staring at him and I don't think the pills are going down and he moans and he hurts --
I need to sit down.
And do good things with her...share the thing...all that bullshit is true, y'know...find someone and hold on all that...Where's Linda?
...cocksucker....
Do me a personal favor --
She's my love...my life...love of it... In school when you're 12 years old. In school, in six grade....and I saw her and I didn't go to that school...but we met. And my friend knew her...I would say, "What's that girl?"  "How's that Lily?" "Oh, she's a bad girl...she sleeps with guys..."  My friend would say this....but then sometime...I went to another school, you see? But then...when high school at the end, what's that?  What is that?  When you get to the end?
Hello?
That's fine.  It's nice to meet you.
-- just to clarify --
Well, just trying to figure out who you are, and how you might have become --
She lived in Tarzana.
No, this is about getting something right and claryfying one of your answers to an earlier question --
Yeah.
Where are you from originally?
And what did your parents do?
I'm sorry.
Psychology major?
Do you have your masters?
It's not your given name, right?
Kind of.
How long have you taken care of him?
.....have you ever seen this..I mean, never mind, you said --
I've heard your tapes on the phone.
What? What? What now?
I am calm.
There's no disturbance.
I AM CALM.
I live alone.
I preffer to stand.
I didn't do anything.
Yes I can, Marcie.  And until you start givin' me some straight answers: I'm gonna assume that some mischief has been goin' on here.
Been drinkin' today?
What the hell is this Marcie?
Are you gonna tell her what you've done?
I can't fuckin' do this.
Did you tell her?
I don't think I want that.
No.  No.
Jimmy, did you touch her?
Yes you do.
She's asleep.
Commercials, a sitcom, an MOW or something.
They look pretty smart, I think.
You don't want any water?
Linda, you're safe.  Ok. It's alright. You're my friend.  You and Earl are my clients and what you need to talk about won't leave this room, you have something you have to say --
I don't want him to die, I didn't love him when we met, and I've done so many bad things to him that he doesn't know, things I want to confess to him, but now I do: I love him. I love him so much and I can't stand -- he's going.
I've got Frank...Frank Earl's son. He's...he asked me to get him and I did --
You don't do that, you don't call him, you don't know to get involved in the bussiness of his, of his of <u>my</u> family. this is the <u>family</u>, <u>me</u> and <u>him</u> do you understand?  You understand? NO ONE ELSE. THERE IS NO ONE ELSE.  That man, his son does not exist.  HE IS DEAD.  HE IS DEAD and WHO TOLD YOU TO DO THAT?
Cats and Dogs out there, huh?
What would you like?
Mmm.Hmmm.
Ok.
Total is $15.29.  Thirty minutes or less.
The fuck is wrong with you?
Did you piss your fuckin' pants, Stanley?
I don't wanna go, I can't do it this time.
C'mon, man.
You ready to keep winning?
I didn't I'm fine, I'm fine.
Hi.
..sorry...
...what...?
I am preparing for a ball!
D'Artagnan, arrest them all!
What do you propose to do?
Prison was horrible but it was his home.  He's been torn from it by strangers.  He's frightened, exhausted -- and the mask is familiar.  Let him rest in it tonight, and remove it tomorrow.
Then you are a fool -- a fool who has never lost a son.  What gives you the right to judge me, to play God with the lives of others?  Is it because you are so much holier than everyone else?!
Three days.
Remember, Phillippe... nobility is born in the heart.
Then to the Bastille.
Pull them back, d'Artagnan.
I observe your forgiveness isn't sweeter than a plump nipple.
Mother of God!
I don't understand.  What does this have to do with...?  You carried a baby somewhere, it's unusual, but --
Coming?
We go someplace dangerous.
Let's see you rob somebody with your pistol there!
But what if something extraordinary happened?  Something so unusual that all the attention went to someone else?  Someone whose confirmation of Phillippe the King would never be questioned.
I care only about Michelle.  Should I ask her when we first arrive? Or... or when we're leaving?  I could ask her in the carriage -- but it is more romantic at the palace. I get so confused...
But -- are you sure?
Die?  What...?
Thanks, but not for me.
This cannot be.  Everyone knows the Queen Mother is a recluse, and the ladies-in-waiting are but mistresses for the king!
It is honor you serve, and when the king is dishonorable you are removed from your oath of honor!
He lies.  He is here to trap us.
Recent hours have been a shock.
What is that?
This place... I once lived in a country house.  I had guardians -- an old man and woman.  And tutors. But no friends.  Then when I was twelve, they came and took me to the prison.
Then you must allow me to stay close to you so that --
I just left the garden, it was empty.  What did you see?
Your Majesty.  This ball, with an open invitation to the nobility of Paris -- we have no way of checking --
Wait.  Bargain me to Louis, for all your lives.  You have done your best.  Let me go, and let all of you find peace.
What number, on the first page?
Did they kill him?
Cowards!  Twenty run from four?!
Sire!  I -- How did you --
From Raoul.  He urges you to guard your honor -- as if it could be in any danger... from your king.
Raoul... Oh, Raoul...
Captain Doyle?
We did a little digging on Jim Trudell at Sergeant Zydowski's request. He's 31, no priors, and he's been working for the military for ten years.
Alright, we know who we're looking for.  Play it cool until the time is right to make a move.  Let's not pull any gangbusters shit or we'll lose him again.
So what is they have enough to shut us down!
Did you hit him?
I'll take the south end -
What?
It's kind of a funny coincidence, isn't it?
Anyhow...	you wake up and she's gone. But--  --this is my favorite part--  she leaves you the keys to a brand new Beemer.
Yeah...the guy was psycho - I was just tying to protect the girl...
I was just having a little fun -
What?  Wait a minute -
Did you read today's paper?
Speak of the devil.
Didn't these - professionals - figure he had a girl in the room?
And what did you do?
I had it all on tape...
There's something I've been meaning to ask you, Stephanie.
And?...
You gotta turn yourself in. Before it's too late -
I hope you haven't lost your touch with this stuff.
OK, I'm logged on to the municipal network.  I'm showing sixteen people with the name Sarah Williams in L.A. county.  None of them live in Hollywood.  Do you remember the address?
I don't, but I'm pretty sure. It's a long story but I cloned a cellular linkup with a binary code scrambler and sent it through the phone network mainframe.  If they start a trace it will be to a Pic'n'Save on Pico.
OK...Marvosa makes calls to this fax number overseas.  And that's Switzerland's country code.
Where are you going?
What?
Don't you guys ever knock?
Long gone, huh?
It was you who did the asking.
No.  The numbers aren't right for a jailhouse alphabet code. It's a book code.  And your message has to go out in it, or he'll know it's not Lecktor talking to him.
Where?
Whatever I say, you'll take him away, won't you?
How much do you know?
Eighty-six so far. All cranks. He smashes the mirrors and uses the pieces.  None of them knew that;
Will... you saw this in the papers. The second one was all over TV. Did you ever think about givin' me a call?
Why not?
You look all right now.
...snuck in the hospital while I was sedated, flipped back the sheets and shot pictures. The only decent thing he did was run a black square over my balls...
When are you coming back?
It's a word. Killing them...  His delusion is: if he sees himself accepted enough times, he will become as one who has the power to be accepted all the time.  And he would record it somehow. So he can see himself received over and over again...
That's why the boltcutter.
It's the guard in the storeroom.
There's somebody in the house, Jack...
Not yet.
...twenty-eight minutes.  Cryptography at Langley?
What's being photographed?
Ride with me.
Come on in.  How about a gin and tonic?
That was nice of you to think of that.
My sister's coming by to pick me up for brunch. Why don't you come, too?
The developing room.  I need to... see you.
Who is it?
Are you cold? Would you like a blanket?
Do you see?
Mrs. Jacobi after her changing.  The Dragon rampant. Do you see?
Freddie Lounds. Your photograph. Do you see?
'No' what?
Linda King's desk.
Okay.
Do you know something about that?
Talk to them a few minutes and you can tell they don't have the capacity to even understand what's going on. Do you?
Let's get straight who we've talking about.  Are you the man I'm interested in?
I don't want to do that,
'Intimate? !"
He may have a history of biting -- barroom fights or child abuse.
The Commissioner was saying you were the one that caught Dr. Lecktor three years ago.  He killed nine people, didn't he?
What did the psychologists say was wrong with Lecktor?
To yourself...
It's at the vet's. The kids brought it in with a puncture wound in the abdomen. icepick or an awl.
No.
Molly?
You remember when we first met?  And were together alone in that room. And the exhilaration was too much to hold on to. And then something flickered across your face like a shadow and I asked you what was wrong?
Then why?
What will you do?
Is Crawford going with you?
It's Will Graham. Is Molly there, Mr. Swenson?
Yes. Is Molly there?
I know... 'Out in the good air...'
That's right.
What do you want?
Crabs would get most of the newborns before they made it to the sea, huh?
Is there anything I need to know to see about Mom?
How did it happen?
What kind of coffee do you like?
Did you get my card?
A layman..., layman. Interesting term. So many experts on government grants. And you say you're a 'layman?' But it was you who caught me, wasn't it, Will? Do you know how you did it'
In the papers. I don't tear out the articles.  I wouldn't want them to think I was dwelling on anything morbid. You want to know how he's choosing them, don't you?
Because, my dear Will, if this Pilgrim imagines he has a relationship with the full moon, he might go outside and look at it.  Have you seen blood in moonlight, Will? It appears quite black. If one were nude, it would be better to have outdoor privacy for this sort of thing.
It's not 'interesting'. You thought of it before.
No.
I'm gonna spray your suit jackets. It'll be invisible in this light, but you'll stand out like a zebra for us.  They told me you checked out a .44 Charter Arms Bulldog.
Because he's gone for the head shot seven out of eight times'
Hey, I really enjoyed your set.
I'm -- Fonzie? GEORGE NO!  The Fonzie!  The crazy breakout character!  The guy that all the kids impersonate and put on their lunchboxes!
Are you makin' fun of me --?  This is RIDICULOUS!
Look, I'm sorry.  They're assholes! But we work in a creative business. You can't predict what people are gonna like --
I'm sorry, George...
No, it's true.  I have lung cancer.
Tony Clifton.
I can't move my arm.
Really?
But I've got a sports show. Championship wrestling, at five.
B-but I have them.
Five.
Excuse me -- ?
Why did you call me?  The last person I ever expected to get a call from was you.
Oh!  Uh, I hope I didn't offend you.
Do you wanna to go to Memphis and get married?
Go away.
Andy, you're not horrible.  You're just... complicated.
Have you told your family?
How can you be so casual??!
I'm not comfortable with the last sketch.  I DON'T do drug humor!
T-there wasn't a reason to purposely hurt me --
My father said I should've gotten a lawyer --!
I dunno about this...  What will my mother think?
Hey -- that stuff gets written-up in the papers --
I was very original!
Well, call SAG.  It'd be cool to get one on the show.  I want the evening to build and build.  It's gonna have the most incredible ending: Singers, dancers, the "Hallelujah Chorus" -- then the sky opens, and Santa Claus comes flying down!
Look -- I gotta be clear with you. Tony Clifton is NOT Andy Kaufman.
Yeah, I KNOW what I said!  But -- trust me, it's not gonna happen!
"Burlesque"?
Who is this? TONY CLIFTON  You -- you know damn straight who it is.  Tony Clifton!  A name to respect.  A name to fear.  Beer.  Gear.  Deer.  Ear.
That was a really hot house!
So you've got this big elaborate joke, which is really only funny to two people in the universe.  You... and you.
Why...?  Andy, why...?
It's a perfect Kaufman audience.
Is he in his room?
Hmph!  They sure didn't give Andy much to do.
Why is he saying these things?!
He'll be contacting us again.
The great Morpheus.  We meet at last.
Lieutenant?
I sent two units.  They're bringing her down now.
He's gonna make it.
Weird.
Who is it?
Something wrong, man?  You look a little whiter than usual.
You ever have the feeling that you're not sure if you're awake or still dreaming?
Don't be ridiculous.
Hello, Trinity.
You are a beautiful woman.  Too bad things had to work out like this.
But you're out, Cypher.  You can't go back.
Whoa!  Shit, Neo, you scared the Bejeezus out of me.
Is that...?
Do you always look at it encoded?
Why you're here?
There was an accident.  A fucking car accident.  All of a sudden. Boom.  Jesus, someone's going to make a believer out of me.
I got a fibrillation!
What is he doing?
Right now?
Holy fucking shit!
No way, no way, this is crazy.
They got to you first, but they've underestimated how important you are.  If they knew what I know, you would probably be dead.
Why not?
The Matrix is everywhere, it's all around us, here even in this room. You can see it out your window or on your television.  You feel it when you go to work, or go to church or pay your taxes.  It is the world that has been pulled over your eyes to blind you from the truth.
Have you ever had a dream, Neo, that you were so sure was real?
... am I dead?
Why do my eyes hurt?
Get some rest.  You're going to need it.
How did I beat you?
I know what you're trying to do --
I thought it wasn't real.
If you are killed in the Matrix, you die here?
This is another Matrix simulation. A training program to help you get your sea legs and teach you one very important lesson.
The beginning?
And she's never wrong.
Morpheus, I don't think this is a good idea.
Got it.
Tank.
Tank, charge the E.M.P.
I'm going to make the call.
So?  What do you think?  You think you're the One?
Sorry, kid.  You got the gift but looks like you're waiting for something.
Hello, Neo.
What?
How did you do that?
Of what?
Are you all right?
No, you're not.
Morning.  Did you sleep?
See who?
When it does, Morpheus will tell them anything they want to know.
Which way?  Which way?
We need an exit!
Tank, you're hurt.
Operator.
Neo!
They've burned through the outer shields.
Great...great...listen, I'm very interested in you guys because I'll be opening a new club myself soon... uptown...and maybe we can work something out...
Whether she wants to or not...she's not going.
No, all we got is $40.
Riverdale.
Keep quiet about this.  I don't have any license for him yet.  I've only had him a couple of days. Nobody can feed him except me.  I'm the only one he trusts.  Watch.
Really wanted to get a little tiger Charlie, y'know...a little William Blake and all that...
See what I mean?  A question please...'Is this what you call living?'
And I wouldn't call it TONY'S PLACE or CHARLIE'S PLACE...  I'd call it something like SEASON OF THE WITCH... get it?
May God be with you.
'My kingdom is not of this world. If my kingdom were of this world my followers would have fought that I might not be delivered to the Jews. But, as it is my kingdom is not from here.'
Prophesy to us, oh Christ!  Who is it that struck thee?
Where to?
Nervous?
It'll be OK - I know those guys. They won't stiff you.
Drinks for everybody Tony...
Let's get out of here.
Charlie, you know the best way to take care of this whole mess.
If you had a little talk with your uncle...if anybody can do it, he can.
Your cousin here was getting sick, worrying about you.  We've been in here calling...
Oh, cut it out, will ya?
No...I'll be ok for a week.
Look, Michael, I'll get him here. What do you want me to do, kill him?
Where's the rest?
You're really crazy.
You know Diane...I've been wanting to talk to you for a while now...er... a...  aside from all that joking around we do out there...when you're on...I... a...I really...think that you're a terrific performer...
Well, maybe you missed something?
Why don't you take a look around the place if you want?
Sure...it's not that...I mean...
See if you can get your hands on some pamphlets on laws or by laws...or proprietorship...you know...at your place.
You know...like restaurants, night clubs...
It doesn't make any sense.  He wouldn't shoot him just because he insulted a racket guy...not unless it was personal.
Yeah...but don't worry about that now.  The Hemmingway one is first.
Take your time.  I don't care.
The building on the corner.  That one!  He's been on the roof a half hour now!
Teresa?...Yeah, Charlie.  Listen, I'm looking for your cousin.  Yeah, well today's Tuesday, payday.  I haven't seen him all day...no...well, have you got any idea where he is?  I know it's early yet but I'm just getting worried that's all...
Put it on the little tab so that it balances with the big one.
Hey... you got stereo.
You mean it's heisted.
Just keep him quiet.
Must have been all the liquor in him.
That's your name?
Look who's talking.
His wife?
Whatever it was, they'll be here. We sent out invitations to everyone, plane tickets included -- the RSVP's are amazing.  A few of them we didn't hear from, and some of them are dead, of course --
I do it because I love you.  Because everybody I loved you.  Mommy -- wher- ever she is -- Susan, Quince, the people who work for you, everybody who's ever known you.
Honey --!
Thank you for coming.
We're not getting anywhere here. Why don't we take some of the best out of this thing, let's consider it coolly, let's take a week --
May I interrupting?
No.
No, I don't --
Good morning, Drew.  Thanks for coming out.
Why yes, Bill, I was saying to Quince --
It's going to be great --
So... Board convenes tomorrow, you'll recommend, we close and it's a deal, right?
Sorry...um - you - you know it's gone right out of my head --
You're not familiar with the phrase, "In this world, nothing is certain but Death and Taxes"?
Why?
I have to go, Bill -- it's been a helluva day.  Need a few minutes to sort everything out.
Yes, you are to understand that, and now may I ask you a question?
In English, please.
And what do I get?
Hey, this is it, the hour approach- es, I'm getting all excited.  So what do you think, is it --  -- just the 'Executive Committee' or could you guys use me?
Never mind Bontecou.  I've got some other merger possibilities up my sleeve, and I'm putting them to see old man.
We'll do it together.  I'll clue you in.  Timing's got to be right.  The old man says it's up to Joe.
I don't want to get rich this way -- I'm going to expose you.
Obeah.
My Doctor Lady?
She knows how she feel.
Don' need you okayin'.
Brung you flowers and all I gettin's facety back.
The Board is waiting.
That's very gracious of you, Quince.
You're an original, Joe.  A little hard to figure, maybe...
C'mon, have a drink.  You look like you need one bad as me.
'Love'?  Oh, man, I've got troubles of my own.
Oh yes, you are one of my favorites.
-- Can't seem to escape you today.
Come again?
No, Joe, I'm swimming here.  Then I'm going home.
Goodnight, Joe.
I have to go, I'm sorry to say --
I appreciate you --
Why?
Almost.
I like you in a black tie.
But there's so much to tell you --
I'm still here.
You think so?
Joe, that's the kitchen.
I wish you had said something to me about staying here --
How long have I got?
Sounds fair enough.
I'm not everybody.
What I'm trying to say is this is a Board meeting and you are not a mem- ber of the Board.
Yes, I am.  There's a research lib- rary on the fourth floor.  Why don't you go down and read some magazines?
Jennifer, give Mr. Black a map of the city.
And more.
Okay.  Goodnight.
I'm sorry, Bill --
I couldn't sleep.
So that's what love is?
Those were my words, Bill.
Susan wants to come.  She says she's in love with me.
I told you to shut up.
Happy Birthday, Bill.
You want me to be your guide --?
When I introduce you, if I say who you are, I don't think anyone will stay for dinner.
The great Bill Parrish at a loss for words?  The man from whose lips fall 'rapture' and 'passion' and 'obses- sion'...all those admonitions about being 'deliberately happy', what there is no sense 'living your life without...', all the sparks and energy you give off, the rosy advice you dispense in round, pear-shaped tones --
The 'question' --
...what can I say after I say that I'm sorry?  I zipped when I should've zagged, I opened my big mouth one too many times, everything got all twisted --
Come in, Joe -- I want to thank you -- okay, Bill?
Why don't we let it rest for the moment?  Give it some air?
...It's not over, 'til it's over.
Eddie, hold out all the hope you want but, I promise you, it's hope- less, it's over.  Come on up, let's get drunk, if I had your shoulder to lean on I might actually enjoy this --
Good morning, Dad.
I hope so.
Susan, you're a hell of a woman. You've got a great career, you're beautiful --
Well, I wasn't going to say that --
You're terrible.
Are you okay?
Do you mind if I raise a little caution flag?
You were right about Joe, he is going somewhere --
But what?
Good morning, I was talking kind of loud there, sorry.
Oh yeah?  What was 'fascinating' about it?
I'm not trying to sharpshoot you, but that 'nothing lasts' stuff, that's what was the trouble with Honey's guy.  He was fooling around and Honey caught him at it.  One girlfriend wasn't enough for him.
Yes, I could.  I have an office in the hospital.
You'll have a hard time finding a woman like that these days --
No, it was so right it scares me.
Why?
39.
66.
Should I wear it?
What can I do for you, Leonard?
My wife.
This isn't your room. You're in 304. I Fucked up.
No, let's go.
Last week. Then I rented you another one On top of this.
And he says you're gonna wanna hear what he's got to say.							   *
I like your car.
I just want you to tell me how you came by that car.
Do you remember me?
You think you can bargain with me?!
You don't remember me.
* So I'll take a picture, get a tattoo.			  * 							   * The world doesn't disappear when you			   * close your eyes, does it? My actions			   * still have meaning, even if I can't			    * remember them. My wife deserves				   * vengeance, and it doesn't make any				* difference whether I know about it.			    *
I wrote an address in there, too. Might be useful. It's this abandoned place outside of town. I guy I know used to use it for his bigger deals.
It's isolated.
Guess I don't have to worry about him anymore.
Calm down. You're not into anything. It was my problem, you offered no help. It's got nothing to do with your investigation.
Something feels wrong. I think someone's fucking with me. Trying to get me to kill the wrong guy.
What?
Me? Why would he be interested in me?
What's wrong?
Neither do I.
What?
Don't say another fucking word!
* Depends on if he's here in town. Or if he's moved on. See, I've got all this -			*
I'm meeting someone called Natalie.
I don't know. I'm sorry.
Mrs. Jankis, what do you want from me?
Yeah, but the pleasure of a book is in wanting to know what happens next -
Beg my forgiveness! Beg my wife's forgiveness before I blow your brains out!
This is your car.
What the hell you want to go there for?
Yeah, it's just this fucked-up building.		    * Why are we going there?
Unfinished business. What made you think I wasn't coming back?
You're living.
Why are you here?
Fuck you. We shoulda taken his car.
Unfinished business.
Why?
Envelopes?							    *
How do you know this?
I don't know. See, I have this condition.
Like you've told yourself. Over and over. Conditioning yourself to believe. "learning through repetition" -
I was wrong! That's the whole point! Sammy's wife came to me and -
You know, when we found your guy and			   * killed him.  That's right, the real John G. Over a			  * year ago. I helped you find him. He's			  * already dead.							 *
So who are you saying he was?					*
I should kill you.							 *
It is now.
What cop?
Gin and Tonic.  Plymouth or Boodles.
Oh, yeah...
Make it 40%.
I thought we had to meet the Man.
What do you like to drink?
How fast does that go?
The Keys?
I insist.
'Cause you don't lose loads?
The range should be between fifteen and seventeen-point-five percent of the P.O.E....to even consider it.
...to fall back on.  You know, a fail-safe.  Insurance.
Is this the protective male talk?
Yero, by himself?
What are you going to do with me? Are you taking me to jail?  You think I will turn into your informant, is that it?
You afraid of violence?
Client got delivery.  But there were..."extras" in the back of the truck.
Yeah?
What's our deal?
And there's Dmitri...
Aryan brothers are not going to change-up suppliers.  So...
You're not makin' a move on her...?
I am asking.  You to me.
Eleven to seven he blows it.
Go ahead.
Detective Crockett.
4-4-7 Charlie 12-92.
Guy's involved in a "meet"...
OMGs, Mongols, Nazi Low-Riders, prison gangs?
Out of...?
"Hi, Gina.  Hi, Sonny."
You're so <u>not</u> the PD, if you got busted on a DUI, you're in serious trouble...you're bad men back to grammar school.  San Quentin.  Pelican Bay.  Marine Corps.  Statesville. Pelican Bay, where you guys hooked up.  Now you're too smart and too fast to get jacked again...
Correct.  Flash samples.  Flash cash.
As in, your ass is dead in the water.
What am I supposed to do after I get my nails and hair done...?
And...?
Why?
And as an investment in the future...
It's all bullshit.  Jesus is out of communication in Fals de Iguazu. Jos knows that...  Whatever he's going to do, he has to do it fast because he's acting on his own. And he will need a story.
What the hell did you do?
Don't know what line Morey's in, but myself now, fact is -- I'm a hustler.
Yeah?
Ain't gonna collect your pay?
Were you looking? About the Statue of Liberty?
... you see what I'm getting at here? She got a penthouse up there with color TV and more goddam diamonds than an archbishop and she busts out bawling when I ask for money!
Oh hell, forget it.
What's in your socks?
You keep the sixty-four cents. I want you to have it.
What for?
Joe -- do me one favor -- this is my place, am I wrong? You know, in my own place my name ain't Ratso. I mean it so happens my name is Enrico Salvatore Rizzo.
You ain't got a chance in hell. You need threads and glitter, baby. A front, hey?
Hey, you're good! I bet you could pick up a living at this if you tried.
Well, I don't think I can walk.  I mean, I been falling down a lot and, uh...
Well, just exactly what the hell you think you're gonna do? Die on me?
These guys're good drivers.
You get your first palm tree in South Carolina.
You're what?
Hell, don't cry about it!
Here. Don't even thank me.
Am I tickled to find you, boy! Come on in and let's get a look at you. Turn around. Good strong back. You'll need it. So you want help -- take a seat, relax, tell me about yourself. Cowboy, huh?
Take it,easy, boy...  Seems to me you're different than a lotta boys that come to me. Most of 'em seem troubled, confused, but I'd say you knew exactly what you want.
Lonesomeness is something you take. You bear? Dammit, you take it and go about your business, that's all.
Ready for hard work, son?
Who?
Gotta be here someplace.  Thought I heard a couple of dead Christians singing down there.
How do you like it?  Istanbul?
Those mountains? are they?
No!  I'm not going any further! It'll wreck my car.
Where are the minefields?
You decided to fly at a bad time Billy Palestinian Guerrillas all over the place blowing up planes and all.
Four planes in four days...but I guess you kids don't read the newspapers...and what with our people kicking up a shit storm 'bout the flow of heroin from Turkey you got...
Well, you see Billy, it don't really matter right now if it's 2 kilos or 200 kilos. The Turks love to catch any foreigner smuggling - it shows the world they're fighting the drug trade.
...are you with the Consulate?
And you?
You gotta be fucking crazy!  You got stabbed in the ass once too much, sweetheart, cause you're gonna end up in Section 13, that's what - not the 'catacombs.
Okay?
What?
It's already been cut.
Just got some news on Bell.
Bad. Sent to the City Hospital. They ruptured his hernia again.
The blintzes!  "Try the blintzes..."
Did they get the sleazebag who owns this place?
Funny.  Shoulda seen some track bunnies by now.
Show that to the station manager.  Tell him Leonard's gonna have his bubble-butt he don't have someone down here in ten.
Look, I showed you my badge...
For Chrissakes.  You gonna lay a two- bit bureaucratic, territorial number on me?
Any luck?
Its muscles are locked.
A mistake.
What do you-?
My God, what the hell are you...?
What are you doing down here?
What's Manny doing? I can't see him anymore.
What are you putting that crap on me for?
He didn't do it!
Which way?
A shame.  You looked great tonight.
Metaxonycha Godmani.
Ironic, don't you think?  These guys can hatch hundreds of offspring in a single clutch of eggs, right? And here we are...
...you don't even know what you're looking for.
Why take the chance?  Just let me go down there with you...
C'mon...
You guys have done a nice job.  How bout five dollars?
Sure.
Here.
Shouldn't I be in a hospital?
Don't move now--wouldn't want to hurt this neck--  Well, the other afternoon I was on my way home, and there you were, leaving the Lodge, and I wondered why a literary genius would go for a drive when there was a big storm coming.
When do you think the phone lines'll be back up? I have to call my daughter, and I should call New York and let my agent know I'm breathing.
You want to read it?
I have a hard and fast rule about who can read my stuff at this early stage--only my editor, my agent, and anyone who saves me from freezing to death in a car wreck.
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to wake you.
But this time I thought clearly. I asked God about you and God said "I delivered him unto you so that you may show him the way."
You want me to burn my book?
I know this is the only copy, Paul. When you were twenty-four you wrote your first book and you didn't make a copy, because you didn't think anybody would take it seriously. But they did. And ever since you've never made any copies because you're superstitious--it's why you always come back to the Silver Creek Lodge. You told that story to Merv Griffin eleven years ago.
Yeah, well, it's a theory. Here's your Novril.  How does tuna casserole sound for dinner?
You--fooler...!  Did I do good?
But mine cost the most so I don't see how it could smudge.
Well, it does smudge after all--isn't that fascinating?
Paul, what you've written just isn't fair.
Don't be silly. Of course you can.
Oh, Paul, can I read each chapter when you finish? I can fill in the "n"s.  Will she be her old self, now that Ian has dug her out, or will she have amnesia...?
Misery's alive! Misery's alive. Oh, it's so romantic--this whole house is going to be filled with romance. I'm going to put on my Liberace records--  --you do like Liberace, don't you?
When you first came here, I only loved the writer part of Paul Sheldon. But now I know I love the rest of him too. As much as Misery loves Ian.  I know you don't love me--don't say you do--you're a beautiful, brilliant, famous man of the world; and I'm...not a movie star type. You'll never know the fear of losing someone like you if you're someone like me.
The book is almost finished. Your legs are getting better. Soon you'll be able to walk. You'll be wanting to leave.
Paul, I know you've been out.
I'll drive a sledgehammer into your man-gland if you're not nicer--
Oh, Paul. It's beautiful.
The stranger staying at the Inn, is he someone from Misery's past?
It WAS Windthorne. I knew it--what does that do to her love for Ian?--  --of course, if she hadn't thought Windthorne was murdered she never would have fallen in love with Ian in the first place.  Sorry, it's just that this is so wonderful.
I was fooling, silly.  You need a cigarette, because you used to smoke but you quit except when you finish a book, and you just have one, and the match is to light it. And you need one glass of champagne.  Dome Pear-igg-non.
Did I do good?
We actually got a phone call. Busy morning.
Here's the list of all Sheldon's credit charges. Nothing after the Silver Creek.  Any calls?
You don't think he's dead, do you?
They're hauling Misery into court.
People sure like those Misery books.
No, no, of course not. It's just that his daughter hasn't heard from him, and when he's got a book coming out, he usually keeps in touch. So when there was no word from him...
Nothing unusual about Mr. Sheldon's leaving, Buster--you can tell by the champagne.
Has she been buying any odd things lately?
An old friend. I was rummaging through a closet and it was just sitting there. Like it was waiting for me.
When I wrote my first book, I used to carry it around in this while I was looking for a publisher. That was a good book, Marcia. I was a writer then.
And my contacts at Time and Newsweek tell me they're both raves. And don't laugh--for the first time, I think you've got a shot at some prizes.
I thought you'd be thrilled. You're being taken seriously.
I like it. Remember how you once said I live my whole life as if I'm in danger of being found out? Well, I believe I've managed to get that guy down on paper.  Don't think I'm completely nuts, but in some way, Annie Wilkes, that whole experience, helped me.
- right -  - don't go too far ahead of me now -
One considers her timing, of course - getting nicked within a week of the plane going down.  Suggestive, even borderline suspicious, but hardly conclusive.
You're not scrutinizing any casual shrug for some hair-splitting nuance, are you?
Where is it?
How grateful?
Magic...
You're not interested in seeing how it looks.
See anything you like?
Sort it all out.
God damn it, Nyah!  Why did you do it?  Why did you save that bastard?
Nyah!
Fight a bit of a cold..
Beats fighting the flu, I'm here to tell you.
I would've thought the hardest part was exercising restraint.  Curbing that pressing need of your to get your gun off.  You were in such a hurry to knock off that 747, you never figured out where the virus really was.
Not exactly.  Wallis?
It is, Billy.
Billy.  I think we got a problem.  Nyah's on the wing.  Up early.  Billy, do you copy?
That's it?  That's it? That's it?
Look, it's either you or the rent and I don't mind telling you it's not an easy choice.
Uh-huh.
Where's the bloody -
Sounds smashing.  I'm in.  Muchacho, mi carro, por favor!  Now be serious.  You couldn't possibly want me off tonight's performance..
You're apologizing for me?  Quite the gentleman..
Awfully short notice..
When they've got your recruiting technique?  Not a thing.
The only other spook I knew was a liar. Charming but absolutely incapable of telling the truth.  He'd lie about his favorite color.  But then I reckon it's an occupational hazard.  All spies really do is conceal the truth and tell lies.
Well, then, what I am I doing here?  I assume I'm meant to be some sort of thief-to catch-a-thief..
Spoken like a spook..you ever afraid?
That's lot of people out there..how many of them, I wonder, are capable of something like that?
Go and insinuate yourself back into Sean's life.
But I don't have a conscience.  I'm a bloody thief.
You don't trust me.
You'll be fine.  I'm going to lose you.
Just like old times?
Have you met them?
Ambrose has photographs of newspapers with loads of money piled on them -- thirty- seven million on the London Times.  What's that about?
Where do I meet you?
Easy, easy, easy, shhh!
Ethan, you know what frightens me most when I'm with him?..the thought of never seeing you..how are we getting out of here?
No.
Sorry I didn't let you know where I was.
Well.  You're sorry and I'm sorry.
So there's one thing we know Ambrose doesn't.
Whatever Nekhorvich was carrying Sean wanted and he wanted to conceal the fact that he took it.
Right now only Ambrose knows that.
'Terrorists?'
She's got no training for this kind of thing.
- good.  Then if you manage to get hold of Ambrose, and obtain what he's got, you've got -  - 8 hours 57 minutes and twenty-three seconds to destroy the largest remaining source of Chimera on earth.
But you were under specific instructions to bring back a living sample of the Chimera virus.  I'd be very interested to know how, after you'd managed its recovery intact, it subsequently got destroyed.
No, I don't.  But in this case -
..not in time to save him.
Nekhorvich specialized in recombining DNA molecules.  In the myth, Bellerophon killed Chimera, a recombinant monster with the head of a lion and the tail of a serpent who plagued the ancient world.  I think Nekhorvich has created a monster virus in Chimera and apparently the means to kill it in Bellerophon.
Luther..get us everything you can on the outbreak of influenza on Bruny Island last month, including photos of the victims.
Nekhorvich's boss?
Left jacket pocket confirmed.
Ambrose got Bellerophon from Nekhorvich on the plane, but he didn't get the Chimera virus.
Now how to get in there.
You asked for my help.  You <u>asked</u> for <u>my</u> help...come on...
Come on!
Maybe we dont have to know what he looks like.  If hes got that list, hes going to want to check it.  We should be looking for laptops.
You knew about Jim?
Two minutes til Krieger shows.  Thisll have to be quicker than Id like. Certainly quicker than youd like.
Well Claire do you?  Have you been exploiting his feelings or returning them?
I don't think you're in any position to give orders, do you?  Not while I'm holding this.
I want to sleep.  Can I sleep here.
Are <u>you</u> all right Ethan.  What's wrong with you?
They're dead.  Jim's dead.
What are you going to do?
We've got seventy-five rounds for your Glock 9, but only twenty for the Sig Sauer, one pair of Visco glasses with monitor, plenty of passports. You said it yourself -- if I'm not dead, I'm with you.
It's cash. And a second passport. If anything goes wrong when we're inside, if you sense even the slightest deviation don't look over your shoulder, you walk away - you hear me? Just walk away.
I didn't say that.
Ethans right behind me.  Listen to me Jim.  Is it such a good idea to kill him? We take the money.  Ethan takes the blame.  No-one else has seen you alive. No-one will believe him.
Whos dead?
Passport, visas - you know the drill. We'll work the exfiltration thru Canada, debrief you at Langley.  Throw the Prague police a bone, you know toss them a few suspects.  Follow me?
That's right.  Max, it seems, has two unique gifts -- a capacity for anonymity and for corrupting susceptible agents. This time he's gotten to someone on the inside - he's put himself in a position to buy our NOC list. An operation he referred to as "Job 314".  The job he thought Golitsyn was doing tonight.
Kittridge.
If you're dealing with someone who's crushed, stabbed, shot and detonated five members of his own IMF team, how devastated do you think you're going to make him by marching Ma and Uncle Donald down to the county courthouse?
What makes you trust me?
Reach your folks?  How they feeling?
Here's to  you, Luther.   To being off the disavowed list.
The penny drops.  <u>You</u> are <u>not</u> Job.  Yes, Job is not given to quoting Scripture in his communications. And there was its tone -- aggressive but playful.  Job is not playful.  So you're something of a paradox.
It's quite out of the question.
Why, may I ask?
I'm going to have to front you personally.  Don't lose that money without losing your life.
Merci.
Jack.  Jack.
In position.  Jack open the door, let the package roll.
Sarah eye on the package.  Jim, Im coming to you.
Then what am I doing here?
Yeah, well, Jim, fact is I've got more than ninety days leave coming.
Oh?  What's the problem?
Tell you what?
What problem?
I guess.
You're going to use Walter?
Isn't he chairing the Armed Services hearing?
Sure.  If the main character does.
Where are you?
Jim, who do you think you're kidding?  A doctor's gotta look at that.  You can't sit up straight.
..when you think about it, Ethan, it was inevitable..no more Cold War.  No more secrets you keep from everyone but yourself, operations you answer to no one but yourself.  Then one morning you wake up and find out the President of the United States is running the country - <i>without your permission</i>.  The son-of-a- bitch!  How <i>dare</i> he?  You realize its over, youre an obsolete piece of hardware not worth upgrading, youve got a lousy marriage and sixty-two grand a year.  Kittridge, well go after that no good son-of-a-bitch, big time!
Before London.  But after you took the Bible out of the Drake Hotel in Chicago.
I knew about Jim.
No, in your...ear piece. You have a lovely smile . Can you hear me now?
Why don't you take a look?
That's what we do isn't it?
Too wicked to have a drink later?
Such a nice ass.
Twenty-six, twenty-seven.  So far so good.
Oh, you're not going. You're staying.
The Shawfish?
Then, I suppose the time has come say it's been nice Dwight Lionel. It's been everything. Oh, Dwight, I'm frightened.
Who's dead?
I won't pay for nothing.
You're welcome.
Have I been a good wife?
A man... under stands one day... that his life is built on nothing. And that's a bad, crazy day.
I don't know what you mean.
Where's Ma?
You look tired.
I didn't have no wedding cake, no reception or nothing. Johnny got down on his knees and proposed to me at The Grand Ticino.
It's temporary.
I got it done.
You're my father.
And then there is copper, which is the only pipe I use. It costs money. But it costs money because it saves money.
Oh, Cosmo!
What do you want me to do? Pick up after five dogs? I'm eighty-three years old. God in his heaven understands that I cannot pick up after five dogs.
Yes!
Yeah, this is Ronny.
I have no life. My brother Johnny took my life from me.
That's it.
I like it well done.
Why?
I don't know.
How many men since then?
I don't care about Luck, you understand me? It ain't that.
I can't believe what is happening.
What? What have we done?
You're invited to the wedding! It's in a few weeks. Why didn't you do like him and be with your dying mother in Palermo?
You don't get along with anybody!
I'm telling you you can't.
Thank you!
So. Where are we sitting?
No thanks.
What do you want to do now?
I'm here!
This is your place.
He's coming.
Will you marry me, Loretta Castorini Clark?
It's Johnny Cammareri.
Will you marry me?
We got married at the City Hall and I think it gave bad luck the whole marriage.
Right from the start we didn't do it right. Could you kneel down?
What about the wedding?
How near is she to death?
Have you told her we're getting married?
I can't. I need my family around me now.
Johnny, I have something to tell you.
In time, you will see that this is the best thing.
No.
Why not?
So we'll sell the house.
How's the mother?
Thanks. What's the matter with you?
What the hell happened to you?
Your hair's different.
Are you drunk?
What? He's in Sicily!
A miracle? This is modern times! There ain't supposed to be miracles any more!
Hi, Loretta.
We just come from the bank.
Twice I took the name of God in vain, once I slept with the brother of my fianc, and once I bounced a check at the liquor store -- but that was really an accident.
I... a... slept with my fianc's brother.
Don't fight.
Don't make yourself sick.
So.
Maybe I should go?
That's it! That's the reason!
Ronny! Our mother has recovered from death!
Because my mother was dying! But now she's not.
Do you have a girlfriend?
When I was twenty-seven years old, in Jersey City, I asked a woman to marry me. She had red hair. She smelled a jasmine. She wore black shoes with pointy white tips.
Don't mind about me. But could you do me a favor and clear her place and take away all evidence of her, and bring me a big glass of vodka?
My lady friend has a personality disorder.
Sheila? Yes she was. Is. Was.
Go ahead.
May I walk with you a ways?
That's my house.
Look.
It's Cosmo's moon.
A witch,  a witch,  burn her!
Burn her anyway.
There are?  Tell up.  What are they, wise Sir Bedevere?
I see.  Yes, of course.
Halt!  Who goes there?
What?  Ridden on a horse?
Well, this is a temperate zone.
It's not a question of where he grips it,  It's a simple matter of weight - ratios ...  A five-ounce bird could not hold a a one pound coconut.
Well, who is your lord?
A what?
Oh, Knights of Ni, here is your shrubbery.  May we go now?
What is that?
You stupid bastard.  You havn't got any arms left.
Come Here.
Hello.
I am King Arthur and these are the Knights of the Round Table.  Whose castle is this?
Who ... Who breaks out?
They're nervous, sire.
Greetings Tim the Enchanter!
That is our quest.  You know much that is hidden O Tim.
Where?
Behind the rabbit?
... You silly sod.
What I object to is that you automatically treat me like an inferior ...
I told you,  We're an anarcho-syndicalist commune,  we take it in turns to act as a sort of executive officer for the week.
... but a two-thirds majority ...
You can't expect to wield supreme executive power just 'cause some watery tart threw a sword at you!
I mean, if I went around saying I was an Emperor because some moistened bint had lobbed a scimitar at me, people would put me away!
Come and see the violence inherent in the system. Help, help, I'm being repressed!
Oh, Did you hear that!  What a give-away.
Sorry ...
Well?
What is your name?
Why?
They cost fifty pounds each!
You killed eight wedding guests in all!
'Mm ... very nice castle, Camelot ... very good pig country....
No!  Not the curtains, lad ...  All that ...  all that you can see, stretched out over the hills and valleys ... as far as the eye can see and beyond ... that'll be your kingdom, lad.
Rather what?
But, Father.
We don't need to do anything, apart from just stop him entering the room.
Oh, I remember ... can he ... er ... can he leave the room with us?
Oh, yes!  we'll keep him in here, obviously.  But if he had to leave and we were with him.
Until you, or anyone else ...
Right.
Yes ...  make sure ...
You were, Sir Galahad, You were in terrible peril.
Hurry!
Brave Sir Robin ran away.
So?
Sixty.
She'll get over it.
She'll drop you.  When she's done with you, she'll drop you.
What's this?
Mr Disraeli.  Ma'am.
I fear the influence he has on her. The man's word is not to be credited. He is an arriviste of the very lowest water.  She's having a bust cast of him.  In Nero Marquino marble.
Surely it is for the gentlemen to decide when to stop...
But mama, the room was built expressly for that purpose.  It has been a smoking-room by tradition ever since father --
Mr. Carter, the Head Butler, sits there.
I'm sorry?
Her Highness' Equerry.
Then we'll have to see what can be arranged.
No.
That can wait till the weekend.
Don't think I can't persuade her.
Nobody has any rights over me.
Princes and Lords are but the breath of kings, An honest man's the noblest work of God.  You must miss such magnificent views.
Surely --
To have achieved one's ambition, or to have reconciled oneself to its limits, is a lifetime's work.
For Her Majesty.
You will not be unaware of the threat now posed by Republicanism.
Your family sent cards.  It was much appreciated.
My husband was always very complimentary in speaking of you.  He would have approved, I am sure, of my calling on you in this way.  I trust it does not inconvenience you too much.
You have been told repeatedly not to stand in the courtyard unless requested to do so.
If Prince Albert were here today, he'd tell him a thing or two.
What are those?
He has been attending at Balmoral for many years.
His remarks were directed at the quality of the writing, not its subject.
Am I not safe enough with you, John?
Has someone seen to those bruises?
I cannot believe you are saying this? You, who I have relied on all this time --
-- You stand there and tell me it is my duty ... after all you promised me!
You should never have gone out in such foul weather.
What can we do?
I stay here because I am happy.  Is that such a terrible crime?
In the press, perhaps.  But she's sold more copies of her Highland Journal in three months than Punch will ever sell in a year.  Time to wheel her out.
The Queen wishes to publish an account of him.
Where did you find it by the way?
We're expecting Brown this afternoon, ma'am.
Excellent, ma'am, excellent.  But perhaps if her Majesty were to consider accompanying her new-found physical vigor with the benefits of mental activity...
The Royal Family and senior members of the household, ma'am.
Sir Henry, Mr Brown is standing in the courtyard.  I have no wish to go riding.
Read it.
Who told them that?
Why not?
There is one other matter.
From Princess Helena and other members of your family.
That's a very pretty shawl you are wearing, Alex.  Silk suits you well.  But you are not eating enough.  One must not let vanity overrule one's appetite.
Then why are you not with him?
You've got your ten levels, right? Here they are...  Each level has an exit, only remember, the exits aren't always what they seem.  First one's The Blood Red Sky, then you've got The Blue Desert, Tower of Ghosts, Kingdom of the Blind...  On each world you have to find a golden key and you've only got so much time to do it in.  If you're too late, The Screamer comes.
Just tell me the fucking riddle.
Thanks, Albert.  Think you could print up those schematics?
We're having some problems with ARCADE...
Maybe he's not dead.
Has anyone seen Greg?
I have to talk to you.
Can you turn off the game?
Sorry.  Maybe I need the Valium.
This is like a movie or something.  I mean, am I paranoid or what?
Then leave her.
The Police, then...
SLIP-STREAM.
You realize that in order to do that, we'd actually have to play the game.
Thanks.  Always wanted to do that.
I'll take the lead and handle the physical threats.  You watch the elapsed time and look for exits.
Okay.  It's West.
What the fuck is that?!
What did he do to you?
Mom?  You're alive...
But I don't understand...
I love you, Alex.  I never wanted to leave. You know that, don't you?
So what do you think?
It means she's screwed up.
Do you know somebody called the The Cowboy?
Will you meet with him?
I understand, Cynthia and thank you for the offer. I'll find a place. Now go ahead and give the Cowboy a yodel and get back to me.
Beautiful night.
Well, just stop for a little second and think about it. Will ya do that for me?
There's sometimes a buggy. How many drivers does a buggy have?
So, what did they say?
Damn lot of corn raised in Hollywood these days too.
Your Aunt called me.
You're really something Coco...thank you.
No, no. I'm on my way to my audition. Before I go I wanted to ask you if you could remember the man's name ... Aunt Ruthie's friend who helped put this together. It completely went out of my mind.
I'm Wally Brown. Your Aunt is a very dear friend of mine so it's particularly nice to meet you.
Hi.
Yes?
That's where I was going... Mulholland Drive.
"You're still here?"
Oh, no wonder I'm starving. I'm going to fix a sandwich. You want one?
Is everything all right? Is it bad for you that I'm here?
Rita... I want you to stay here and you don't have to give me that money.
You're so easy.
It's kind of embarrassing but,
Sammy thinks the Caddy had stopped along the shoulder ... man up the road said he saw two cars drag racin'...then you got that blind corner.
Nice wallets.
Well he said...  you know in his way... you know what I mean? Besides the guy gettin' rolled up under the kids car which busted him up pretty bad, there was this little knife-like torn piece of metal, you know, off the car body, rolled out and slid up through this guy's neck and just kinda slit his aorta, you know, but they didn't find it right away, so the guy's losin' a lot of blood, you know, to the brain - all this time cause it was just like this thin little puncture wound on the surface of his neck that kinda sealed itself, he said, while inside the aorta is bleedin' pretty steady all that time. So, Dr. Scott's laughin' you know like he does 'cause he knows we want to talk to this guy. He's laughin' you know and shakin'... Son of a bitch couldn't stop laughin'... It was kinda contagious 'cause pretty soon we were all laughin'...the nurse was laughin'. You know how he is.
So man, that's unheard of ... an accident like that ... who coulda foreseen that.
Oh, things aren't so bad. Gee, I hope you're not goin' to get in any trouble.
So many tubes to get in, only one is the way out.
Good morning. What do you have today ?
Why don't you tell us what the fuck is going on ?
Now what the hell are we supposed to do ?
Who the hell are you anyway ? What is this place ?
Then he isn't embezzling either is he ?
Hey ! I'm still your best chance to get out of here alive.
It won't take them that long to figure out we weren't on the train when it wrecked.
I was lured by all the money and I truly did convince myself that what I did was for justice. Since then, McCay has wanted to put anyone he can down here.
There are other things too. They had everyone start taking those psych tests. Did they make you take one ?
How can you just take a life ? I mean it's a life, life is so precious.  How does it feel ?
I... I .....
Just remember, hold your breath as long as you can. Then go right over to that corner. The door will open and go in and up.
You okay ?
Where are we going ?
Do you know where you're going ?
What was that ?
What about you ?
That was eleven years ago.
Are you Matthew Parker ?
That's very funny, sir. You are under arrest.
OUCH !!! GODDAMMIT that hurts !!!!
Hey buddy, thanks for the help back there !
Hey, try swimming. It works.
It's my control board and I don't want it acting squirrelly because you dropped a few crumbs into the keyboard, no put the shit away.
He'll never get it right. Try the Log Ride !
But, he's...
Johnny, let's get the cleanup started.
I made my bones on the street, you know. I did Riglioni in his own house. I was made in the Family, okay.
Yeah, maybe.... Let's start the background checks. Let's see where they live and what kind of security systems....
Any priors ? Any police record ?
Why don't you just stop fucking around and just die !
Zach, how old are you, son ?
Zach my boy, I can spend your yearly salary in a blink. I have had that kind of money all of my life. If I wanted to, I could fly to Paris for the afternoon.  My father formed this company over seventy years ago. When my brother became mentally challenged, it was put in my charge. Now running a bank of this size is very stressful. I need to relax on what little down time I have. A yacht club will not quite make my blood pressure decline. Understand ?
I want more action. I want to see more ingenuity than that. I want to see the injured man out wit the machines !
What if we were to put Bruce into the Park as a Guest ?
Do you think the assistant, what's his name...
Is it as good as I hope it is ?
Might I ask why you no longer work for the mob ?
Have you ever considered running your own "Park" ? I mean, since you will not be returning to your former profession.
Are you happy with your salary and position ?
Bruce has just awaken.
What the ... ?
Come on, I'm serious. Look at Wilma. She's this frail little thing, and Fred, I mean Fred Flintstone is this BIG guy. He has to be hung like a horse, and THAT's why Wilma puts up with his B.S.
Would that impress you ? I mean you're the kinda woman that probably has Ferrari written all over your personal ad.
Hey, you ! What the hell is going on ?
The roof is coming down.... hey, you.... Which door gets us out of here ??
It's that asshole Zach isn't it ?
Are you okay ? Any holes ? I mean aside from the one's that nature gave you ?
Thanks a lot. I always wanted to know what it was like to see my life flash before my eyes for the one hundredth time tonight.
Good morning.
My mother took this course with you at UCLA...&quot;The Foundations of Poetic Thought&quot;.
Her name was Maggie Muldovan.
People said she looked like me.
Put that down, I'll...I'll call the police!
Wow, you walked out with my mother?
She was the uhh...first girl ever suspended for smoking.
I'm not authorized to trace licenses for civilians.
Yeah, this is Sergeant Tanaka from Holenbeck, I need a current address for a Jeffrey....
Pommeroy...he may or may not be driving a black 54 Ford Pickup.  Monday.
Do what?
Okay, no problem.
Visualize a spare?
So, what's on your mind?
Ahh, strike, not, not bad at all. No, this talk isn't about sex, it's, well there've been a lot of changes, and I know you're upset about losing your room, but the baby's gotta go somewhere.
Seriously.
The Collected Works of Alfred Biedermeyer
We have a baby?
Can I see him?
Yeah and they forgot to ask for one who wasn't having hormone surges.
And she saved it.
Well I didn't know about you until after she was gone.
Maggie wanted to have a baby...and...umm...I didn't.
I know that.
Vada, he was giving you an easy out so you wouldn't have to write about your mother.
You're crazy, what was her big achievement? Did she invent gravity?
What can I do for you?
If the fruit burst into flames I'll be prepared.
Thanks....
You know eavesdropping is a very unattractive habit.
I didn't ask for the money, Phil just gave it to me.
Vada.
I don't think anybody should change their names, that way you can always find them when you need them.
You ratted on my mother??
Look at it this way, however bad I feel, it isn't as bad as becoming extinct in a bottomless pit of tar.
You are weird. Let's just go.
Does it work?
I'm not gonna break it, I just wanna see it change colors.
Woah, watch it!
It's dangerous!!
You mean,  this ring?
Oh no, we wouldn't be from the same bloodlines or anything. We'd be like two total strangers who...accidentally had relatives that got married.
Marriage can really complicate things. So, aren't you gonna say anything about my earrings?
And I'm gonna use the movies when I give my report. Jeffrey says audiences love special effects.
Write me a poem?
What's it for?
Wow!
And you certainly shouldn't settle for anything less that you deserve.
How about Nick? Did he take good care of you?
I had to be, I only have five days. So just point me in the right direction and....
I'd like to see his house but...I don't know if I'd have the nerve to just go up and knock on his door. I don't think I can go through with it.
I should do this myself.
We may go out for coffee after the meeting so don't expect us before midnight.
Yes, what kind of arrangement? I'd be very interested to know what kind of an arrangement we have.
I mean...with your car.
Oh, you mean you...fix the hearts...of little babies?
Ahh, Dr. Helburn, why don't you come in tomorrow-morning at eight o'clock, that's when we open, we'll get you started.
Good morning.
Oh no, I, I...eh...I couldn't.
Let's just say I...eh...I'm involved.
Ahh, why don't I come in first thing in the morning and you can check out that left blinker for me.
Assuming the baby's a &quot;Supremes&quot; fan.
No, the milk comes when the baby comes.
Oh, I was a very late developer, they used to call me &quot;Shelly Two Backs&quot;. All my friends had real bra's, not like the training ones I had.
Well, it must mean something. She was obviously very sentimental.
Is that why Uncle Phil moved there?
I wonder why she got a passport if she never went anywhere.
Oh, but I'm not due to have the baby for another six weeks or so.
Did it hurt a lot?
Beidermeyer?
Hey, you didn't pay me!
I've been living in it for over a year, the camper is mine.
God I guess i'll have to introduce you now.
Ex...ex, ex...
It's there.
Can not do without, Harry's wild about me.
I do enjoy playing bingo, if you'd like to join me for a game tomorrow night at church you're welcome to.
Does it make it easier to win?
I just had a terrible thought Harry.
I'm gonna be putting makeup on some of these people very soon.
No, why?
Kiss me.
I'm just picking some things up for the barbecue.
Danny that's a real _bonehead_ thing to say!
Yep, there they are... They always look the same every year...
Ahem.
Shelly thinks I'd be a good writer.
Are they ready yet?
When?
We're having the wedding sometime near the end of the summer.
Maybe I should go over and yell at him.
Why not?
In the garage.
What was my mama like?
That's true. Harry Harry sit down, let me fill you in on today's women, since the last time you dated, something happened, &quot;The Sexual Revolution&quot;, now before that, you used to have to hold a door open for a woman, pull her chair out, pick up the check, no more no more, you wanna know what else is missing? BRAS!
Oh she's picking you up, good you're on the right track.
Yes she is, but she's very upset, so she's not seeing anyone.
Mademoiselle Sultenfuss and the amazing Dr. J! How's the summer treating you?
This is one big house for one single person.
Uhhh, va, uhh, Vada.
Okay, okay we don't have to talk about him, Vada, Vada we don't have to talk about him, it's okay. We won't talk about him all right?
I love you like my Dad loves Shelly. I wanna live here.
Really?
Is that your camper?
Ooh, that's a pretty ring you're wearing.
Hi.
Are you married?
Bye. Well Miss Vada, what d'you say we head back?
No.
Do you like putting makeup on people?
Vada? Would you like us to get you another goldfish?
NO!
It's okay sweetheart.
Oh great!
Hey look at this, no feet!
Yeah he got away. Come on let's go.
What's wrong with your eyes?
Who's that with your Dad?
What do you think it's like?
Sorry.
They're not gonna let us in Vada, we're kids.
Are you crazy, you'll get stung!!
I'm hungry, I can't last any longer.
You can come to my house for dinner?
Uh huh.
Just do it.
Needs salt.
Sometimes I do.  Like for two months.
Same difference.  If you love someone, it's your duty to save them from themselves.
There are 18,250 nights in the next 50 years...
Zit cream?
I give.
How do you know you can touch that plug? Are you a licensed contractor?
Needing.
Digger and George are with family in the Hamptons until Monday morning.  Brevity is even more in order than usual.
I did what I came to do.
I thought bridesmaids had to wear the same dress.
It depends.  If San Antonio sweeps Sacramento, we could start there. Or Phoenix.  Or depending on Indiana- Clevel...
And loving him means loving all of this.
You'll always be there.  In his mind.  The perfect creature he loved for all those y...
But he always says...
Gold dog collars? They don't have dogs.
Look at all this beautiful food, so lovingly prepared...
When are you gonna come clean with your folks?
If you're waiting for "Do you take this man?", that's considered poor form.
Well.  See.  That was a... reflex to see if it would...
Ex-cuse me?
And you think he's kept this to himself.
I thought Michael was picking me up.
Well, that's great.  You haven't really had anybody since Dingbat Jennylee...
Please come, please.
Where was that, Florence, huh?
Pretty amazing girl, you've got. Make that kind of sacrifice.
Wow and wow.  You have a date, after this?
No problem.  A little bullshit about Daddy's "needs," and presto, I'm a lap dog in high society.
Big weddings are so strange.
Don't you throw up on boat?
I've been thinking a lot the last couple days.  About us, actually.
Well.  There's a lot of memories to choose from...
I can hardly wait for your wedding.
I forgot how cute you look.  When you get impossible.
This thing means that much to y...
Michael...
I was so confused, so conflicted, so... unstable.
What's up?
Lower.
You can't believe you've lost her!  Sooner or later, you'll find her, and you'll look in each other's eyes, and you'll see all that love...
Because I could come...
All of a sudden, I'm supposed to drop out of school, forget my family, forget my career, forget all the plans I had for my life...
Kimberly wanted to tickle the grandmas, so we figured, give 'em a cheap thrill.  Walter supplied the decorative touches...
You got the money?
I remember when I just saw you. Skinny Winnifred. Jesus, you were skinny.
What?
I hate that music.
We have a Bible study meeting tonight if you'd like to come.
No.
I called Connie and she said not to worry, She'll fill in for you.
Then why are you listening to her -
You have to what?
Oh, Barnett, I'm so sorry.
Don't worry, I'll take care or it
Am I disturbing you?
I'll tell Ester, she'll be thrilled I saw you again.
Well, that's not entirely true, Barnett. At least not according to Haven.
His Word.
I got trapped and you know it, so let's have some rules.
You want anything?  A drink?
What's he running for?
Bastard
It's an appearance. It has nothing to do with support. I don't even like him.
You're kidding.
Thanks... I'll... go say hello to your mom.
Oh... Well... Have you heard from Barnett?
You bet.
Business School so I can run Haven's business.
Sure... you're a fine boy, Ken, you really are.
Uh huh.
All they got is advertisements. Just like L.A.
You must really like him.
You in music?
Mom?
I'm in a rooming house with Mr. Green.
I don't think so.
Do you ever do any writing?
Yes.
Who is thin?
Oh.
Stay.
How old are you?
I'm forty-six. Do you like to go up or down?
Are you sure you know what you're doing?
Wednesday at the park. We've got a lot of names coming in...
You don't know how pleased he'll be.
Where are you going?
We just got a gold record.
Dent it a little. Boy -- just she couldn1t even find it. She had a hamburger on her desk that looked three weeks old.
Probably a little too long.
What do you think of him?
He is to a lot of people.
Spent time in Arizona. Why?
Ah... Peter Finch.
Peter Finch -- he's English.
Ryan O'Neal.
Oh, you meet them at parties and stuff.
You think it will?
Hi, I'm Sueleen Gay.
What was the color of Tim's belt?
Is that a fact? Well then, Grace, could you tell us what form of martial arts it was that Tim was schooled in?
Now, while I freely admit total ignorance on the subject, I have heard of Bruce Lee. And I was under the impression that Bruce Lee was one of the, if not <u>the</u> greatest fighter in the history of martial arts.
Point of fact, weren't Tim's hands registered as lethal weapons?
What did you think then?
Naw, she don't mind.
You got something you want to do?
Mickey!
Who is we?
Who isn't?
You've heard of it?
The public loves you Jack...You don't mind if I call you Jack, do you?
Did you ever see 'Eldorado?'
Okay, buddy boy, where ya keepin' Mallory? I know she's still here, and I know you know where. So, start talking or my first work as a director will be your death scene.
Yeah. Ya see, I ordered that special.
Do you have a back up.
My problem Mickey, is that you don't exactly inspire empathy. I'm all alone on this. I need your help. I want what the prison board is doing to be the focus of our follow up episode. Now I have interviews with chairman of the prison board Dewight McClusky about this issue. And I'm tellin' ya, Mickey, he looks bad. The two psychologists they used for their psychiatric kangaroo court won't talk to us, which always looks bad. I have an interview with both the judge of your trial, Bert Steinsma, and the psychologist and author, Emil Reinghold, both of which discount the notion that you're insane. You put that all together, and what the state is doing becomes obvious. But the network isn't satisfied. They feel the show needs another element. It needs you. In order to put the show on the air, I need to get an interview with you. You haven't talked to the press since your trial. Now, a few days before you get transferred to an asylum, you grant an interview on television with Wayne Gayle. We're talkin' a media event here. Every son of a bitch out the with a TV set's gonna tune in to see that. We'll make their motives so blatant, we'll shame 'em into dropping the whole thing. At least for a little while, the publicity would keep them from just giving you and Mallory lobotomies. Well, whatta ya say?
We're about ready to go here. Are you ready?
So, Mickey, tell us what you do for fun.
Was what worth it?
Was an instant of purity worth a lifetime lie? Yeah, it was.
Tell me about the purity.
I could go for a Coke.
Where's it parked?
Wait! You can't kill me. Mickey and Mallory always leave somebody alive to tell the tale.
I can't go. I'm too fucked up.
If they stay, they'll catch you, and they don't have to catch you---
Mickey, you're wasting time!
Yeah baby.
How can you say that you 'admire' them?
And they made the first move?
---and a snake-eye glare, Arnold was able to totally psyche out any confidence Ferigno had.
Only on a much grander scale.
That's the Mickey and Mallory way.
Apparently, they've seen all our films.
So, Mallory calls 911 and they took off.
Here's the layout of the laundry room.
Take a wild stab!
Are you all set?
We got tonight and tomorrow to get our shit together. The day after that they're shippin' Mallory. That's when we do the Mickey Knox interview, 'cause the next day he goes.
But how can you say that?
But you see, that's okay, Wayne.
You met the kids I have working for me? Great bunch, aren't they?
Scott, genius cameraman, Roger, magician with sound. Unruly Julie, I could sooner do without my arm than Unruly Julie.
Well, just what the hell do you expect me to do?
Mr. Gayle, do you have the slightest idea how dangerous Knox is?
No, no, no, no, no, no, I mean only two guys.
Want me to come?
You know, Doris - you'd make some guy a swell wife.
Fill her up?
That'll be thirty-eight cents.
I bet she's a sly little nigger, that girl. Wouldn't mind a piece of her myself!
'You Duff Anderson?
James Lee, you come in here and meet your daddy.
Well, she never gave me none. Look, you better find him a place pretty quick.
Don't say much, do you?
No. What you usually say, I guess.
That's two bucks, Joe.
Oh yeah?
Yes, aren't you?
Yeah, and you keep not answerin', too.
Hell!
I guess it's hard working on the road like that.
Well, let's see now - not counting tonight ... must be about twenty-eight times.
Let's go, Duff.
You got more guts than me, baby. It's a no-good town.
But I would like to see you again.
I wouldn't have let you.
Look, Duff - most of the men I know - they're kind of sad. When I met you the other day I had a feeling that you're different. That's why I went out with you. I thought we might have something to say to each other.
Ain't your fault.
Surprised?
That's right.
Hi.
I'll have some coffee, please.
Don't push me, Duff.
I can see why.
Everything you cook is good.
Hmmm - good coffee.
Baby, you're the best thing that ever happened to me.
It sure scares you, a guy like that - settin' out on his porch, doin' nothin'. I seen hundreds of them - all my life.
How would you like to have a baby, Duff?
Don't deny me, Duff.
I could work even after the baby comes. A few hours a week, anyway.
You heard me!
How come you don't hate their guts?
Hell, if they don't blow up his place, they'll get him some other way. Don't make no difference no-how.
Where' you goin'?
What's so hot 'round town?
Just get her drunk.
That's right.
'See ya.
Nothing. Heard you were in town.
No.
My son? I ain't got no son. You Duff?
Take it easy, Pop.
What did you say, boy?!
Want to come up the house? You can stay there till you get on your feet. There's no point paying a hotel.
They'll run you out.
Don't be too hard on him.
Well, you've got to go easy. We haven't had any trouble in town for eight years, and we're not going to have any now.
I think if you tried livin' in a town like this, instead of running free and easy, you'd soon change your tune.
Oh yeah?  Seems to me, Reverend, you' more concerned 'bout your good. Guess it looks kind 'a bad, havin' me for a son-in-law.
Why don't you guys buy your own?
Man, you won't like that back seat.
Well, if it ain't Duff!
So you're courtin' the preacher's girl. Well, just watch your step, boy, or he'll preach you right into hell.  I'm counting on you, Reverend.
I'll talk to the Mayor.
Let's stay here, Will.
Is she good in the hay? No point marryin' her just to find out. Is there, baby?
Omar--
Whoa.  No way.  You can't enter the kill zone.
So don't pull this cowboy shit now. You'll give him a target.  You'll get yourself killed.  Just keep talking.
We got any shots?
Oh my God, I'm terribly sorry. Did I hurt you?
Peter said you came to kill us. Is that true?
You didn't come here to destroy Wintermute. You can to save a man you love. A man who isn't even capable of returning that love. Such a waste...
What about her?
Can you get us into Straylight?
Alright. Let's talk business.
Are you sure you're up to this, Mr. Case? We could reconvene tomorrow.
Our analysis of the London stock crash suggest that it was manipulated from within the international computer matrix. Cyberspace, Mr. Case... A realm I believe you're familiar with.
If someone is infiltrating the matrix on a global scale no political or economic system is safe. I'm assembling a team of specialists, Mr. Case. We need a man who can enter the matrix and trace this saboteur.
Who's running the show, Armitage? This a government sting?
I'll think you'll find everything in working order. Molly's just having a little fun.
And then?
You ran without us.
Sorry, bullshit. We haven't even begun and you're already jeopardising this operation.
As long as you cooperate.  I want it now, Armitage.
Honesty. Almost as quaint a notion as your concept of good and evil.
Tell me the words.
The access code to your mainframe.
Then I'm out. I don't give a shit about you or this run.
Ah, Herr Case. And how is the artiste tonight?
Case... Yeah, Miami Joeboy, quick study. How you doing, kid?
What elders?
Case, mon, you just tell me who not to kill.
Four men. Babylon soldiers.
I can't feel nothing because I am nothing.  Just playback. A ghost in the machine.
Who got you into this?
He was an M.P. in Bangkok back in '21. Caught some shrapnel in the cerebral cortex and wound up living off a machine in a vegetable ward in Berne. Then, last September... surprise, surprise... he just seemed to disappear.
It's possible. The guy was a blank slate.
Could be suicidal. It's not easy to kill yourself with all those hard wired defence programs.
Yeah, but it ain't doing us any good. The way this is set up, I can't run shit unless I get inside its perimeter... and this goddamn thing would see me comin' from a mile away.
One minute eighteen and counting. What about the access code?
What about the mainframe's access code?
Why did you come here tonight, Linda?
I hear that shit once a week. Don't worry. Jo Jo Bao loves me.
Where did you here that?
I can no more shut down my own natural defences that you can stop breathing. That's why I need you, Case. You're the only person alive who has a chance of penetrating my defences. My "ice" as you call it. I'm doing everything I can to make that possible.
How long have I been out?
Not anymore. You got a new pancreas. Armitage's got you kinked so you can't get stoned.
When I was fifteen Sense/Net iced my old man's credit record over some computer error. Once that goes down, that's it. He lost his business... everything. It destroyed him. I had to hustle arcade games for chump change. Dixie McCoy found me, figured I was a natural. He taught me the wires for a piece of the action.
You scared the shit out of me, man. You were dead for fifteen seconds. Totally flatlined.
Who?
When it's not yours. My mom was going through her Harlequin Romance phase.
So what are your hopes, your dreams, what do you want to be?
Hey, where's your sweatshirt?
Hi. You're here for the sex talk?
I had a lunch break so I thought I'd come by and see you. Your teacher is a fox!  Why don't we discuss that after class. But the burning is totally normal.  Oh look. Class is over already.
Anita!
You need my help?
Wow. It's packed.
What is this?
Oh-my-God. You totally ripped off my Malibu Barbie idea.
He is totally crunching on you.
It's my dad. He worries.  Hi, Dad. I miss you too.
Do you even know these kids?
That's your story!
Not yet. Every person in this office comes in here and watches you guys! It's like the goddamn Young and the Restless! Rigfort's salivating over it.
You know, Adele penguins pick one mate. They spend their whole life looking for that one other penguin and when they find it, they know. That's the penguin they stay with for the rest of their lives.
Rob, take the money, okay? It's no big deal.
These girls are high schoolers? Damn, we've got some underage hotties on our hands, here!
Plus, if you quit you're no better than me.
Josie, finally. I just wanted to come over and make sure you're okay.
No- not really, Josie. NOT REALLY. How could you do that to me?  I helped you. I got you everything you wanted. And how do you repay me- you blow everything TWO DAYS before pro scouts come to see me play. Once they had seen me really play- they wouldn't have given a shit about my age.
Whoa. Deja Vu.
Your writing. It's amazing, Josie. You're really talented. And far less depressing than Dorothy Parker.
Josie you owe it to yourself to go. For your writing. You're a natural.
Yeah. To watch the world go by.--
You set me up. For a story.  You know what's crazy? I was actually considering waiting for you.
Now I don't want to! I bought all of your penguin crap. I thought I found her--the right one! And the problem was she was too young! No - the problem was--she didn't even exist!
The person I cared about wouldn't have done this. Everything out of your mouth has been a complete lie. I don't know you at all. For all I know you could hate Dorothy Parker.
Please. Please don't walk away.
Are you having fun?
Wow - I-
Shock.
<i>                                   ... Let's draw straws.</i>
Taste it.
<i>                      This is a thing called a present. The whole thing starts with a box...</i>
<i>                      Just a box with bright colored paper And the whole thing topped with a bow.</i>
<i>                                     ... Birds of a feather.</i>
<i>                                          ... You're no fun.</i>
I told you I want that room unpacked.
I don't know.  COuldn't get the right price, I suppose.
Oh, come on, Shirl, how'd you think we got such a good deal?  Listen - all old houses have stories.
Don't tell me it's not the gas!  Your mother thought she smelled gas.
There is no Jesse.  I'm Jesse now.
I love you, Jesse.  Come back to me.
So, what about you and that Poletti girl?
You two got a thing going, or what?
Who told you to choke up that way?
Are you nuts or something?
Aren't you afraid somebody could steal your car like that?
You mean a shithead.
That's when she started talking about Fred Krueger.
Look, you got electricity in your body, right?
So, you feeling anything?
Well, what am I supposed to do?
Yeah?
Now, there's an idea we can take off on.  Maybe we should drive out to the beach tonight and lay out a couple of blankets and...  Until I fall asleep.
You want to talk about it?
Jesse, God - what happened?
Who, Jesse?
What's so funny?
'Morning.
Yeah, I'm fine.  Just really hot upstairs.
So, school going alright?
Morning.
Did she always have nightmares?
I'm serious.
Kristen, don't start with me.  You know what your shrink said...
I've been good.  When do I get cigarette priveleges back?
I can see that. You watch too damn much TV.
Oh, right.  You're gonna be a TV star.
If you get caught, I never saw you. Deal?
Horseshit.
So what do we do about this creep?
You didn't think we'd let you go alone?
What's happening?
I used to live in this house.
You like gymnastics?
That was different.
Kristen, can you pull us out?
Hi, sweet stuff.  Good news.
Oh yeah?  Well, if you're ever in the mood for a history lesson, I'm your teacher, understand?
Now who's gonna take the word of a crazy junkie chick like you?
Save your breath, Ms. Thompson.  Dr. Simms gave me specific instructions. Nobody gets to see Kristen -- especially you.  She made that real clear.
I think we can stop him this time. Stop him for good.  But we need to know where the bones were hidden.
Oh God.
You're late.
I'm serious.
That's what I know.
Stop blaming yourself.
The truth.
And you won't make any progress until you can recognize your dreams for what they are.
We'll begin sedation tonight.  Starting with him.
In there.  Charlie Penny owns the place. We knew no one would ever find it.  I'm not even sure I can find it again.
We've got work to do.
How is he?
That's enough, Kincaid.
I'm Will Stanton, and um...I've had a little accident, as you can see.
We are living in cloudcuckooland -- we'll never get this done today.
Splendid.  I'm actually in the stock- market, so not really similar fields, though I have done some amateur stuff -- P.G. Wodehouse, you know -- farce, all that.  'Ooh -- careful there, vicar.'  Always imagined it's a pretty tough job, though, acting. I mean the wages are a scandal, aren't they?
No, thanks.  I'll just look around.
No.  I better be going.  Thanks for your help.
Oh hi.  Forget something?
I apologize for the 'surreal but nice' comment.  Disaster...
Oh hi.  It's William Thacker.  We, ahm I work in a bookshop.
I'm just a complete moron.  Sorry. This is the sort of thing that happens in dreams -- not in real life.  Good dreams, obviously -- it's a dream to see you.
Are you busy tonight?
Well, it was nice to meet you. Surreal but nice.
Busy tomorrow?
I'm sorry.
I'm rash and I'm stupid and what am I doing with you?
Hi.  Can I come in?
Would you?  It's all talk, talk, talk.
'Very well, captain -- I'll pass that on straightaway.'
With a goat playing a violin.
Definitely.  Ths is important stuff.
Rita Hayworth used to say -- 'they go to bed with Gilda -- they wake up with me.' Do you feel that?
Her most famous part -- men went to bed with the dream -- and they didn't like it when they woke up with the reality -- do you feel that way with me?
That's not true.
You're right: of course, you're right. It's just that I've dealt with this garbage for ten years now -- you've had it for ten minutes.  Our perspectives are different.
Excuse me?
But... wait... there are things to say.
But yesterday... that actor asked you who I was... and you just dismissed me out of hand... I heard -- you had a microphone... I had headphones.
... with you, I'm in real danger.  It took like a perfect situation, apart from that foul temper of yours -- but my relatively inexperienced heart would, I fear, not recover if I was once again ... cast aside, which I would absolutely expect to be.  There are too many pictures of you everywhere, too many films.  You'd go and I'd be... well, buggered, basically.
Really -- don't do that -- I'm sure this is not his job.
Can I just say, I thought 'Ghost' was a wonderful film.
Hiya -- sorry -- the guinea fowl is proving more complicated than expected.
Bella -- this is Anna.
Still loves you though.
This painting isn't the original, is it?
That's nice.
Having you here, Anna, firmly establishes what I've long suspected, that we really are the most desperate hot of under-achievers.
Of course it is.  Any favourite among the 22?
I suppose so.
But it's not for the shop.  It's for you.
'No comment' means 'yes.'
Buggered?
I think you have forgotten...  what an unusual situation you have here -- to find someone you actually love, who'll love you -- the chances are... always miniscule.  Look at me -- not counting the American -- I've only loved two girls in my whole life, both total disasters.
There's an understatement.  There are dead people on better form.
Cool, huh?
There never will be, you know, unless you actually clean your clothes.
Who were the ones you didn't write down from?
What did she say?
Spike.  For God's sake -- she's in trouble -- get a grip.
Spike!
I'll talk to you in the morning.
Was it you?
Are you sure you...?
Excuse me.
Bad news.
We've got a security camera in this bit of the shop.
No secrets, Mister Harding. Let's get it all out in the open...
What was it about her that disturbed you so, Billy?
Get up, Billy.
Easy now, don't smudge 'em, we got lots of games ahead of us...
My name is Miss Ratched. I'm the head nurse here. You've already met Miss Pilbow and Aides Washington and Warren.
Yeah, you ain't half so bad looking for a head nurse.
That's all right, Miss Pilbow, if Mister McMurphy does not wish to take his medication orally, he may...
Mister McMurphy, patients are not permitted to run around in towels.
Oh, I had them removed.
Now you boys hurry along and wash up for breakfast...  You too, Mister McMurphy.
Certainly, Mister McMurphy.
That was the first time you attempted to commit suicide, wasn't it?  You must try to talk about it, Billy.
Mister McMurphy, the purpose of this meeting is therapy. Group therapy.
So do I!
Mister McMurphy.
Yes, Miss Ratched?
What I wanna know is who's the top loony around here?
Yeah, that'll do for openers!
Break it up, God dammit! Ain't I got enough troubles without you guys messin' around... can't depend on nobody.
So long suckers.
Whatsamatter, kid, what's botherin' you...?
Candy? Hell no, Billy, she's just a good friend, that's all...
Say... God Bless America!
Ya like that, Chief, huh?
Wait a minute...
What for?
She won't give me any more cigarettes!
Yeah, Mack?
Charlie, ya can't ever let those goons outta ya sight! Understand!
Mine, too!
Yeah, Harding, where do you breathe anyway?
Neither do I...
Well, say, buddy, is that the usual pro-cedure for those Group Ther'py shindigs? Bunch of chickens at a peckin' party?
You boys seem to think you've got a champ in there, huh?
With this thing! I'm gonna put this thing right through the window, that's how!
You're fuckin' A-right, I am!
Twenty-five dollars.
Ya owe me twenty-five bucks.
I said out!
I'm the coach!
You can come back later!
Gimme a cigarette!
Miss Ratched. Given all the conditions of that sublime relationship, coupled with the subsequent annihilation of all that I held to be sacred, mentally, physically and emotionally, the only thing that I can speculate on, at this late date, is how I will justify the very existence of my life, with or without my dear wife.
When?
'Kay, place your bets.
Big king... little deuce... another king... a lovely lady... big ten... and a trey... hey, hey, whadaya say? Ya hit or sit, Martini?
Psst! Hey, Martini, wake up!
Gimme the ball!
Gimme the ball!
Man, there sure is an awful lot of poontang around here.
Yeah, but you know how society persecutes a dedicated man.
Well, ya know, Doc...  Doesn't it say so there?
I don't, Doc...
That's correct, Doc ...
Doc, what can I tell ya?
No, this is my first trip, Doc.
What's troubling ya, buddy?
You think it's funny, huh?
Somebody's coming!
Hey, how's it look up there, big boy?
Well, you boys finish it up an' climb back into your beds. 'Kay?
Hallelujah, brother, now get back in bed!
I'll be very glad to show you around, Miss...
Hey, how ya doin', cutie?
You comin' in to hold my hand?
He's a patient, Rose...
Hit me!
Maybe I'll just use that thick skull of yours as a batterin' ram, Sefelt.
I thought I might donate it to the mess hall.
Of course.  Mister McMurphy.
Don't know if I can hold it that long, Sam.
Who do you like in the opening game, Sam?
How 'bout twenty?
Is everything all right?
The lights were flashing on and off, Mister Turkle.
I want those men put back to bed, Mister Turkle!
And you haven't heard the last of this!
What happened?
Smells like piss. Is this real, Candy? Is this really real? I mean we are in an insane asylum, an' I wanna know how we got ourselves into this scene.
Well, Miss... I would say... I would say, yes. Yes, he's crazy.
He is your husband, no?
May I see your boarding pass, please?
You ask what room he's in, okay?
He said he thinks a woman he works with knows him.  Her name's Anna. But she won't be in 'til tomorrow.
No, really.  What's she doing?
You're sure...
I'm engaged.  I'm supposed to be married in two days.
Yeah, but, what if this guy lived a billion, trillion years ago? Like, what if he was a cave man, and now he's dead?
Don't worry, it's a long story, but I know who he is.  I know where to find him.
I'll bring it back as soon as I can.
So, this is what you do?  I mean when you're not playing other parts?
Smoking or non-smoking?
Where are you going?
How could you do this to me?
There must be something I can do, something I can say to make this up to you?...  Just tell me what it is, I'll say it.  I'll do it. I don't want you to hate me.
Where are you going?  Just-- out of curiosity...
What?...
Say, I saw where they had motor boats for rent down in the harbor. Why don't we all go for an evening cruise around the bay?
Well, how about those old romantic movies with those great stars, huh? Like Audrey Hepburn.
I'm sorry.
Thank you.  So, since I have a few more days of vacation left, I was wondering if maybe you'd want to do something sometime.  I mean, you know, if you don't have... other plans.
I'd call that a yes.  Do I get a hint?
As I recall, you were on your way home.  And I didn't want you to go so, yes, I told you a little white lie.
Really?...
I was hoping for the real thing.
You're Damon Bradley?
Hello.
Sure.
Wait.
So, what are we waiting for?
I don't know, I guess I never really thought about it...  Is Larry here?
I don't believe in statistics.
Scientologist.
What's he do?
I think it was sweet of him to pick it out.
But one day you wake up and realize you've been had.  Of course life isn't like the movies.  That's why there are movies.
Have you seen him with someone?
It was my New Year's resolution to overcome it.
I have vacation time coming to me.
Would you stop saying that?  I need you to do me a really big favor.
Yes.  Cathy Lee Crosby stayed here.
I can't believe we came all this way and he's gone.
You can't really blame him for being upset.  It was an Armani suit.
I just got a dial tone--
So?
We're saved!
You think he misses me at all?
That was a long time ago.
Anna, I'm Faith.  You don't know how happy I am to meet you.  You see, I'm trying to find someone, and--
What did you say to her?
I never even got to be single.
Not if you don't count the sixth grade.
That was really sweet...
I thought you were the one who didn't think I should've come in the first place.
No.  No, you go ahead.
Maybe I can change him.
Well... I ought to be getting home anyway.  The kids'll be back from camp soon.  The house is probably a mess.
I'm fine.  Have you seen Peter?
A porco?
You think I'm just one of those Italian Casanovas.  The guys who try to seduce every woman who comes their way.  Who prey on unhappily married women.  Who lure unsuspecting--
Huh?
And we didn't have to bring another present?
Sociologist.  And because.  Pawn shops are just like prostitutes, farm auctions and coal miners.  They're all for sale, but none of 'em would be if they weren't desperate for the money.
He existed.  He was some kid I knew from Little League.  He was a real jerk.  You say he's a friend of Dwayne's?
Where is she?
And then I saw her.  And all I know is, when I looked in her eyes I saw something... light.  And life and passion and yearning.  And something else I can't even put my finger on, something I'd never seen before--
I mean, realistically, what are the odds that this is a terrific guy?
I'm gonna take her home first.
I'll come over when I'm ready.
Well, where are they?
It'll do.
I make it twentysix twenty-three. You're fifty short, Skins.
After what we been hearing about your brother, I thought your throat'd be kind of dry.
I wish I knew.
What do you want me to do, Johnny?
Gerry G!! You don't want to do that, Johnny! Sure the boy's outa line, but he's just a confused kid.
You said they was only going to talk to him.
You don't mind working once in a while to justify this lofty position?
The complete works of Timothy J. Nolan.
Mmhmm.
Ten cents a hundred pounds on everything that moves in and out. And you don't have to lift a finger. It'll be three-four hundred a week just for openers.
Listen, Terry, these piers we handle through the locals you know what they're worth to us?
Well, then, you know Cousin Johnny isn't going to jeopardize a setup like that for one rubber-lipped
I'm afraid I spoke out of turn last night.
Maybe they just didn't know how to handle you.
What?
Wham... .
Now what are you doing?
I never met such a person. Not a spark of romance or sentiment or or human kindness in your whole body.
Like Joey? Are you afraid to mention his name?
What are you crying for?
I I never knew a girl like you, Edie. I always knew the kind you just grab 'em And I never knew a girl like you, Edie.
Okay, get in hot water. But don't come hollerin' to me when you get burned.
Because... because...  Listen Edie, don't get sore now but I think we're getting in love with each other.
What are you going to do?
It's true.
I don't rate it.
Edie, I need you to love me. Tell me you love me.
Terry, I'm frightened. More and more frightened.
Charley.
I'll take it out of their skulls.
But I feel like My friends won't talk to me.
Every one of 'em... .
Then go ahead go ahead! Go down to the shape-up and get yourself killed, you stupid, pigheaded, son of a  What are you trying to prove? With a decisive gesture Terry takes the hook and sticks it through his belt. Then he goes to the wall and lifts Joey's windbreaker from the nail on which it has been hanging. He puts the windbreaker on in a deliberate way, and grins at her as he does so; then he walks to the door with a sense of dignity he has never had before.
Am I on my feet...?
Pop, don't think I'm not feeling grateful for all you've done to get me an education and shelter me from this.  But now my eyes are open. I see things I know are so wrong how can I go back and keep my mind on things that are only in books and that people aren't living? I'm staying, Pop. And I'm going to keep on trying to find out who's guilty for Joey. I'd walk home with a dozen Terry Malloys if I thought they could help me. I tell you I'm staying, Pop. Pop starts to pull his belt out of his trousers.
Where you goin'?
What's the matter? I've got something That's chokin' me. I've gotta get it out.
It's like carrying a monkey around on your back.
I want to see you, Terry.
This is my business.
...walk?
What do you think?
And I still say you stand up and I'll stand up with you.
You can bring a lawyer if you wish. And you're privileged under the Constitution to protect yourself against questions that might implicate you in any crimes.
I thought you were going to take him that night but...
Condolences. How you fixed for cabbage this mornin'?
What's the matter wit' you, success gone to ya head?
I wonder how long she's goin' to hang around, huh, Terry?
What's wrong with your shoulder?
You come from Green Point? Go back to Green Point. You don't work here no more.  Here, kid, here's half a bill. Go get your load on.
Nothing happened, he says. Some operator you got yourself there, Charley. One more like him and we'll all be wearing striped pajamas.
Oh, he did. Half an hour later a certain Timothy J. Nolan went into secret session with the Commission and he did all the talking.
Guts! A crummy pigeon who's looking to get his neck wrung!  You should have  You should have known better than to trust this punched out brother of yours. He was all right hanging around for laughs. But this is business. I don't like goofoffs messing in our business.
I'm glad what I done today, see? You give it to Joey, you give it to Nolan, you give it to Charley who was one of your own. You thought you was God Almighty instead of a cheap connivinggood-for-nothing bum! So I'm glad what I done you hear me? glad what I done!
You see, Kayo, the good Lord watches over us after all.
The brother of Charley the Gent. They'll help us get to the bottom of the river.
But there're so many wonderful things to write about, Bob.
Your puritan upbringing holds you back from my monsters, but it certainly doesn't hurt your art of kissing.
Well we certainly can't stay here. C'mon.
That's what I want to find out. We have to get help.
Could it be some kind of college initiation?
I'm so frightened.
The ropes are coming loose.
I am--It's our only chance.
You're talking nonsense.
They wouldn't dare put us in the same grave-- <b>or would they?</b>
All right.  Put it on heavy.
<i>Him!</i>  I'll bet he sleeps with all the lights on.
You love me then?
But they are not yet one of us.
She pleases me.  Permit her to live in the World of the Snakes. 
The moon sinks lower into the hills!  We must hurry to the finish.
You had the mummy cancel all the others scheduled for this session.
It's not often an Emperor like <i>you</i> calls on creatures like us.
Then it is some service you desire of us.
No. No! No!
We had lots of snakes in my ancient Egypt...slimy, slinky things.
Did you howl off-key at the moon again?
You know that Super Bowl party?  They changed the date.  It's on <u>tonight</u>, eight-thirty.
Listen to Miss Smarty Mouth.  Out there in the free world.
Listen, Adele, the reason I called, that party is today instead of Sunday. About eight-thirty, like only a few hours from now.  So you'll have to get hold of Buddy, whatever he might be doing...
What're you talking about?
Yes.
Yes.
He didn't hurt you or anything, did he?
You didn't visit him in prison.
Jack came out of a bank he just robbed in Pasadena, couldn't get his stolen car to start.  Battery was dead.  He looks over, sees Buddy sitting in a burgundy Bonneville, goes up, offers him a thousand dollars for a jump. Turns out, Buddy was casing the same bank and saw the whole thing.  Buddy says, I'll take the thousand, but we're leaving in my car, not that piece of shit you come in.  They musta robbed fifty banks together.
I talk to the guy you work for, Emil. He tole me your number and where you live.  See, I'm looking for an assistant and would like to speak to you.
Wait a minute.  Let me have your raincoat.  Somebody forgot to bring me clean clothes.
I don't know why, but every time he opens his mouth I want to punch him out.
I'm just saying she wasn't scared.
I've been dreaming about a hot bath for the last six months.  Soak the prison off me.
Chino's gonna wanna talk to me.
Let's go to Detroit.
Snoopy.  Christ, I thought he'd be brain dead by now.
Whatta you think?
How long you talk to her?
Yeah?  You think he'll let us in, we got Snoopy and the muscle-bound asshole with us?
Let Glenn deal with the Snoop, while we're off livin' the good life.
It took you, what, seven hours to buy a pair of shoes?
So how's that work, a wanted felon socializing with a U.S. Marshal?
Did you give her a jump?  If you did I might begin to understand where your head's at.
I'll make you a deal.  Get out of here. Right now.  I'll do the job with the Snoop, meet you wherever you want and give you half.
Getting me out of Glades for starters.
We made it, didn't we?
I'm going back inside.
What'd you talk about?
Foley made me think of that fella Carl Tillman, the one you were seeing, it turns out the same time he was doing banks.  You recall that?
Karen, I've been with the Bureau fifteen years, on all kinds of investigations.
Put it down or I'll shoot.
Quite a mess.
How much for your company at chow?
Himey here's a pro-toh-jay of mine. He's ranked number thirty-two in the federal prison system.
Reggie, push off and hit, man.  Push him off.
Look, what you worried about Glenn for?  What's he know?
You got two minutes, that's all.  Make up your mind.
So you've done this before, huh?
You know how to use one a these?
Where's your gun, your pistol?
Boy, it stunk in there.
Yeah, went real nice with that twelve gauge, too.  Tell me, why in the world would someone like you ever become a federal marshall?
So, what's <u>your</u> name?  It'll be in the paper tomorrow anyway.
Why, are you famous?
That's funny.
Is that right?
Get your hands up and turn around. <u>Now</u>.
That's my dad.
How do you know?  Wait-- you have my wallet.
Why not?
Whatta you mean <u>we'll</u> make it an island?
Well, we got that out of the way.  Tell me, Celeste.  What do you do for a living?
Is that how you think of yourself?
I like your hair.  And that suit.
Having it cleaned didn't help, huh?
You like taking risks.
I might've smelled like a sewer, but you could tell I was a gentleman. They say John Dillinger was a pretty nice guy.
No, you're right.  Or Buddy.  I won't ask if he's with you or what you're doing here in Detroit.  Or if you've run into Glenn Michaels yet.
You getting serious on me now?
Wait in the car.
I thought you guys were busted.
Looks like tonight.
You don't wanna be standing there, the hacks start asking questions you don't wanna answer.
You're the reason, Jack, I don't keep all my money in banks.
I know what you're talking about.
Tell me something, Jack, how much longer you in here?
I don't know.  I'm not exactly the nine-to-five type.
You goin' right back to work?
Good God... they're shooting Midge!
She did, huh.
Yeah, could be.  Or maybe she thought we'd have a lot to talk about.
Do we have a gun in the car?
Look, I can understand if you and Foley are close.
And is Foley a part of this?
Why's that?
You want to get out of here, run, it'll warm you up.
But listen, Glenn.  If you're lying to me...
Snoopy.  Glenn Michaels.
Listen, Snoopy, I'm on my way up to Detroit and need a place to crash.
You there?
Thing I'm worried about is you.
Foley?  Oh.  No, it was one of the Cubans.  Linares.
You like to sit down?
No.
You fit another Chanel suit in here?
No thanks.
I really gotta go.
Was it Foley?
He remind you of that guy, Tillman?
You like the wild ones, don't you? Tillman, Nicolet and now Foley.  You know, I've always said there's a thin line between the cowboy cops and the armed robbers, all those guys that love to pack.
You gonna go get him?
I was just thinking... you could have a nice time with him on the plane -- like picking up where your interlude, or whatever you call it, left off. And then throw him in the can.
Where's Ripley's safe at, he keep his valuables in.
How do I look, mama?
A'ight, this time we gotta get the motherfuckin' trajectory right...  Okay, on three:  One... Two...
That Bausch & Lomb Saline shit you asked for is gonna be eighty bucks.
Excuse me.  Snoopy?  Did we settle the fish thing?
...the fuck is this...
We'll ask Evelyn.  Evelyn?  Evelyn!
He, I'm R-Red.  Red S-Strange.
You know the football player, Red G- Grange?  Well the guys called me R-Red, cause you know, I'm red...and they thought I was strange, so, you know, Red G-Grange, Red Str-Strange.
You're Walker, right?
Hey.  You.  Mr. Coma.
Shit, he's puking on my feet!
Cock-suckin' right I do!!  In the gun lockers!
Nah, you go on.
Didn't you say you told her not to come?
Then why are you looking for her?
I didn't mean it.
Waitress!  Four beers!
I'm saying now you do know.  So it's time for you to fuck off.
How come you're not pukin'?
Don't blame her, Rafe.  It's not like you're thinking.
You hear my okay?
I'm out of ammo!
We've always tried to beat each other.
Maybe just trying to measure up.
It's not getting any longer.
And I'm on yours.  Land of the free.
Yeah.
Before Rafe left, he asked me to be the one to tell you, if it happened.
Rafe's folks had a crop dusting business, owned their own planes.  Real straight, frugal.  My father was the town drunk. Went to sleep one night on the railroad tracks and was still there when the Dawn Express came along.  Rafe and I were the only ones at the funeral.  He took me back to his house, and I never left.
There are some people who think the outside loop is reckless and irresponsible.
Good luck over there McCawley.  I admire your decision.
I heard what you did.
Sorry to trouble you.
Win?
Thank you, 'Mam.
Hello, Lieutenant.  Good to see you.
Colonel Doolittle pulled the strings, and put me on loan to the R.A.F.  They need pilots, and we need experience.  I leave tomorrow.
What else can we do?
It must of been a convincing letter.
We have achieved surprise, but their carriers are not in port.  I don't like this.
We have achieved complete surprise!  The first wave is returning, the second is attacking now, and we have lost only a few planes.  We can launch a third wave, Admiral.
The Chinese are sending out search parties to try to find the crews before the Jap patrols do, if any of the planes make it.
I have'na been able ta --
You see us as capable of such a blow?
Quite a bit more rain than usual this year. I hope it doesn't spoil the rhubarb.
Let's go.
I may be an old fool, but I think we can help you.
r was worried about you  You didn't even call. You're always on my case if I don't call..
Mom, lots of people are separated and divorced.
1 just did it for the reunion. I thought it would be fun.
You just have to remember... men are like houses and trade upwards... I thought you had a pretty good marriage.
You're kidding...? Carol, you have beautiful hair.
I bet Dolores told Charlie.
I hear she does more than talk with her mouth.
But you love me don't you?
You drive like a maniac!
You know. About what we said on Tuesday. It makes a lot of sense.
Looking good out there.
I noticed you were giving me the silent treatment at lunch. I guess I deserved it. I've been thinking about my three year plan and I think it's unworkable. I must have been delirious.
In the abstract maybe. Get a grip on yourself! But when I imagine you going out with other guys, I feel... ah...
Yeah. Like that.
Charlie, what do you think of Richard Norvik?
He's trying.
I probably meant it when I said it.  Doesn't Lucky Chuckie want to come out?
I'm sorry Charlie.
What are you doing here?
Then it's true, dammit! I had a miserable time tonight 'cause of you. When the Monotones did "Book of Love  Chapter Four you break up, won't you give it just one more chance..." I'm thinking Did we break up? 'Cause if we did, I don't even know about it!. I thought we cleared all that up yesterday. Did that Maynard G. Beatnik give you what you wanted?
You're going to blow it, Peggy Sue. Nobody treats Charlie Bodell like this.
I will be happy if I have you. I love you.
What! What about the group and my singing career? What about me?
Does this mean you like me again?
Forget it, it'll never work.
Let me got! Where are you taking me?
I loved you since the day I met you, and I haven't stopped.
Carol and I saw you with that creep, Richard, today.
Sorry. These fountain pens are so tricky.
Terry, slow down.
Terry! Slow down.
Fine.  ) Grandma, would you teach me how to make strudel?
You know, Peggy Sue, your mother said you had a dream that I died.
Yeah. He's so cool and mysterious.
You don't?
The world is fantastic. It's the ultimate absurd circus. I am shot from a cannon into the energy.
The only thing my father digs is cold, green money. All my mother cares about is her standing at the country club.
A ray of oneness piercing the solitude. Falling bodies in the ecstasy of flesh. You'll be a chapter in my memoirs of desire.
Five more weeks of school. And ten minutes past graduation I'm gone.  To freedom.
But we had heat baby. Passion! Fire! We owe it to ourselves to fuse together.  At least one more time.
Ssh. He's great.
I can dig you being uptight about Rita and Utah. That's cool. But I've got to warn you about something.
Young lady, you're drunk!
If all the kids jumped off a bridge, would you do that too?
Damn that Charlie I
Yes but I was a boy. And I still had hell to pay.
I've heard just about enough of this lunacy! Go to your room!
A new car. We can't afford a new car.
Oh yeah. Charlie. How am I going to handle him?
Come on! Mom said you were sick. You're never happy to see me.
You were always friendly to me. I appreciated that.  You know, this used to be a fantasy of mine.
That's my own theory based on a Mexican food called the burrito. I had it once when my parents took me to Disneyland.
But when did you leave? Are you here until then? Were you there until now? What direction are you going in? Are you a moving point on an infinite line extending into the past? Can anyone do it?
You look pretty good for a corpse.
Look it's very simple. You tell me everything that hasn't been invented yet, and I'll invent it. We'll be partners. Fiftyfifty.
You're taking advantage of a minor.
What will they be made of?
Will you take of f your blouse?
Vision? I'm a walking anachronism! I've upset my parents. I miss my kids. I could be trapped here forever! And poor Charlie...I got pregnant on my 18th birthday and we had to get married. Tomorrow's my birthday! I've got to get out of here now.
Why are you bothering me about this? Can't you leave it be?
Did she always have reporters following her around like this?
That's Renee alright.
Wait, there must be some mix-up. He was... the dog is alive.
Out?
What?
Just out.
Geoff, dinner's ready!  Geoff?!
What are you talking about?
All set?
So where're we going?
Your momma's worried sick over you. You take off in the middle of the night, you don't show up for school. What're you trying to prove?
Zowie...
What's his name?
What was all that stuff about dead people coming back to life?
Is this a good spot?
I've never had anyone die before...  ...but I guess you get over it. I mean, eventually...
You think my Dad'll figure out why he's not getting better?
You ever think about running away?
Geoff?  Anybody see my boy?
Allright. Calm down.
You're leaving the hospital? You're going into the office looking like that? Are you insane?
You got that right, Mikey...  You still believe that, don't you?
Fuck you.
ALLRIGHT IT'S CLOSED!  Jesus!
Maybe I should start making plans, is that what you think? Start planning my memorial service? "Begin to prepare for the inevitable."
I'm not ready to die.
I'm ready...
Longstreet's interested in the Harrisburg deal.
... meanwhile, I'd like to prepare you for a colonoscopy, so we can take a look inside.
I'm trying to help your "partner." You're not a member of his immediate family, I could have you removed from the ER.
New baby?
I was fired by Wyant Wheeler. I plan to bring a wrongful termination suit against Charles Wheeler and his partners.
My lover and I.
Hell, they are staring. What's that shit on your face?
Find a lawyer?
How did they find out?
PARRTYY!
What do you want?
I know a good probate lawyer.
Opera?
Particularly, Charles.
Obviously, at this time, you weren't sick.
A regular all-American guy?
Can you explain <u>why</u> you didn't?
Excellent work, Joe. I thank you.
When? Approximately what year did this event take place?
Some do. I didn't.
No. I can't really see it.
Andy! This is a nice surprise. How are you, hon?
Hi, Mom. How do you feel on your fortieth anniversary?
Were you recently promoted?
Ms. Burton. You're black.
In what way?
Apparently, Mr. Wheeler felt they were too... "ethnic" is the word she used. She said he would like it if I wore something smaller, less garish, and... more "American."
And, when lawyers break the law, when this society loses respect for the law, when that day comes, our cherished institutions will be burned to the ground, and our children and grandchildren will live like savages.
Objection!
Andrew Beckett represented your company in a lawsuit in 1990, is that correct?
Did that thrill, impress and overwhelm you?
Andy. Before we begin, I'd just like to say: everyone in this room is your friend.
Let's put it this way, Andy: your place in the future of this firm is no longer secure.
Sometimes it seems like society is <u>run</u> by these kinds of people.
Good school. What year?
Andrew brought AIDS into our offices, into our men's room. He brought AIDS to our annual goddamn family picnic.
What about other homosexual facilities, whatever they are?
He was doing a great job.
Very interesting, Bob. Let's make a note of that. Andy didn't lose the complaint in his computer. He never put it in. He lied about that, too.
Audrey? Oh, Audrey....
As fast as you can.
Tell me the settlement is right there! RIDDICK, PLEASE!
They're already dead. Get on board.
You barely know them.
What do my eyes see?
And him?
We just keep him locked up forever?
I don't need his life story. Is he really that dangerous?
So now you know.
Didn't bite.
...I don't play that...I don't play that so just try again. C'mon, Riddick, tell me a better lie....
He used that?
Nobody else is going down but me, okay?
What, you think I'm doin' this to prove something?
Little ratty-ass.
...need those cells from the crash ship. Shit, still gotta check out the hull, patch the wings --
You said we were going to trust him now. You said there was a deal.
You're not a real cop, are you? Just some mercenary who goes around talkin' about the law like --
Owens was already dead. His brain just hadn't caught on to that fact.
My first run-in with Riddick. Went for the sweet-spot and missed. They had to leave a piece of the shiv in there. I can feel it, sometimes, pressing against the cord.  So maybe the care and feeding of my nerve-endings is my business.
Look, we gotta think about everyone now -- the kid especially. How scared is she gonna be out there?
How much?
He'll lead you over the first cliff. You know that, don't you?
You give him the cells and the ship -- and he will leave you. He will leave you all out there to die.
So you noticed too?
Hey, <u>you're</u> the one who got me out here, turned me into a goddamn sled dog. An' now you 'spect me to go back like a <u>whipped</u> dog?
Well? Is it just the pump?
Imam. We should leave soon. Before nightfall but while it's cooler.
Why did I fall on you?
When captain went down, you stepped up -- whether you like it or not. Now they train you for this, so --
Owens!
So quiet. You get used to the sounds of the ship, then....
The sled as a shield....
'Cuz you don't spend half your life in lock-down with a horse-bit in your mouth and not believe. And you surely don't start out in a liquor store trash bin with an umbilical cord wrapped around your neck and not believe. Oh, absolutely I believe in God. And I absolutely hate the fucker.
Suleiman!
SULEIMAN!
We got you...it's okay, it's okay...we got you now....
What the hell are these?
Found somethin' worse than me, huh?
Want you to remember this moment, Riddick. The way it coulda gone and didn't.
Are you fuckin' kidding me?
Think about that reward, Johns.
Such as.
Look, it's hellified stuff -- but no different than those battlefield doctors when they have to decide who lives and who dies. It's called "triage," okay?
Then let's not name the Thanksgiving turkey, okay? I assume you still got a shiv.
What, you don't really think they left with their clothes on the lines? Photos on the walls?
Oh., no., sir. I was just assembling my notes.
Seal the cave?
Well, Taylor -- we're all fugitives now.
When are you going to show me what's in the cave?
Now, just a minute --
Don't be foolish. If it's true, they'll have to accept it.
Cornelius has developed a brilliant hypothesis -
-- that the ape evolved from a lower order of primate, possibly man. In his trip to the Forbidden Zone he discovered traces of a culture older than recorded time -
Oh, Cornelius, show some strength!
How did it go?
Geiger counter?
Nothing will grow here .... there's just a trace of hydrocarbons, and most of the nitrogen is locked into nitrates.
Any particular reason?
Objection. The accused is indeed a man. Therefore, he has no rights under ape law.
There is a conspiracy afoot to undermine the very cornerstone of our Faith
Objection! These remarks are profane and irrelevant.
Good morning, Dr. Zira.
You could get hurt doing that, Doctor.
He's trying to form words.
Gone.
And the glory, don't forget that. There's a life-sized bronze statue of you somewhere. It's probably turned green by now, and nobody can read the name plate. But never let it be said we forget our heroes.
No cigar.
I want her.
Shouldn't we be moving on?
Why did you do that? Scrape off your hair?
Lucius.
I told you not to bring the other one.
Yes, Sir. But this -- creature is a special case.
Dr. Zira -- tell Bright Eyes to sit down.
Since the defendant is forbidden to speak in his own defense, he asks that this statement be read into the record.
Well...do you acknowledge kinship with any of these creatures?
A fort! Unconsciously, you chose a name that was belligerent.  Where were you nurtured?
Of course.
Of course.
I don't say he was a man like an Earthman, but I'd call him a close relative, for he was plagued by most of man's ills.  Yet, fragile as he was, he came before you -- and was superior to you.
Then there is another jungle?
Why? From the first, I've terrified you, Doctor. And in spite of every sign that I'm an intelligent being who means no harm, you continue to hate and fear me. Why?
What is this?
Listen-
Cornelius and I have been indicted for heresy. Unless we can prove our theories, we don't stand a chance of acquittal.
Actually, you're a different breed. This creature will never evolve.
What's the diagnosis, doctor? A touch of the sun?
It's humiliating.
Let them talk, Mr President. Let them talk.
But the proof? The doll?
You're dead, you're fucking dead Elias!
...You keep pouring out that suppressing fire, Barnes. I don't wanna be caught out there with my ass hanging out you hear me?
Youse a pig man. I hope Manny get dat laundry gig for' you do.
You gonna wipe your ass dis time?
Say I can dig it. Smoke that shit everything kinda gets weird y'know?  Y'hear that story the gooks is putting chemicals in the grass so's we become 'pacifists' so's we don fight  Where the hell's everybody, they'se gettin high that's what - bunch of hopheads, they think they special...
Shit, I bet I been laid more'n you have.
Where's he from?
Yeah! I got two of them fuckers...
Where's Lerner?
Come on man!
But what'd she actually do?
Dawn! That was it!
Oh shit! Sometimes there's things in my head... man. Grass does that to me, fucks me all up like a crazy Indian...
...you know that night we got hit... I... 
Yo getting there Taylor. You be cool now and I'll introduce you 'round to some of the 'heads'.
You volunteered for this shit man?
Shit! Morehouse and Sal are short. Fu Sheng's going on R&R, you don't want to send their asses out on an ambush. You got the fresh meat Elias.
Excuses are like assholes, Taylor - everybody got one.
Tell Six we need engineers here, this pos. is crawling with traps.
Whatcha doing in the underworld Taylor?
I know Barnes six months and I'll tell ya something - that man is MEAN, red in his soul like a dick on a dog.
Then you jes gonna forget 'bout Elias and all the good times we done had? Right in here.
I didn't like it.
Well he ain't normal that's fo sure.
You wanted to see me sir?
Right...
I'll make one for you.  I live there.
How about taking to Uncle Larry into the old firm? He's a useful guy to have on your side.
We have some nice places around Vancouver.
Nobody gets invited to Clark Brandon's parties. They just go.
The brush-off, huh?
I think I'd like to dance.
Please be a little more careful how you talk, Mr. Mitchell.
I think you're drunk.
They might think I was running away from something.
It might be worth a Martini to you.
And do you amuse the guests?
You're drinking it.
Dance?
I know it's a littler late for an apology.
You said it wasn't a tragedy.
Want a spike in it?
He could hardly help suspecting you.
There's a lot of night left to live through.
Dance? Tonight?
Certainly not to me.
You, too?  My name is Betty Mayfield. I was born, and I am here. Message ends. That's what I told him. He didn't like it.
Why not?
Quite sure you saw him in the hotel lobby?
Anything I can do about it?
I hated to go to that place.  I almost went to the police station instead.
Take me where I haven't the courage to take myself.
I run over to Victoria.  Play some golf with some people I know.  Do it all the time.  That's why I have a cabin cruiser.  Custom- built.Forty knots.  Mr Clark Brandon an almost gentleman of almost complete leisure.  Member of six golf clubs.  Broke 70 once on the Shaughnessy Heights Course.  You have to be good to do that, And if you look out of a front window of the Empress Hotel in Victoria, in a few hours you can look right down on Mr. Brandon's boat, the Valkyrie.  Came alone?  Sure.  He always comes alone.  Mr Brandon's a rather lonely man.
If they had any reason to.  Why make it tough for themselves?  Why go to all that trouble?  Here's an open book.  Close it.  No reason to keep it open.  She was a nice girl, anyway.  And perhaps she didn't kill him on purpose.  Perhaps she didn't kill the other one. You never know.  Give her the benefit of the doubt.  Leave her stay where she is.  Close the book. Finis.
It wasn't the time or place.  Don't worry about the note, baby.  I'm playing for my neck now.
This is it, Betty.  They'll find us again, fog or no fog.
That's an evasion and you know it.
Your family coat of arms, Mr. Killaine?
I'm sorry.
I'll find out, you know. Perhaps not today--perhaps not tomorrow. But in the end, I'll find out.
That's something I can't spare you.  But I won't do it myself.
You've got a couple of hours, maybe.
Not sometimes.  Always.  Just because it is the hard way.  You're that kind of man, Jeff.
Mr. Reed would like you to call him.
And there's a Mr. Goble to see you. Says his business is personal.
That's a nice hard knee you've got, Goble. How'd you like to trade it for a broken neck?
You hurt my feelings. I ought to raise the price to be a thousand.
I go home and paint the kitchen.
Sorry. Another client paid for that. You can hire me not to use it.
Hi Margo. Hello Killaine. You two come together?
What'll you have, Margo?
You make friends quickly, don't you, Clark?
Thank you.
Could be.
How are you two getting along?
Time for a little chat?
Information.
It could have been an accident.
I had a father who knew how to steal.
You asked me where it all came from.
I'm getting positively haggard. In a couple of years people will be describing me as well preserved.
What are you doing here?
One of these days, you're going to wake up in the middle of the night and find that you've cut your throat.
You could have got in that room, just as you got in here. How do I know you didn't kill Larry?
Not a floater.  Only just dead.
Mr. Brandon couldn't be here.  He might have left something for you. What would it look like?
I need a receipt.  Sign your name across the flap.
Unless the gun was slanted up.
She didn't seem the type to lam out--even if she got the chance. That stuff was all gone through last night.  Anything special you're looking for, Inspector?
Was that about the right angle?
No suicide.
You knew Mitchell pretty well, didn't you, Mrs. West?
Other people always know so much more than we know--so much more than they're willing to tell us.
It does.  May I go now? 
I don't understand.
No doubt about that one.
So far.
No.
Am I to interpret that as an order to arrest Miss Mayfield?
Are you a policeman or a soft-headed nincompoop?
I believe you won decorations during the war.
There are people in this world who don't think a police badge is a badge of honor.  I'm not one of them.
I'm afraid you're not very glad to see me, Margo.
Her name's Mayfield. Betty Mayfield.
Margo, darling. You washed me up. Remember? We're just friends. You wanted it that way.
Rich? I haven't the faintest idea. Why?
I've always been a heel. I guess I always will be.
It's the only pose I have left. I'm sunk. Broke. I don't even have my hotel bill.
I seem to remember that you like to help yourself.
What's this?
I didn't mean it that way  I'm sorry.
Of course.
You're very attractive, my dear. And you look very unsophisticated.
Mr. Penfield.  I am sorry to have kept you.
My first husband worked for the BBC.  I doubt if anyone there remembers him now, just another long dead diligent administrator. He would have been useful in the fight to preserve the BBC's independence during the Suez crisis - one of the few things he was passionate about.  I became involved too.  I started work on a book that would have been published on the tenth anniversary of Suez. Then he died, and I loots the will to write it.  By the time I was over his death, other books had been published, and it wasn't worth going on.
To Ann.
She'll be here next weekend.  Why don't you come too, James?  I'll                       * show you the marshes properly.  If you're lucky you might even see the first of the geese arriving from Siberia.
Did he?  I left school and worked for the Labour Party.  My older brother, George, had just been killed in Greece, and he'd been an active member.  I hero-worshipped him.  He was 25 years old ...  It was an exciting time for us, those first couple of years after the war.  We thought the country was about to become a true democracy.  I can understand why people of your generation want to write about that time.  They feel betrayed.  They want to know what went wrong.
Why, is there a new Foreign Secretary?  Who was the old one anyway?
I'll have some of that.
Good.
Are you going to have coffee?
And you'll join me in a sambucca?
Personally James, I'm very excited by this new arrangement we have. It gives us direct access to literally hundreds of American collages.  Twentieth century history is a growth area over there, don't ask me why.  Your readership will be first and second year American collage students...
You know the lingo.  Jolly good. So your language will have to be simple, not stupid, mind, but simple, very, very simple, and always remember it's an American readership.
What did you think of that Wadja film?
Really?  I thought those long flashbacks were extremely good.
It makes me weepy just to remember it.  So we were fine again, and then she got married to Matthew who's a womaniser and a bit of a yob, but quite nice really, makes TV commercials.  What about yours.
Damn.  They're early.
Again?
Look, will you come on a walk with me tomorrow?
We don't seem to get much time to talk.
And the Argies.
Now, top secret file.
You approve!
Get way.  You'll see when I'm ready. First I want you to reflect on my noble behaviour, on how your interests are closest to my heart, how I lay awake at night worrying--
It's obvious what you have to do. Your way into the daughter's pants is through the mother, up the Suez canal...
Fortunate that I was here to keep Susan entertained.
I'm waiting for your mother.
Okay, I will.
Do you want to hear my list of English Kings and Queens?
Not bad.
I've got to be going.  I've got a meeting tonight.
You weren't really interested in Suez at all.  Incredibly enough, you were interested in my wife.
Darling Susan.  You look like an angel.  But where's your hat?
What have you got there?
We'll see what we can do.
What's their program?
I've watched you once or twice.  You surf like it's some kind of street fight.  You jerk along from moment to moment, fighting everything that comes at you.  Always trying to win.
How you figure?
Pure adrenalin, right?!  The ultimate rush.  Other guys snort for it, jab a vein for it -- all you gotta do is jump.
It's a little ceremony we always have at the end of summer.  One last speedstar.
You call him... right now... and tell him to let her go.
Where's Roach?
Three seconds... two... one...
That's right.  And we nailed over a thousand of them.  We did it by crunching data.  Good crime-scene work, good lab work, good data-base analysis.  Nobody had to tackle a car once.  You getting the signal, special agent?
You're a real blue-flame special, aren't you, Utah?  I don't know why they sent you to LA.  Must be an asshole shortage.
Special Agent Utah, this is not some job flippin' burgers at the drive-in. Yes, the surfboard bothers me.  Yes, your approach to this case bothers me.  And yes, you bother me.  You two have produced squat in the last two weeks, during which time the Ex- Presidents have robbed two more banks!!  Do you have anything even remotely interesting to tell me?
Three men dead.  One of them a cop. How's that sit in your gut, Utah?
Added to which indignity, I got three months left to retirement and they saddle me with some blue-flamer fresh out of Quantico for a partner. Some quarterback punk, Johnny Unitas or something.
They don't go for the vault?
You through, Mr. Wizard?  Let me know if you find Jimmy Hoffa under the seat while you're at it.  Hell, it's only 7:30.  The night's still young... you can solve this case and start on another one.
Candle wax.  Car wax.  Mustache wax? Could be anything.  Guy's waxing his mustache at the beach.  Gets sand in it.  Wipes it off with a shoe.  Shoe scuffs the counter.
No, but there are four guys back there you might check out.
... Felony B and E, three months in juvey.  Better.  Felony assault. Postgraduate work at Chino. Excellent.  I'm lovin' it.  What about the brother?  Great!  Another model citizen. These guys really fit the profile.
When did Harp say they'd have the warrant?
I'm ready to rock, Angelo.  Where you want me?
Johnny!  Uh, you, uh... should call first, you know?  Hey, where the hell were you all day?  You gotta at least call in or something.  You okay?
... so I started tailing him.
I say we don't call it in.  Under no circumstance are we to call this in.
Time for lunch.
The hell are they?!
I can see that.  But forget it. Stick to tennis, or whatever you're good at.  Miniature golf.  Here, your number's 37.
Stop here.  Do you agree to do exactly what I say when I say it?
Nice place.
Oh, oh.  That sounds personal.
Meaning you were expendable.
Bunch of goddamn adrenaline junkies. I hope you're not buying into this banzai-bullshit like the rest of Bodhi's moonies.
I... I gotta go.
Hey!  Uh, how do I get back in?
I don't believe he did, Sir. I couldn't find a single track. Just doesn't make sense.
Blain...  ... Just like the others... no powder burns, no shrapnel.
He'll be looking for the trip wires. If we're lucky, he won't see this.
I'll see you there.
You saw what?
Put him in his poncho and liner and carry him back. We'll bury him in the morning.
I'm sorry, Bull. It's never easy. He was a good soldier.
You lift off in three hours.  There's one other thing.
How could anyone get through this, carry Blain out, right under our noses without leavin' a trace?
Mr. Harris, we know you've purchased at least twenty percent of our stock.  We also know you plan to file a formal bid for a majority share.
It's... it's not like that.
Congratulations, sir.
<u>Ho</u>tel.
So do day jobs.
My raincoat's in the back.  Put it on.
Send up a bottle of Crystal champagne.
And why do you say that?
It's a very good year.
You really are a very beautiful girl.
Did you sleep well?
Oooh, Baby, you were the best. I was beside myself.
Vivian --
I'm not just talking about sex.
Just one?  Christ... I hope it's appropriate.
Let's hope so.  You'll get some more clothes tomorrow.  I'll be pushed for time so meet me in the hotel lobby at seven forty-five sharp.  Got it?
Hello?
Was someone rude to you?
I thought maybe you'd like dinner.
Seems like it.  I guess it's easy to get used to, huh?
Keep talkin'.  I like hearin'.
What id we run into someone I know?
Clean the slut up, take her out, huh?!  What are you trying to prove!?  I'm not a piece of meat for you to offer to your friends!
Can we talk about this?  Can you just try to calm down?
You don't want to go all the way to San Francisco in a limousine, do you?  I don't.
Vivian, I've thought about this a lot.  This is the best solution.
What did you do to him?
I got tired of hating my father.
Aw, don't... no...
I have a message for you from your "niece", sir.
What time's diner tonight?
Doing what?
You're being ridiculous.
Oh, my god... Edward, no!
'Lo.
He... he just does.
Who did you think?
Want a pair of boots?
Housekeeping.  I come to turn down the bed.  5:00, I turn down the bed.
They will serve salad.
Barnard Thomas here.  Miss Vivian, I wonder if you might come down to the front desk.  There's someone here to see you.
Look I just wanted to say goodbye.
I didn't ask if it would fit. I asked how much it was.
Do you want to know what he did? Do you want to know what the crazy son of a bitch did?  He handed the whole thing back to Kross! On a silver platter.  For no reason!  What was he thinking, I mean, what was going through his goddam head?  Why?  What was all that benevolent crap?  What are we going to become, a philanthropic foundation?  I'll probably be the director of several worthwhile charities.
The Prince and the Count always insist on everyone being healthy before they're broken.
He is a sailor on the pirate ship "Revenge." Promise to return him to his ship.
Who are you?
I asked him what was so important for him. "True love," he replied. And then he spoke of a girl of surpassing beauty and faithfulness. I can only assume he meant you. You should bless me for destroying him before he found out what you really are.
Faithfulness he talked of, madam. Your enduring faithfulness. Now, tell me truly. When you found out he was gone, did you get engaged to your prince that same hour, or did you wait a whole week out of respect for the dead?
I told you, "I would always come for you." Why didn't you wait for me?
Death cannot stop true love. All it can do is delay it for a while.
This will all soon be but a happy memory because Roberts' ship "Revenge" is anchored at the far end. And I, as you know, am Roberts.
We did it.
I got married. I didn't want to. It all happened so fast.
What?
Well, no, we sort of skipped that part.
Why is that, do you think?
It's fabric from the uniform of an Army officer of Guilder.
You were supposed to be this colossus. You were this great, legendary thing. And yet he gains.
-- I do not accept excuses.  I'm just going to have to find myself a new giant, that's all.
Hello.
I don't think more than ten.
No -- not Vizzini -- I need the Man in Black --
-- look, he bested you with strength, your greatness. He bested me with steel. He must have outthought Vizzini, and a man who can do that can plan my castle's onslaught any day. Let's go --
Well, we Montoyas have never taken defeat easily. Come along, Fezzik. Bring the body.
Have you any money?
It doesn't sound too bad. I'll try and stay awake.
Oh no. No, please.
Skip on to the Fire Swamp -- that sounded good.
Who gets Humperdinck?
What? What?
As Chief Enforcer of all Florin, I trust you with this secret: killers from Guilder are infiltrating the Thieves' Forest and plan to murder my bride on our wedding night.
She will not be murdered. On the day of the wedding, I want the Thieves' Forest emptied and every inhabitant arrested.
Form a Brute Squad then. I want the Thieves' Forest emptied before I wed.
Rise and report.
Ah, but how will you capture us? We know the secrets of the Fire Swamp. We can live there quite happily for some time. So, whenever you feel like dying, feel free to visit.
A technicality that will shortly be remedied. But first things first. To the death.
-- and then my tongue, I suppose. I killed you too quickly the last time, a mistake I don't mean to duplicate tonight.
-- and then my ears, I understand. Let's get on with it
Your guess is as good as mine --
And it is guarded by sixty men.
Well, why didn't you list that among our assets in the first place? What I wouldn't give for a holocaust cloak.
Why? You can't even lift one.
Now?
Where's Fezzik?
-- anything you want --
We're really in a terrible rush.
I need him to help avenge my father, murdered these twenty years.
He's dead. He can't talk.
Thank you for everything.
I could do that. In fact, I've got some rope up here. But I do not think that you will accept my help, since I am only waiting around to kill you.
But I promise I will not kill you until you reach the top.
Well, I certainly hope you find him, someday.
You seem a decent fellow. I hate to kill you.
Go in, get after her!
Perhaps an arrangement can be reached.
But if there can be no arrangement, then we are at an impasse.
Inhale this, but do not touch.
What you do not smell is called iocane powder. It is odorless, tasteless, dissolves instantly in liquid, and is among the more deadlier poisons known to man.
Guess what.
"Honeymoon, honeymoon,
You have exactly ten seconds to change that disgusting look of pity into one of enormous respect.  One ... Two ...
Look at that.  A white Rolls Royce. That's it baby, when you got it, flaunt it.
Good, what is it?
You have forty-eight seconds left. Hurry.  Hurry.
What is that?  A handkerchief?
Help!
But the play only cost $60,000 to produce.
Mr. Bialystock.  No.  Wait.  Please. You're holding me too tight.  I'm an honest man.  You don't understand.
Will you get a hold on yourself.
What are you afraid of?  I'm not going to hurt you!  What's the matter with you?
Okay ... Max!  And you can call me Leo.
Mrs. Eleanor Biddlecombe.  She also owns 50% of the profits.
How do you do.  Have you gone mad?  A receptionist that can't speak English.  What will people say?
What is she gonna do here?
Max, as I was saying, maybe we should go easy on the spending.  I mean these offices and everything.
What are you doing with those books? Where are you going?
Here.  Buy bullets.  Kill.  Kill them all!
They are?  Have you ever eaten with one?  Liebkind, go!  Kill!
Max, I...
Well, I... Well, it's just that... I'm sorry I called you fat, fat, fat.
Vhy do you persecute me?  My papers are in order.  I love my country.  "Oh, beautiful for spacious skies, For amber vaves of grain."
"I'm a Yankee Doodle Dandy ...
I vas vit him a great deal, you know.
Oh, sure.  I used to take him his hot milk and his opium.  Achhh, those were the days.  Vat good times ve had.  Dinner parties vit lovely ladies and gentlemen, singing und dancing.  You know, not many people knew about it, but the Fuhrer vas a terrific dancer.
Not good enough... Vould you be villing to take the Siegfried oath?
Franz, trust me.  I promise I won't let you down.
Always.
You, Blum go Motel.
Get car.  Get car.
Rudolfo, you dirty pig!  Pull over.
Until Thursday, then, you bawdy wench.
Thursday.  I'll see you Thursday.
Good.  Yes.  Thursday.
Of Siegfried...
Nietzche...
Hindenburg...
Heil you know who!
Six months, I'm out on probation, but it's cool now, baby.
He's the only cat left that still grooves me.
Oh. I thought... you said you'd been to so many in two days...  What was it you wanted to ask?
Mind looking at the picture before committing yourself?
No. At least I don't recall.
The following morning. Sunday.
No.
Cash.
I live there. Alone.
Now, look...!
No. I told you, she's confined...
I don't know.
You came up here on a hunch, Miss Crane? Nothing more? No phone call... from him, or from your sister herself?
Go ahead! Spin it around the block. Now I know you don't know anything about engine condition, but you can feel, can't you... and it's all in the feel, believe me, you feel that one around the block...
I take it... you can prove that car's yours... I mean, out of state and all... got your pink slip and your...
I think you'd better give it a trial spin. Don't want any bad word of mouth about California Charlie.
It'll pass. Headaches are like resolutions... you forget them soon as they stop hurting.
No, Mr. Lowery... but then she's always a bit late on Monday mornings.
You better run out to the house. She may be... unable to answer the phone...
She left Phoenix a week ago yesterday. And no trace until...
Forty thousand dollars.
He didn't mention the money.  What he said on the phone isn't important, is it?  He was supposed to come back after he spoke to the mother, and he didn't! That's what I want you to do something about!
Go out there! Find somebody, ask some questions!  I'm sorry if I seem over-anxious to you. I keep thinking... something's wrong. I have to know what!
Yes.
Yes?
What thing could we be in together?
Well why didn't she come to me... call me...?
I ought to call the police right now!
You want me to stay here?
I feel better when you feel better.
Got the number of the motel out on the old highway? Bates, I think. 
Stay here.
Yes.
I wonder so many things about her now.  Why she never told me about you...  Funny, when you think there's an answer to everything, you think you know all the answers.
I suppose... when you were able to marry her she'd have presented you, all shiny and proper... she always tried to be proper.
You going to wait here for me?
What is it?
I've heard of married couples who deliberately spend occasional nights in cheap hotels. They say it...
You can't laugh at it, huh?
Not even just to see you, to have lunch... in public?
And after the steak... do we send Sister to the movies and turn Mama's picture to the wall?
Yeah, but when you do... you'll swing.
I've caused you some trouble.
A man should have a hobby.
Only my share.
I'm looking for a private island.
Sometimes we deliberately step into those traps.
No, not like me.
I've suggested it myself. But I hate to even think such a thing.  She needs me... and it isn't...  ...it isn't as if she were a maniac, a raving thing... it's just that... sometimes she goes a little mad. We all go a little mad sometimes. Haven't you?
You're not going to... to your room already?
Why don't you stay a little while, just for talking.
You mean that old woman I saw sittin' in the window wasn't Norman Bates' mother?
Recluse. Kinder word.
Norman? Sheriff Chambers.  Been just fine, thanks. Listen, we got some worries here. Did you have a man stop out there tonight...  Well, this one wouldn't be a customer, anyway. A private detective, name of...
I helped Norman pick out the dress she was buried in. Periwinkle blue.
It isn't necessary.
Looking for me?
Satisfied with your cabin?
My mother is not dead!
Where will you get the money to do that, Bates... or do you already have it... socked away... a lot of it...
Mother, she's just a stranger!  As if men don't desire strangers, as if... oh, I refuse to speak of disgusting things because they disgust me! You understand, Boy?
Was that all?
You didn't even mention the suicides. Did you notice the beaut that came in today?
Did you wish to see someone?
He's inherited a fortune.
It may be, but to my notion, those that monkeys with what they got no business to get queer sooner or later.
What' s the idea [of wanting so many] do you sell them [to the doctor]?
By the way, where <U>is</U> your assistant?
What is it now?
What were you dreaming about?
The child!
There's no child here.
There's no child here, and no dogs either.
The blood transfusion continues. Marc has positioned himself outside the circle of light from the lamp, so that he can see Nikolas in bright light, while he himself sits in the dark. Nikolas watches Lone's face anxiously and closely during her struggle with death. Life slowly seems to return to her, and her breathing becomes more peaceful. She opens her eyes and looks at the people round her, but she is much too enfeebled to speak, and closes her eyes again. Marc keeps a close watch on Nikolas, who grows paler and paler. His eyes swivel slowly from Nikolas to the patient and back to Nikolas again.
You lie!
I don't have any affairs. What do you mean?
You wouldn't get mixed up with that little rotter, would you?
Why, certainly, sir. My fiance. Charlotte, may I present Mr. Igor.
You wouldn't have said that before you met her.
Well, that's just how stupid I am. When you go riding, it will be with me. And if it's with someone else, you can make it a permanent arrangement.
Although you would be amused if I were to tell you that I knew you before you were born. Before this terrible thing happened to me ...  ... I made a very beautiful statue. Even if I had not met with this disaster, I could never have hoped to do anything finer, probably nothing quite so fine. And, my child, you are that figure come to life. I wonder, some time, would you pose for one of my sculptors who does very excellent work?
But I think these things are beautiful.
Oh, please, Mr. Igor, I'm terribly ashamed. I shouldn't have put you to so much trouble.
Let me go! Let me go!
Hello, Express. What's the idea, trying to outsmart the police?
Where did you get the news item?  From a little bird?
Meaning what?
And how does one go about getting these human documents, may I inquire?
You don't think he'd be sap enough to do the job himself. I hope they give him the works. Even if he didn't kill the kid, he's responsible for her death, and they can fry him any time without making me sore.
Oh, you won't -- you were pretty tough about Judge Ramsey -- a little while ago --
Whooey -- he took a run-out powder.
Well, why so mysterious! Come on, spill it.
I am right! I know I'm right!
Just this -- I got a look at that dump a little while ago and if they haven't got a wax figure of Joan Gale in that line-up, then I'm crazy.
What do you mean?
This one's a story, but I'm not going to tell you what it is. Every time I tell you anything it goes haywire.
That's what I said.
Yes, sir. I got in the cab and it was layin' there on the floor.
I don't remember. Not so very far--
I've got a story for you. You know the Joan Gale girl?
Don't give this to anybody else, will you?
Listen, Flo, cut it out. Hard-Tack is pretty sore.
That's what I said.
Hmmm. Why didn't you tell that to the police?
Uh-huh. Do you remember what she said? What did you talk about?
It doesn't usually take that long, but I'll forgive you -- you were in a tough spot when I met you.
Oh, is that what caused it?
What is it? What happened?
You are too gracious. These things have some merit, I suspect ... but this--  ... I am convinced, is fine. 
My partner believes that I should build a horror chamber, immortalizing the hideous crimes and criminals of London. At such times Marie Antoinette has reassured me, she has promised me recognition for the devotion I gave to her.
Your money may have been well invested, my friend. Something important may come of all this.
Is that a fact?
Well, what do you think I'm in this for?  Think of it, man, a match -- a cigar stub -- and ten thousand pounds to divide between us!
She is the soul of that statue.
I'm glad they didn't hold you downtown.
Don't waste it Pauly.  This is not an everyday talk.  Just input the information and ask relevant questions.  One: how did a celebrated life of the mind bring me  to this particular switching station?
Mia...?
A place you've never been.
Of what?
I've been dreaming about this.
Why?
She isn't here. And I'm sorry, but Mr. Hillyer doesn't want her to have callers during working hours.
They're filthy, Mother.
Oh, Mother, not the castor oil.
Was that what they tried to do? Was that why Daddy gave you the job, to save you from those scoundrels?
It's so terrible I can't tell you. Oh, Buddy, you don't know how it hurts to have a broken heart, what a terrible feeling it is, and I've had a broken heart so many times. Men, I don't understand them, I can't figure them out and they break my heart, that's all. I can't find Mr. Right, Buddy, I can't find him no matter how hard I look, all I find is a whole pile of Mr. Wrongs. But this is the worst ever because it wasn't his fault. It was my fault, oh yes, my fault, I was bad -- oh God, I was bad, you wouldn't believe how bad I was.
Promise not to tell Doll? -- or nobody? Buddy, it's your Daddy! I'm so much in love with him I am out of my mind!
There's some kind of gristle in it, though.
Just for a second. Please, Rose, what's the harm?
'Course it does.
All right, that's enough.  You're just a child and wouldn't understand it, but that type of thing can stir a girl up. Now lie back and we'll talk.
Don't mention it.
Why, Buddy, shut your mouth! What an awful thing to say, and where did you get any such idea as that, anyhow?
No! You ought to be ashamed of yourself astin' such a nasty things a child your age!
You better quit that.
Rose, are you all right? Are you sick or something?
Rose, they could stick splinters under my fingernails, and I will never say a word! I will never tell them, because... I love you!
I got an awful toothache.
I guess I'll work as a waitress, Buddy. I done that before and it got me in worse trouble than you could know, but I can't stay here no more. Why did you get rid of your rabbits, Buddy?
I do, too!
You were up late last night, Brother.
Is that Doctor still up there, Brother.
Your impression is very reassuring, Brother. Of course she's had troubles, poor thing, but I sensed that was that the girl was like and I'm glad to have it reconfirmed.
All right, all right. Doll and Waski are upstairs taking their nap, you go get them and bring them down to the living room. Where is the girl?
Let's go peep from the living room.
He had his hand on her titty.
It isn't that she hasn't got any sense, Doll. Her basic intelligence is probably above average, maybe quite a bit above average.
The pitiful son of a bitch said Rose was a nymphomaniac.
All right, Daddy. We have our drink, we're out on the patio, you have prepared me for it. Rose's cancer has come back, hasn't it?
Dead, Rose is dead? You mean... she died?
But... but how? She was young! Rose wasn't old!
Go ahead, Doctor, I think I am following you.
Please do.
Of course.
I asked you what you think of Rosebud, now that she's been here a while.
Um-hmm. Almost too perfect.
Well, I'll admit I don't see any flies on her yet.
All right, darlin', don't go off into the fourth dimension.
Well, I admit that outfit isn't very modest. But she doesn't mean any harm, she just wants to attract, attention.
Be kind to her. She loves you so much.  In a perfectly proper way, of course.
Oh, shut up, Rose. Shut your mouth and quit crying!
I am not being brutal to her!
Now you listen to me, Rose --
I don't intend to fire her, darlin'.
I said I don't intend to fire her. I just want to ask her to keep her boy friends away from my home and hearth, that's all.
That is exactly what I'm afraid of.  The girl has got to go, darlin'.
Excuse me, sir, are you calling my wife a liar?
Honey, Rose was born on a farm and has terrible memories of farm life. Now I don't think --
I don't know how you can call it ideal -- don't you know what the word "farm" means to her?
This is a total catastrastroke. As of this moment I am stumped, I admit, I am stumped and treed both, the hound dogs have me surrounded.
Rose isn't oversexed, that's ridiculous. If you're going to talk nonsense, I don't want to talk to you at all. Rose is exactly the same as the rest of us, except more so.
How is she?
Rosebird Baby, you are the light of my life, darlin'. How did we ever get by without you?
How can the buttons stand the pressure?
You were up late last night, too, Rose.
You don't know where you're going?
Well, Rose, my sleep was a little disturbed last night, and so was Mrs. Hillyer's, and so was the children's. How about you? Was your sleep disturbed, too?
Strange voices, Rose?
Darlin', I'll take a taxi to the hotel. You and Brother can handle the girl's epizootics. I'll just say one more thing.  Rose, I told you you had a friend in Mrs. Hillyer, didn't I, that she would fight for you like a tiger?
I got an awful bad cold.
I didn't mean to bite him. He was hitting Horton with a blackjack in the meanest way and... and I bit him accidental.
I didn't mean to bite him, I really didn't.
And what, may I ask, was Billy doing here?
Yes, Tennessee, a lovely state!
Yes, I am.
Galley what?
She didn't marry him, though, later she married another guy and went to Winston-Salem. It didn't last That girl couldn't have no lastin' marriage, she left him and married another dumb sucker and went out west. Little bitch left him, too, and you know what she's married to right now?  A kike. That's right, some kind of kike horse doctor named Schapiro out in Seattle, who's got the nerve to have the same first name I got. Wouldn't you know it, Rose would wind up married to a goddamn kike? She was always out of her friggin' head and I'll tell you why.  Buddy, she was sick in her mind and between her legs, too. She was a nymphomaniac.
I don't want to start no fight with you, Buddy. Why do you say I'm full of shit?
She used to call me Mr. Right. Remember that, Buddy?
Ah-h, if you happen to run into Rose sometime... do me a favor, give her a message for me, will you?
I don't like that, either, it's worse than Waski. I want to be called Fran.
What's the matter with him?
Of course she does and I must say I'm puzzled by your delay in getting her to the hospital. I should think ordinary powers of observation would have suggested to you that she was seriously ill.
Well, she has one mouth in ten thousand, I don't see teeth like that once in ten years. Her trouble is an impacted wisdom tooth, but there isn't a cavity in her head, not a single one. She has perfect teeth.
Rose, this is Waski. His real name is Warren but we call him Waski. He doesn't like it much and I suppose someday we'll have to stop calling him that.
What are you studying now, Mrs. Hillyer?
Really, why don't you go sit down somewhere?
Rose, you're in an awful dither tonight. What's the matter with you, honey, are you sick or something?
Rose, that scruffy-looking man is out in the yard again.
I don't want to go to the dentist.
I'm not goin' in there, I don't like the looks of it!
Rose, you don't look well and you haven't eaten a bit of breakfast.
Well, I... I... I don't know... maybe it was... but no, you can't be sure about a thing like that. It wasn't Billy, I didn't know him.
Let me tell him.  Let him decide.
What Eve and I wouldn't give to meet up with you on the business end of a daisy chain.
How much?
Have I ever steered you wrong?
Take her down to the car, and for Christ's sake be careful this time.  Last suspect he took in, butter-fingers dropped her down the stairs.  What a mess.  Why is it we don't appreciate our arms and legs till we've lost the use of them?
Come on, don't you screw with her, please!  You... you got to want this: armored car job.  CalTrust Bank. They took two million in cash...
You're Zimmermann's calculator, Archie.  All the blood money you had to move around to make this deal, you got to know something.  Maybe they told you, maybe you overheard things you weren't supposed to hear...
Hey now... what the fuck... ?
Sons of bitches!
We should slow down.
We shoulda been there to back you up. We shoulda!
That's sick.
When you planning to cut back on that?
Dean Martin.
Laugh it up.  You'll cry later.
Where we going?
Bad news is, word's spreading like wildfire that we don't have badges, and nobody wants to end up getting splattered like Butch Cassidy either.
You plan on shooting that gun or just hugging it?
General Jim Beam, then.
I'm gonna put a great big, ear-to-fucking-ear smile on your face.  How 'bout that?
Our resignations.
What can we do for you, officers? What new, mindless harassments have you planned this morning?
Thanks, but we don't recognize "brunch" as an actual meal.
Your poison's not gonna make it into the veins of any kids this time.
Pardon me... my mistake.  Taking your thoughts in hand, huh... ?
Arriving tonight
I just think you should show some respect.  I mean, call me old fashioned, but 200 years ago when Ben Franklin and those guys signed the Constitution and Declaration of Independence, they did that so we could all share in the freedom...
You... SUCK!  You almost got us all killed!
Let's get this thing done.
Come again... ?
Get his attention.
You're... you're not doing what I think you're doing... ?
Why the beach?
Oh, yeah... the explosion.
I don't think so.
We saw it. All craft prepare to retreat.
You told me Vader betrayed and murdered my father.
I tried to stop him once. I couldn't do it.
But you can't let her get involved now, Ben. Vader will destroy her.
Are you all right?
Right. Chewie, let's see what this piece of junk can do. Ready, everybody?
Take the squad ahead.  We'll meet at the shield generator at 0300.
Hey!
I don't know. All I can see is a lot of blowing sand!
Yes.
Chewie! Chewie, give me the gun. Don't move, Lando.
Guess I owe you some thanks, too, Lando.
We're coming!
I tell you, this station will be operational as planned.
Good shot, Red Two.
Oh! Oh, my. Uh, Princess Leia!
Leia... do you remember your mother? Your real mother?
No, you don't. You've always been strong.
Master Yoda, you can't die.
Yoda, I must know.
Ah, good. New acquisitions. You are a protocol droid, are you not?
Yes or no will do.
You!
You tricked me.  I wouldn't have - I've never - never.
Janet!
So please don't tell me to can it.
Oh Brad, I'm mad.
I think we took the wrong fork a few miles back.
Oh, Brad.  Let's go back.  I'm cold and I'm frightened.
But it seems so unhealthy here.
Well I want to leave.
Then ask the butler - or someone.
Brad - I'm cold, I'm wet, and plain scared.
I could see Brad's face before me and my mind screamed No!  But my lips were hungry - too hungry.
Good God.
You're OK by me.
You beast, you monster, what have you done with Brad?
Ssssh.  Brad's probably asleep by now. Do you want him to see you like this?
"Sweet Transvestite"
Sha la la la That ain't no crime. That ain't no crime.
I think you had better both come inside.
The Master is not yet married.  Nor do I think he ever will be.  We are simply his servants.
Me, I'm kinda aggravated.
I smack 'em hard on the shell an' they get... What?
Y'know how I got started in the fight racket?
Some people think bein' shy is a disease, but it don't bother me.
Ya gotta be a little soft to wanna be a pug... It's a racket where ya' almost guaranteed to end up a bum.
...Guess.
Would ya like a glass of water?
Here's the guys I was tellin' ya about -- This is Cuff an' Link.
D'you really wanna call?
It's all right -- You're my guest.
Don't you open them anymore?
Can't fool around -- You look very great.
I thought it might be cute.
...And he called the reporters --
...I can't beat him.
...I dunno.
Oh, Rocky!
Einstein flunked out of school... twice.
Shutup! I want nothin' -- I ain't no charity case! Get outta my house!
...Paulie. Stop now!
Don't do that again!
No doctor!
Don't kill yourself, man -- Let the doctor stop the fight.
How was the flight, Champ?
Me an' my wife are goin' home 'cause we miss our children an' can't go no more time without seein' them.
Did ya get the license number?
Hey, the rink is empty 'cause we're closed -- ya ain't allowed in here so do me a favor an' not stay here.
Ten minutes for ten dollars.
Seven minutes!
...How 'bout for the Cokes?
You could go deaf with the noise -- it undoubtedly means Champion Apollo Creed is heading towards the ring --
Without a doubt this is the most punishing brawl I have ever seen -- The ringside audience is spotted with blood. This fight should have been stopped rounds ago but Rocky Balboa refuses to fall --
Yo' yellow, old man.
Don't hit the face! Not the face!!
That's it? -- Completely?
What about for food an' stuff?
Yo Rock. Did I give you a job this mornin? How come ya didn't break this guy's thumb like I asked ya? When ya don't do what ya are told, it makes me look bad, kid.
Y'know I won't be able to work for ya no more.
Sure, you do what ya want. Stay away from the stock market.
Rocky, do you have any representation? A manager?
What?
Makes your breath like garbage.
'Cause that's the way guys are -- They laugh when ya talk dirty. They think ya cute for a while, but then ya getta reputation an' watch out. Nobody's ever gonna take ya serious. Ya get no respect... I gotta use a bad word -- Whore. You'll end up maybe becomin' a whore.
What was I gonna say?
Goodnight, Rocky.
Dipper's a climber -- You're a tomato.
Hey, ever think about retirin'?
'Bout an hour ago.
Listen, Rock, you're a very lucky guy.
...What?
Really think so?
God bless ya, Rock.
How you holdin' up, kid?
Wanna keep goin'?
Yo, Mike -- What's happenin' here?
Hey, Rock -- What happened?
Yo, Paulie.
Ya always in a bad mood --
An' you're dyin' alone, too.
I'm askin' ya to go to him -- As a favor.
!! Ya want the bird, go out in the alley an' eat the bird -- I want ya outta the house -- Enjoy ya friggin' life... Ya hungry, Rock?
I got whiskey here.
Ya really like her?
...I can't haul meat no more.
Yeah, I had to go slummin'.  See, a friend of mine's bein' framed.
Don't worry about me.  I can take it.
He's a riot.
So what's the scam, Eddie?
Maybe they just took it out of his pocket.
What was <u>that</u>?
What's that comin' from the bar?
Being caught breaking and entering is not very good advertising for a detective.  What were you looking for, Mr. Valiant?
Come on, Doom.  What would a company like that want with Toontown?
You're a pig... a happy-go-lucky pig.
Does it hurt?
Oh, sure.  I can just feature you standin' outside your little hutch, holdin' a carrot cake waitin' for hubby to come home.
You shot Roger.
I didn't know who I could trust.
How did you get onto Doom?
Tell me you didn't do a snoop job for a Toon named Roger the Rabbit.
Now what?
How much do you know about show business, Valiant?
Son-of-a-bitch...  Mr. Maroon, I think I'll be goin' now, so about the rest of my fee...
You got the will in there, don't ya?
Does this help?
Are you always this funny, or only on days when you're wanted for murder?
Hey, don't I get an encore?
Here you go, kid... say hi to Casper for me.
Oh, Eddie, that was quick thinkin'. Nothin' like usin' the old noggin, the noodle, the grey matter...
Valiant and Valiant?  Who's the other Valiant?
So what's our plan, our scenario, our modus operandi?
You wanna know?  Well, since you're so goddamn curious, I'll tell ya.  One of you Toons killed my brother.
You know, Eddie, I'm not as much of a chump, and a patsy, a yokel as you think.
If I don't make it back here by ten...
Say Roger, remember that love letter you wrote your wife at the Ink & Paint Club?
I think you oughta read it to her.
By the way, Roger, you were right about your wife.  She's a good lady.  I'm glad you got her back.
Quarrel sir! no, sir.
Have patience!
Live and be prosperous; and farewell good fellow.
Any man that can write may answer a letter.
More than prince of cats. He is the courageous captain of compliments. He fights as you sing prick- song, keeps time, distance, and proportion; he rests his minim rest, one, two, and the third in your bosom: the very butcher of a silk button, a duellist, a duellist; a gentleman of the very first house, of the first and second cause: the immortal passado! punto reverso! the hai!
Ay me! Sad hours seem long. Was that my father that went hence so fast?
Alas, that love, whose view is muffled still, Should, without eyes, see pathways to his will! Where shall we dine? O me! What fray was here? Yet tell me not, for I have heard it all. Here's much to do with hate, but more with love. Why, then, O brawling love! O loving hate! O any thing, of nothing first create! O heavy lightness! Serious vanity! Misshapen chaos of well-seeming forms! Feather of lead-- [Benvolio Snickers] Dost thou not laugh?
Good heart, at what?
Farewell, my cuz.
This wind, you talk of, blows us from ourselves; Supper is done, and we shall come too late.
I'll not endure him.
It strains me past the compass of my wits.
Good marrow, father!
Young son, it argues a distemper'd head so soon to bid good marrow to thy bed: or if not so so, then here I hit it right, our Romeo hath not seen his bed tonight.
O, she new well. Thy love read by rote and could not spell. Come, young waverer, come, go with me, In one respect I'll thy assistant be; for this alliance may so happy prove, to turn you household rachor to pure love.
Banishment? Be merciful, say death; for exile hath more terror in his look much more than death. Do not say Banishment.
I come for my lady Juliet.
O sweet my mother cast me not away. Delay this marriage for a month, a week. Or if you do not make the bridal bed in that dim  monument where Tybalt lies.
Saints do not move, though grant for prayers' sake.
Art thou not Romeo and a Montague?
Thou know'st the mask of night is on my face, Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek For that which thou hast heard me speak to-night Fain would I dwell on form, fain, fain deny What I have spoke: but farewell compliment! Dost thou love me? I know thou wilt say 'Ay,' And I will take thy word: yet if thou swear'st, Thou mayst prove false. O gentle Romeo, If thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully:
O, swear not by the moon, the inconstant moon, That monthly changes in her circled orb, Lest that thy love prove likewise variable.
What satisfaction canst thou have to-night?
That light is not daylight, I know it, I. It is some meteor that the sun exhales to light thee on thy way to Mantua. Therefore stay yet. Thou needest not be gone.
Nurse, give leave awhile, We must talk in secret. Nurse, come back again; I have remember'd me, thou's hear our counsel. Nurse, Thou know'st my daughter's of a pretty age.
Go! We follow thee. Juliet, Blah!
Why, may one ask?
And so did I.
That dreamers often lie.
A most courteous exposition.
I will follow you.
'Twill serve. Ask for me tomorrow and you shall find me a grave man. A plague o' both your houses. They have made worms meat of me. A plague on both your Houses! Why the devil did you come between us? I was hurt under your arm.
Good king of cat's, nothing but one of your nine lives.
Nurse.
While Sam and I take out the back two cars...
Of course.
I don't know.
Only the stupid ones.  Cigarettes kill more patriots than bullets.  Besides, I'm not IRA no more.
I don't know.  I was thinking...Maybe the three of us might partner up -- guns for hire, that sort of thing.
So what's the deal?
You call me with the target's route, I follow along until we've reached the attack point and then I run his squag ass off the road.
Best beer in the world?  Budweiser for me, thanks.
And what's that supposed to mean, Seamus Reilly?
From Interpol?
Lose them!
You're thinking with your gun, Seamus, and not your head...
I better be getting that.
Because if they had she'd be gone along with the package, instead of sitting here with us.
Well, if it isn't Mr. Interpol himself.  I can't believe I misjudged you like I did.
Are you alright?
Not me.  You work too often with the same people and you become friends -- clouds your judgement.
It's quite satifactory.
Go ahead, shoot... Shoot and kill the bitch, I don't care.  And yet you don't shoot.  Interesting. Put down your weapon and walk away.
What do you mean?
Here's yours.
We'll die if we stay here!
If you're lying to me you poor excuse for a human being, I'm gonna blow your brains all over this car.
This better be the real thing or you're a dead man!
What am I doing here?  Why, I'm here to see my partners, Gregor, the boys in the Russian Mafia.  See, your bosses had hoped to screw me by hiring you to pull your thieving double cross.  But they only just found out that what's in the briefcase is completely useless without me.  I can't fight them, and they can't kill me -- that means we're gonna have to do business together.
Whoever hired us.
So none of us knows who's paying the freight, this is just some anonymous job. For all we know, we're working for different people.
I need you, Swede, I can't do this without you!
Hello, Jean-Pierre.
And you respect him.
Soon.
Created?
All in the stomach, though.  Your man might live.
I ride with fat-boy...
After we stop the target car I get out and use the heavy artillery to kill the driver and his bodyguard.
Pretty much what you'd expect.
A cigarette?  As in one?  One cigarette a week, who smokes like that?
You know, what you pulled back there, that was bullshit.
That there was a gun pointed at me.
I've seen a lot of people die before.
No...I thought I'd take you to the hospital.
You sure your friend got the right place?
I'm a field agent -- last of an already extinct breed.  I do dark ops.
It is at that.
You would have done that?
Gimme a goddamn cigarette!!!!
In a minute.
Do we need anything else?
It's the one thing I've got left to hold onto.  Jean-Pierre is one of your closest friends, is he not?
That's a good question.
"Your field dressing saved his life." That's three I owe you.
What happened to it?
It's the Irish tape we want.
Last I heard there was a film rep for the Irish players staying at this address, name of Seamus Reilly.
You slept with her!
Doing well.  This is?
What I've heard so far, it's all a lot of talk.  I wasn't so sure what to make of it at first, cause, like I said, the Irish and the Russians are an unlikely mix.
Can you get it?
Seamus Reilly, boy's a serious Irish Auteur -- a real firebrand.  Thinks his more moderate filmmaking brethren have turned to making movies for peace-loving pussies, if you see what I'm saying.
Tony and I have to talk some business, first.
Sort of!
Damn.
I should kill you right here! I never thought you'd do this to me but I guess there's a lot I didn't know about you!
I would have asked my sister, but its better to leave family out, always leads to trouble.
He would have won more but he blew it at the end.  Didn't know what Cash and Carry was.
Oh, you would have done great.
What are we going to do?
We don't know whose money it is!  They might have robbed a bank, who knows?
It won't work.
I don't know!  Son of a bitch! Who the hell are you?
How long you been lying there playing possum with us, huh? Answer me!
I'm not letting some gangbanger send me to jail.  We can't risk it.
Okay then.  I'll do it.
No we didn't.  He died on his own.
How long you been lying there playing possum with us, huh? Answer me!
Shit!  We're gonna have to get rid of him.  I'm not letting some gangbanger ruin my life.  We can't risk it.
And how do you figure we do that?
You're out of your mind.
You think he's bluffing?
Maybe we can reason with Jesse, give him a third in exchange for the tape.
How long is it going to take?!
Here it is.
Booth, listen to me...Booth!
It's too late...
Listen Earl.  I covered for you. For both of you.  I put my ass on the line to save yours, so don't pull a hostile tone with me!
Besides, I'm not stupid, Earl. The tape was a basic Maxell D-80.  You can buy 'em at any store.  There's no way they can pin anything on me.
I'm all ears.
How are ya?
Could it have been in the Mercedes?
Yeah?  So?
There's an ATM on Speedwell Avenue.
Well, not that I wouldn't sugar bun but Earl's in a bind.  They're going to take his car.
Nothing's wrong.
That son of a bitch.
Every night I think about you sleeping with him, him slobbering all over you.
We'd... I don't know...go to California, New York, maybe a house on a Swiss mountainside...
Be more specific.  A month, a week...
Test the product?
What is this?  Don't be stupid man...
What makes you say that?
I don't know.
He kept a recording of all such transactions in order to keep track of who's who, what was said, what's happening.  I contacted your local coroner, and he found it taped to his back.
Yeah.  I told him I'd be there before five.
Uh, no...
Don't you have to be here?
Mr. Curtis called us this afternoon. The bills arrived at this branch from a cash drop.  Came through a store called After Midnight.  There's only four employees, none of them can tell us who passed them.
Some of it.  Denning only handled a small portion of the total, but it looks like this was one of his bills.
Yeah.
Sixty five...  Jeez Louise!
Yeah, she is.  She comes up to about here on me.
Do you know...34 C?  32 C?
A lot of men come in here?
Damn its hot in here...
No.  But what I would like is the forty dollars you owe me, and Im a busy man.
Jesse?
Why?
Nice of you to join us.  I did say three o'clock, didn't I?
Something wrong, Jesse?
I didn't know you were coming.
How's work?
Did they ever find out who they were?
I tell you this world just keeps getting more and more violent.
Not in the trunk.
Yeah, we did.  It was unleaded, high octane.
Yeah.
Winner six!
Winner!  Four, winner!
So tell me what you know.
I'm an undercover agent for the United States Secret Service.
How're they getting into the U.S. Mint to use the presses?
I'm busy at the moment.
Would you like me to tell you how your father died?
You bring American money?
You get massage from Chinese girl before?
This is a gangster bar, we're here undercover.
I'm sorry.
No.  You are a civilian.  In China, I am Michael Jackson, and you are Toto.
And that's how you use the LAPD choke hold.  Now start practicing and don't make me come back here!
What are you doing?
Not Yu.  You!
Give me your best shot, you flat assed mama's boy.
I thought you'd think it was crazy.
Follow the RichWhiteMan...
Maybe.  But not like Asians.  We never panic.
He'll be back soon.
The truth is, I haven't had any mu-shu in six months.
I'm not used to having a partner.
See you in the next world.
Fine.
How was the sex?
Steamed dumplings?
Red Dragon.
Carter...here comes the rich white man.
That your gate down there?
I'm this way.  I guess this is goodbye.
No, Carter.  I can't take this.
A little Mu-shu.
I don't know if the Fu-Cang-Long paid you to get rid of Tan, or whether it was a pure vendetta killing -- but you're off this case.  I don't ever want to see you again, you got that?
Behind me is the soft count room.  We're pretty sure the plates are back there.
The Secret Service almost busted Reign at his casino in Macao, but the place burned down before we could move in.
I'm asking for real now -- will you help the Secret Service?
Are you okay?
We think it's Ricky Tan.  If you don't want to take the case, I'll understand.
You know what a phone booth is?!
Fifty million!  Are we talkin' United States dollars?
He was just doing his job.
Bullshit a little.  You lied to me.
-- what the hell is that?
Where were we?
Right....
Shortcut?
I worked with Ambassador Han and his family for ten years.  He wanted me to come with them to America.  If I had, this might not have happened.
I also did not come because I think I would not fit in America.
Let's get us a photo and description. We'll have an APB out while we stake out the restaurant.
Are you tellin' me nobody knows what he looks like?  Come on, there must be witnesses somewhere.
That's not how it goes.
No, no.  It's not good-God you all! It's Good-God, ya'll.  Ya'll!
Not yee-aw, Ya'll.  And it's gotta be angry.  Like you're pissed off.
Are you OK?
Excuse me?
Which one?
This is my territory now.  You are my responsibility.
No, wait.  I don't have it.  You have it.
Oh no.
No, it is China, my country, my history.  If any of it gets damaged...
What a surprise!
Oh, you're not gonna believe what they put me in charge of.  They sent for the Ambassador's personal Chinese Investigator type.  He is like the baddest Asian shield they got.  And I, let me repeat that, I am the man who is on the case with him.  Just the two of us, alone, workin' the whole deal as a team.
Oh baby, don't worry, I'll call you. You can count on it.
Well.. I wouldn't want to be in the way.
You got a lot of guts calling me.
Yeah, if you're Superfly.
You don't like it?
I'm talking about the girl.
What kind of assignment is that?
Hmmmm?
Okay, look, we're gonna make a trade. You cross the street, leave her on the sidewalk.  I will leave him on this side.  Then we trade places.  You get him, I get her.  Get the picture, Lois?
You're movin' to death row. See, your fingerprints are now on the murder weapon of Four FBI Agents. And when I turn this into the lab, they're gonna find Lafontaine all over it. And we already know...  ...this is your MO.
You sonuvabitch.
I am not an American, Mr. Russ.  My daughter is not an American.
Come on. Let's get you some dry clothes.
I don't believe you.  My father was explaining to Mr. Griffin.  That is how I found out.
I will not have friends in America.
And in a "V".
See?  You want custody of my job? ... Why not just consider my wrist slapped and call me when you feel I've served my time?
Ellie asked me to come down to offer moral support.
Ike, I really liked the Runaway Bride piece, and since I do freelance stuff for G.Q., I'm in a different position now...
Yeah.
Okay, we'll order out.
I'm not sure.  Mr. Schullian runs the newsstand, he's our local bookie, you know, he's giving eight to one odds she won't.  He says she's so famous now, maybe Vegas will give odds on her.  I'm going to wait to hear what the pros say.
Have you listened to his morning show, "Wake up with ballplayer"?
Oh, Betty.  I take it you're going to be making the wedding cake and they say you're throwing --
They made me put my hat back on.
Dad's fishing trip, Grandma's knee operation, Grandma's birthday...
I hope you have a different angle. It's pretty much all been covered.
Weird dreams?  You're going to tell me about them?
That's fair.
How romantic.
Too much.
I don't know.
No.
I'll have the same.
Oh, my God -- It's Miles Davis.  This is "King of Blue"!  This is the original recording.  Hard to find in good condition.  Where did you find this?
First I have to find some tools.  I need a half and a nine-six-tenth.
Brian told you that?
What!?
I'm sorry, Bob.  She kissed me back.
Okay.  So... what, uh... What just happened?  Just now?  Jus then?  In there?
To who?  Are you asking me?
Yes, you!
You actually could make breaking and entering into a new career.  So, what are you doing here?
Yes, I did.
You were not.
I'm listening.
Pretty good speech, Maggie.
So -- Mag -- you've seen this, huh?
Hold on -- Nobody interviews Maggie in here unless they're getting haircut.
There he is.  Snoop Doggy-Dogg.
I'm going to kill myself.
Because you think I'm all like... "Hey man, check me out".
Something that brings warmth to my heart.  Duckbill platypus.
You're right.  It's not funny now. Maybe we both grew up.
Grandma!
You and your lucky geese.  You always see geese.
Want to go to Butch's for a drink or something?
I'm not exactly having fun, either... Steady.
I'm really rooting for this one.
"What is unusual about Miss Carpenter is that she likes to dress her men up as grooms before she devours them.  She has already disemboweled six in a row by leaving them at the altar."... I can't ready anymore.
No, no.  You're her best friend.
You know, it's just possible that she hasn't read this yet.
You take the microwave?
Boats.  You go out in them. You come back in them.  I hate them.
But it's on the water.
If he eats one tiny piece of a nut --
I love you, Walter.  Did anyone ever call you anything other than Walter?
I'll wait.
Couldn't you just do a phone interview?
You should write something about this.
What's with you?
And this woman is a writer! That's what everyone writes at the beginning of letters to strangers.
Right.
Men never get this movie.
You told a lie and got on a plane.
You were standing in the middle of the street?
I love that dream.
But he saw you, right?
It's a sign --
You're going to miss the train.
No, I know that part --
I'm Jonah.  That's my dad.  His name is Sam.
I think I'm going crazy, Tom. I really do.  Are you happily married?
Everybody! Annie has an announcement --
The Historical Society wanted this and I never would give it to them --
You know.
I knew we would be together forever, and that everything would be wonderful, just the way you feel about Walter. Walter.  It's quite a formal name, isn't it?  One of the things I truly knew was that your father and I were going to have a wonderful time ... in the sack I believe you call it --
Hello.
Sam, if you're not doing anything New Year's -- obviously you're not doing anything New Year's -- we're having some people over, all of them married, not one even remotely interested in playing around.  Does that sound great or what?  I can't think of the last time I was at a party when anything actually happened.
I'm probably not interested in whatever you're selling.
Who is this?
I'm not mad at you.  Okay, I'm not mad at you.
Got me there.  What's your Christmas wish, Jonah?
You don't like the one he was now?
I'm sure he won't be angry once he realizes how concerned you are about him.
Just because someone's looking for a nice guy doesn't make them desperate.
You'll like it.
Eighty dollars.
I'm sorry.  I'm just --
You see someone you like, you get a feeling about them, you ask them if they want to have a drink or --
If you get a new wife, I guess you'll have sex with her, huh?
Hi, Dad.  Dad, this is Jessica.
Dad, this is amazing.  If you play this backwards, it says "Paul is dead."
It was sinking.
Bye bye blackbird.
Just this one part, okay?  "I have been an excellent third-baseman for as long as I or anyone else can remember, and I guarantee you will not get one past me"
Here is Seattle.  And here is Baltimore.  Case closed. 
Jonah!
Thank Victoria for dinner.
Don't ever do that again.
Have you seen my wallet?
Hi, Sam.  And let me guess -- you must be Jonah.
Yes?
Oh.
We can't finish the job.  She's on her sixth painter, now she's thinking maybe she wants the fireplace rebricked --
He's ten.
Want to go up to your office, Mr. Alexander?
The men would like to know who this gentleman is.
I mean it. I know your work record. You were in line for foreman when this trouble started -- did you know that? You had a real future with this company, but you let those Reds stir you up. And now they'll sell you down the river. Why don't you wake up, Ray?  That's your name, isn't it, Ray?
Are you going to let us pass -- or do I have to call the Sheriff?
Not so sure about that. Letter of the Law, you know. All the injunction says is no picketing by miners.
You haven't tried locking them up!
Take a drink. Calm down!
Now why don't you let these gentlemen pass? Don't you know who's in that car?
It's like Charley Vidal says -- there's two kinds of slavery, wage slavery and domestic slavery. The Woman Question, he calls it.
Question, question -- the problem, what to do about 'em.
He says give 'em equality. Equality in jobs, equality in the home. Also sex equality.
Super's busy -- with your Negotiatin' Committee.
Who? A scab?
To the mine?
Come on, Esperanza -- how about it? We got to.
It's all set. Consuelo's squad can take they day off tomorrow. We're taking over.
So they had a little taste of what its like to be a woman ... and they run away.
We did. It got lost in the shuffle.
Forgive me ... for saying you never thought of me.
You are no good to me -- in jail.
Not just Juanito. You'll have it good too, Esperanza. We're going to win this strike.
It's not fair ... I should be there with them. After all, I'm the one who got the women the vote.
We've got to have a talk, you and me.
A meeting?
When?
Ramn -- you can't.
It's a lot to them. They'd do anything to open that mine.
Ramn were not getting weaker. We're stronger than ever before.  They're getting weaker. They thought they could break our picket line. And they failed. And now they can't win unless they pull off something big, and pull it off fast.
I don't know. But I can feel it coming. It's like ... like a lull before the storm. Charley Vidal says ...
Yes. I talk of dignity. The Anglo bosses look down on you, and you hate them for it. "Stay in your place, you dirty Mexican" -- that's what they tell you. But why must you say to me, "Stay in your place." Do you feel better having someone lower than you?
Aw, cut it out, Ruth.
Because most of us here are Mexican- Americans! Because we want equality with Anglo miners -- the same pay, the same conditions.
That's all right -- it's no secret. My name's Hartwell. I'm from the company's Eastern office.
No. New York.
Forgot what?
I know, it's wrong. Just let me go. I'll leave town ... just let me go.
What is it?
Because I don't know him and I don't really know you, partner.
Oh, he's a keeper all right.
It's not that easy.
Fuck you.
Then make sure he gets put away for longer.
Miles Davis. "All Blues."
It gets me through the day.
So you're just attracted to me, is that it?
There you go again. You're nothing but false notes.
You think you're the only one down here with a sad story?
Who is it?
We been through that.
He knows where I work.
It's not that easy. I just got a raise. I need the money.
From day one.  I was a breach birth. They tried for hours to turn my little butt around. But I wouldn't let 'em.
What's wrong, Danny?
Colette, go.
Oh shit
Closure? How do you find closure when her killers are still running around out there?
I'm genuinely happy that you found some peace, Nancy. But you can't forgive for Liz.  No one can.  And you can't forgive for me.
Where to?
Finland is a country.
Nice dealer you got there, Jimmy.
Fuuuuuck
I'm getting a 10% finder's fee from my man if I can get the right price.
Jimmy, where do you find these people?
Why?
What?
No one ever noticed?
Wait  If you don't trust me, why did you tell me that stuff about not using drugs?
I'm gonna get this developed and send it to the Warren Commission.
I don't know, 14,000 a kilo?
Pooh-Bear. come on, man.  What is this?  It's me, Danny. I thought we had a deal.
Shoot him.
I ought to just call this whole thing off right now.
I've got a hot one.
Danny, I'm touched.
You think this is funny motherfucker?
That's real sweet, Garcetti.  Thanks.
Took a pig-slicker to the heart.
This the guy?
Dude is bugging.  Transparent spiders, plastic men - the whole nine yards.
Danny, it's really pains me to have to tell you this, but do you remember DOMINGO, that wetback you helped us put away for trafficking a few months back?
He knows somebody ratted him.
Jimmy?
He's the only one I told.
Sounds like you hooked up with some fine citizens, Flynne.
Why doesn't Palmdale P.D. just raid the guy?
A virtuoso rendition.  TOM VAN ALLEN is nothing short of dazzling in his interpretation of Miles Davis' haunting, moody piece.
And he has a really hot ass with hardly any hair on it.
Really?
Casualties?
Yes, sir.
Sir?
As a matter of fact, I am.
In the back of a nineteen and thirty- one stretch Hudson with a big ole' trailer.
We got us a tent, forty-two feet across, eighteen feet at center, hundred-and-ten foldin' chairs. Circuit's eleven towns, covers all 'a Hasset County and most 'a Weller County.  I expect that upon completion of my military service I will be joinin' said ministry.
That must be four thousand yards.
Last I knew.
Y'all come back.
What do you think?
He ain't Wade.
No kiddin'?
Me?  I'm walking with my hound, Lucy, it's about an hour 'fore sunrise and we're out huntin' coon.  I got me a flask of pure Kentucky mash whiskey...
What the hell's the matter with you, Jackson?
Sir, I understand.  I don't like it, but I understand.
It's worth it.
Sorry, sir, fresh out of trucks, how 'bout a '38 Ford Roadster, hard-top, red with black interior.
A paratrooper named Ryan.  He's going home, if he's alive.
Glad of it.
It looks like a Renoir.
What is it?
What about our grenades?
Would they notice and eighty-eight?
GO!
Beasley's dead.
Fresh out.
It's not normal, not reading letters from home.
You think they'll be alright?
They guys here aren't going to be able to hold out until battalion shows up.
Command isn't going to let them withdraw and the Germans sure as hell aren't going to let them surrender.
You alright?
Yeah, Vecchio, I couldn't remember his name, he was a good kid, remember how he used to walk on his hands and sing that song about the man on flying trapeze?
No problem.  A pair of deuces?  Less? So what?  I bluff.  It used to tear me apart when I'd get one of my men killed, but what was I supposed to do?  Break down in front of the ones who were standing there waiting for me to tell them what to do?  Of course not, so I bluffed, and after a while, I started to fall for my own bluff. It was great, it made everything so much easier.  Sarge Is that why your hand's been shaking?
You know Wade was the eleventh of the twelve, you're the last one still alive.
Captain, can I put in for a transfer?
Sir, what if they send some other company into Caen ahead of us while we're pinned down here?
Strides through the chaos, avoiding the passing vehicles.  He sees his men and walks toward them.  Reiben hurries up to Miller, pleading.
Sorry, I need a B.A.R. man, you're the best.
Trust me, you're the best.
I'm listening, sir.
General Gavin is going to be very irritated at you, Captain.
I'd much rather die in Caen than Ramelle, sir.  It's a personal thing.
Maybe.  But what if he dies on the way back?  you see what I'm saying, sir?  The best possible situation is, he's dead, we find his body, more or less intact, we grab one of his dog-tags and high-tail it back to the beach, or better yet, we head over to Caen and catch up with division.
Hears the FAINT DISTANT RUMBLE OF THE TANK.  Barely has time to react. Sees:
Is jumped on by one.  Upham FIRES. KILLS the German.
Jackson was from West Fork, Tennessee, he was going to be a preacher, his father and uncles have a traveling ministry out of the back of a stretch Hudson.
I don't know, I kind of like Wade's idea about the cruise ship.  I've never been to Tahiti.
Demolition, right?
How do you do it?
You think he really believed it?
How fast?
I'm supposed to be leaving on a fellowship that I worked for my entire life.  I don't even care.  I met this boy over the summer, and I, I can't see him because of this, I can't talk to him, I can't talk to my father about... I wore these clothes, I thought, I thought that if I looked right and if I acted right then someone would talk to me.  But I look awful and I feel awful, could you, could you please talk to me?  Be a little decent.
You're trying to get me to say something, that's why you're telling me all of this.
Why would you stay so long with an operation that is so clearly not a growth enterprise?
Yeah, she won a fellowship.
I'm sorry, but they turned down your card.
It's no problem.  I called Mom and Dad in Germany; it's like they were there.
You're tough, J-man.
No, no, don't go in there.
Yes.
Alright.
The world is full of guys.  Be a man.  Don't be a guy.
"Dear Diane, I'll always be there for you, all the love in my heart, Lloyd."  I've never gotten a letter like this, have you?
I can't give you that.  This guy's been ripping off grandma and grandpa for seventeen years.  He's been getting it from every end.  I'd love to hear his story.
Lloyd, she's being difficult.
Lloyd, why do you have to be like this?
Alright, no more, I'm going to save it.
Ha!
I won?
God, I'll have to go on a plane.
She's not the world's greatest flyer, let me tell you.  When she was eight years old, she...
So anyway, they closed the doors, and she starts to scream.  I've never in my life heard anyone scream quite like that.
Morning.
You should be.
Unbelievable.  This is a nightmare.
If I pick it up, we'll only get back together.
Dad, are you okay in there?
This is me telling you about me.
Thank-you.  The real world.
Yeah.  I just wanted to congratulate you on your scholarship to England, and I wanted to tell you that I thought your speech was really incredible.
Okay, um, so it's Lloyd and... uh... uh... let's go out.  Do you wanna go out?
Actually, I think that I...
Alright.  This is really great.  Alright, we're going out. It's a date.  It's a scam.  Whatever, whatever, alright, I'll pick you up at what, eight O' clock?
Whoa.
Oh.  Um, would it be terrible if I wanted to go home early?
So we can finally talk?
Alright, this is some of the things they wrote me; "Glad I finally met you", "You always seemed nice", "Wish I could have known you more"...
Sure I do.
Thanks.  But either way it still feels...
So what's your job this summer?
I only have something like sixteen weeks.
Nice one.
Oh.
Me?  Sure I do.
I think that's ageism, and that's, that's being prejudiced against people because they're old.  Maybe their mouths don't work as well as yours.
Check your mail tomorrow.  I sent you a letter, a letter.
It did?
I was just going to tell you that I love you.  I said it.
Well, I need to study, and...
'Cause I'm worried, did you just break up with me?
Yeah you do.
You shared it with a dick.
Is this because of your dad?
What do you want?
One more time would be nice.
It's your castle, man.
No my brother, you have to go buy your own.
Sorry, Diane isn't here at the moment.
Is this the guy with the Mustang?
Hi.  Lloyd Dobler, sir.  Pleasure to meet you.
She wouldn't get out of the car.  I brought her all the way here, she said she was going to come here, and she wouldn't get out of the car.  But I thought that is was important, that she come to see you, because I know that if you go somewhere and you don't deal with your family stuff, then you're just gonna, she's gonna, um...
I know.
"You can't know the horrible disappointment I feel..."
She can't still be angry at this, it's gotta get better.
I was gonna...
We're full on bonded.
Later for you, Luke.
I didn't ask you about the list, I asked you your name.
The gentleman thinks a mistake's been made.
What?
We started without you.
You know, they told me you were going to be trouble - Czurda and Scherner.
You took my workers.
This is not my problem.
What do I got for you?
Like this?
You have any idea what a shirt like this costs?
How many?
What's the matter, everything all right at home?  Mila's okay?
Get the contracts and I'm sure you'll do very well.  In fact the worse things get the better you'll do.  It was a "pleasure."
What was that about the SS, the rate, the ... ?
You have to understand, Goeth's under enormous pressure.  You have to think of it in his situation.  He's got this whole place to run, he's responsible for everything that goes on here, all these people - he's got a lot of things to worry about.  And he's got the war. Which brings out the worst in people.  Never the good, always the bad.  Always the bad. But in normal circumstances, he wouldn't be like this.  He'd be all right.  There'd be just the good aspects of him.  Which is a wonderful crook.  A guy who loves good food, good wine, the ladies, making money...
I'll talk to him.
There's a rumor you've been going around miscalibrating the machines.  I don't think that's a good idea.
I'll talk to you later.
I didn't do enough.
How's the name search going?
I would say we are now officially baffled.
That shit. He only calls you when he's drunk. Don't go over there.
Hang up...call...
We're co-sponsoring the Acid Rain mixer at the Sig Ep. house tonight.
"Drink with your brain." That's our motto. Who are you calling for?
I just thought if I saw you face to face, maybe it would help.
Its perfect, Sidney. No one will ever suspect me. I have proof. Im the victim.
I get my revenge and make some fast cash.
Fair enough.
And are the police sure about that?
I couldnt believe you didnt recognize me. You even interviewed me for your book.
I'm sorry, baby. What can I do'?
Lemme take you home.
My screwed up life shouldn't have to bleed onto my friends.
Go on, untie him.
She's got guards with her.
Need some help, honey.
He hates Oliver Stone.
He sent me the cutest e-mail.
And now, drum roll please...
..so we had to be different but yet the same because if you venture to far away from your orginal story you completely alienate the audience...
Yes, I do retain reading skills. Shock.
I never meant to imply...
And it's sexier in the dark.
Maybe not. But think about the sex. As frustrated as I am...
Maybe they never got here. He could have taken her anywhere.
Let's go.
Oh my God. How could it happen?
You go, it's all stairs, I can take it from here.
Hey, I got stuff to do. But I'll find you later, okay.
I don't play games.
What do you want?
What do you mean?
No, wait...
Shut up. Mickey, you and I can take her late evening.
I got a surprise for you.
"If I should stay. I would only be in your way. So I'll go. And yet, I know, I'll think of you each step of the way...
Time to change numbers again?
Okay, you're sure about skipping Calculas?
What about rehearsal?
A patio chair comes flying through a glass door. The young girl in the movie tears off running, SCREAMING, flying through the room.
Do you want to die?
Come on, baby. Lighten up a little, will ya?
If he's innocent he'll have an alibi.
Oh that's right. Those poor poor people. God Ben Damon was such a hottie.
All I'm saying is I'm gonna be royally p.o.'d if you don't catch my acting debut.
I did. Hon, although I got a total of six minutes screen time, they're the best six minutes of the movie.
Jesus.  Hello?
Really? You're such a talented actor.
What?!
Yeah.
Listen, I'm busy. Nobody has access to those files except studio execs. Can you please go away now?
That's STAB 3, Miss Weathers. It looks like we're going to be getting a warrant to speak with Miss Prescott anyway.
Please, call me Gale.
Jesus Gale what happened?
Excuse me?
What do you mean?
Detective Kincaid?
Why would the police come to you?
What about me?
You used to say that was our strength.
Brace yourself, Gale, all of this is actually not About you.
The boys said no.  She wouldn't give her name. A month later, the station gets broken into, the file room ransacked.
What part of 'Off the record' don't you understand?
I've got my suspicions but still, nothing  you say can ever make me take my eyes off one person.
Jennifer needs me.
OH. OH GOD. GALE --
Thank you.
Has anyone else every used your phone?
I've got an idea, I'll hook up with you guys later.
What's your point?
Well it's a honor to be here amongst so many fans of the genre. And I must say that any of you worried that Jerry Rapp, or Tori or David not returning to complete the STAB trilogy, have no fear, Roman is here. Aided with my excellent cast of newcomers I believe we're going to pull off one of the best Stabs yet.
God damn you Gale Weathers! Don't you see? The killer is choosing  his victims as they die in the script! Ben Damon's character was the first one to get offed. So was his girlfriend - but she wasn't cast yet so his real girlfriend was killed - then Sarah Darling's Candy, and now me!
Shit! Where the hell are Tom and Angelina?
Being Gale Weathers.  What the hell are you doing?
Possibly.
I think Milton's the killer. I think he just went out to kill another cast member.
Gale Weathers. What a surprise.
Hey I really liked that piece you did on me last month. The one where you said my car accident was caused by me drinking and drugs, and how I faked the tire blow-out just so my insurance wouldn't sky rocket.
Oh my God! Sidney, you ran fast or what?  Hey.
Roman Bridger, director. And brother.  She slammed the door in my face, Sid. Said I was Rina's child and Rina was dead. And it struck me, what a good idea! So I watched her, made a little home movie, a little family film. Seems Maureen, mom, really got around. I mean, Cotton Weary was one thing, everybody knew about that, but Billy's father, that was the key! Your boyfriend didn't like seeing his daddy in my movies. Didn't like it at all. And once I supplied the motive, all the kid needed was a few pointers. Have a partner to sell out in case you get caught, find someone to frame, it was like her was making a movie.
Oh shit.  Hello? Director's office.
Goddamnit I am getting so fed up with these re-writes. It's like every five minutes there's a new script. God, and you just know this all because of STAB 2's script winding up on the internet two months after it wrapped shooting.
No.
I want to finish what I started. I want to finish the game.
Don't do it!  If you do one thing to attract attention, one thing, I'll kill them both. Now, do you have somewhere we can be alone?
You're dead!
Alright I'm here, now show your  face so we can finish this.
I didn't kill anybody.
Duh... that's quick.
Because I'm trying to build your self-esteem. You're far too sensitive.
You ready to party hard tonight?
You rode your bike out there?
What are you doing here?
My dad's in the other room.
It just occurred to me that I've never snuck through your bedroom window.
Would you settle for a PG-13 relationship?
Jesus, SHIT!
I'm so sorry... please understand.
No, it's me, Billy. I need time. I'm still adjusting to my mom.
No, Billy. I'm the one who's been selfish and self-absorbed with all of my post traumatic stress.
Everytime I get close to you I see my mom. I know it doesn't make sense.
Why did you kill my mother?
I don't understand...
Yes.
Hello.
What?
Popcorn.
Uh-huh.
Uh... NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET.
Nah, I don't think so...
What do you want?
I'm two seconds from calling the police.
What do you want?
I wanna play a game.
Please don't do this...
What's his name?
Well, we can hope, can't we? We certainly don't have any leads. A ghost mask, a cellular phone -- not much there.
If you'll excuse me, ma'am.
What brings you out to these parts?
Not much story here. Just a bunch of kids cutting loose.
Does mom know?
What is she doing here?
At the airport.
Billy was released. His cellular bill was clean. He didn't make those calls.
I know. We're checking every cellular account in the county. Any calls made to you or Casey Becker are being cross-referenced. It's gonna take time but we'll find him.
Have they found my father?
It's Deputy Riley today, Sid.
There's more. Guess what tomorrow is? The anniversary of his wife's death. It all fits. He's our man.
Hold off for now. Just stay close to her.
Casey? Where are you honey? Call the police, goddamnit.
What? What?
No, not so fast. We have nothing concrete.
I'm not here to fight.
Please. You owe me.
I think you falsely identified him. Yes.
Good try, Randy. Tell Tatum to hurry. Bye now.
Stu was with me last night.
Fuck you, nut case. Where were you last night?
Only if it's a nice Meg Ryan movie.
You coming tonight?
I thought everything was checked out.
Yeah.
His movie nut mind has snapped, Sid. He's gone psycho.
You heard Billy -- shut the fuck up.
Why are they doing this?
If Tatum sees you -- she'll draw blood.
Oh God! You don't know? Casey Becker and Steve Forrest were killed last night.
Thanks, Tatum.
You can't prove a rumor. That's why it's a rumor.
You're right. I'm cracking up. Ignore me.
That's mature.
How's that?
How is it working for a scumbag like this? You proud of yourself?
There are seven deadly sins.  Gluttony, wrath, greed...
... envy, sloth, pride and lust.  Seven.
Thank you.  Tell them, thank you.
She was... she was on the bed.  She was just sitting on the bed.
Jesus Christ, man, don't shoot me!
I don't believe it.
What's so exciting?
You didn't know.
I can't wait for you to see.  I can't wait...  It's really going to be something.
You should be thanking me.
Is that clear?
It's a package deal.  You get the phone with the office.
How's that?
Did you read them?
Oh, yeah, sure.  You got to be kidding?!
He just may be nuts enough.
All we do is pick up the pieces.  We take all the evidence, and all the pictures and samples.  We write everything down and note what time things happened...
We put it in a nice neat pile and file it away, on the slim chance it's ever needed in a courtroom.  It's like collecting diamonds on a desert island.  You keep them just in case you ever get rescued, but it's a pretty big ocean out there.
The fingerprints.
Hey, Freud, what brand of bullshit are you shoveling, huh?  Right now he's probably dancing around his room in a pair of his mommy's panties, singing show tunes and rubbing himself with peanut butter...
We don't know for sure...
Just, realize... this is not some common lunatic.  The type of intestinal fortitude it must take... to keep a man bound for a full year.  To connect tubes to his genitals.  To sever his hand and use it to plant fingerprints.  He's methodical and exacting, and worst of all, he's patient.
Well, that was money well spent.
It's probably nothing, but even if it is, it's no skin off our teeth.  The man at Hot Dog World is a friend, in the Bureau.
For a long time, the F.B.I.'s been hooked into the library system, keeping accurate records.
Modern Homicide Investigation.  In Cold Blood.  Of Human Bondage.  Human Bondage?
The Writings of Saint Thomas Aqu... Aquin...
Are you alright?
Think about it...
He's preaching.
You know... there's not going to be a happy ending to this.  It's not possible anymore.
You're talking about people who are mentally ill.  You're...
Listen to yourself.  You say, "the problem with people is they don't care, so I don't care about people."  But, you're already here.  You've been here a long time.  So, there's a part of you that knows, even if everything you say is true, none of it matters.
Oh, you want to stay now?
You know he's fucking us.
No.
Slut.
Put your gun down!!
I'm sorry about this, Mrs. Gould.  I really am.
It smells good.
How long have you lived here?
I don't know why I asked you to come.
Well, I got up one morning and went to work... just like any other day, except it was my first since hearing about the baby. And, I... I felt this fear and anxiety washing over me.  I looked around, and I thought, how can we raise a child surrounded by all this?  How can a child grow up here?  So, that night, I told her I didn't want us to have it, and over the next few weeks, I convinced her it was wrong.  I mean... I wore her down, slowly.
Passed the Todd place comin' in... What happened to 'em?
Not tonight...Ben, put that sword back.
They got to stop <U>sometime</U>...if they're human at all, they got to stop!
You've said that enough!...Maybe Lucy's dead...maybe they're both dead...but if I hear it from you again, I'll fight ya, Mr. Edwards!
Why'd they break off?  Was there water in that canyon?
<U>Charlie</U> <U>MacCorry</U>!...You weren't fixin' to marry HIM??
If you're talkin' about that crazy murder charge...
You askin' as a Reverend or a Captain, Sam?
It's what we're here for, ain't it?
You got any more orders, Captain?
Fight fair, son...Use your fists!
I got to ask you and Martin to ride to the State Capitol with me, Ethan.
I say NO!
Why Colonel Greenhill is Colonel Greenhill, sir...Commanding Officer, Fifth U.S. Cavalry...I'm Lieutenant Greenhill, sir.
Martin! Ride me as far as the well!
No Debbie! That ain't what happened! They been lyin' to you...
I've come now...
Leggo my arm...You look mangier 'n ever.
Keep talking.
And maybe you lie...
Don't forget to come back with my thousand dollars.
Not quite...Quarter Cherokee. The rest is Welsh...So they tell me.
Somethin' mighty fishy about this trail, Uncle Ethan...
Well, come on!
Good night...Laurie...
Jorgensen's been runnin' his cattle with my own...
You ask her!
Least, <U>THEY</U> won't feed any Comanches this winter...Killin' buffalo's as good as killin' Injuns in this country.
Well, you're a widower now...
No...She's not...
Lemme alone...
I saw it...And don't try to tell me it was Aunt Martha's or Lucy's...
Why it's just a snip of calico...
Don't go takin' that stuff...
Might at least have left me my pants!
I...I wrote you a letter...Reckon you didn't get it...
But I allus loved you...You know that, without my sayin' it...I couldn't bring myself to ask you to wait...the little I had... not knowin' how much longer until we found Debbie...
She'd be about thirteen now...
Where?
Why else?
Say it anyway.  Come on, how much do you love me?
Ellen, move aside...
So, how does it feel to be kissed by two women?
I mean the armchair!
What are you doing?
I have a funny feeling.  Do you think we'll get over all that's happened?
Cherry-red Tears.
Cherry-red Tears, your first book. I read it at least nine times.  And then I found out you were going to attend some kind of book fair.
I miss Tommi so much.
Martin, it's not funny!
Now, what did I do to deserve this?
Martin, what-
You know, Tommi wants me to become the man I used to be.
Do I look like it that much?
Hey, my man!  How's the masterpiece coming along?
Ah
Follow that boat!
Tomorrow.
We have no Juliet!
The title?
A woman of property?
So now you are free to love
I saw his Tamburlaine, you know. Wonderful.
It's a comedy.
And a share. We will be partners, Mr. Fennyman!
But I have to pay the actors and the authors.
This time we take your boots off!
Mr. Shakespeare has given me the part of the Apothecary!
Ned, I swear I knew nothing of this!
It is over.
Do you know it?
Romeo and Rosaline. Scene One! God, I'm good!
Well, I to my work, you to yours. When can I see pages?
Cut round him for now.
By God, I wish I knew.
What is the story?
This is a different one.
Piety is for Sunday! And two hours at prayer is not piety, it is self- importance!
Playhouses are not for well-born ladies.
Well-monied is the same as well-born and well-married is more so. Lord Wessex was looking at you tonight.
Like Valentine and Silvia?
But playwrights teach nothing about love, they make it pretty, they make it comical, or they make it lust. They cannot make it true.
Your Majesty!
As stories must when love's denied--with tears and a journey. Those whom God has joined in marriage, not even I can put asunder.
But your voice  Have they dropped?
She will breed. If she do not, send her back.
I have, Master Shakespeare.
Anon, good nurse. Anon.  Master Shakespeare?!
Alas indeed, for I thought you the highest poet of my esteem and a writer of plays that capture my heart.
You can bring them with a word.
Can you love a fool?
I do not know how to undress a man.
You would not leave me?
Let him be damned for his pages!
In heaven, perhaps. It is not a comedy I am writing now. A broad river divides my lovers--family, duty, fate--as unchangeable as nature.
Nono.
A hired player no longer. Fifty pounds, Will, for the poet of true love.
At sea, then--a voyage to a new world?she lands upon a vast and empty shore. She is brought to the dukeOrsino.
Why, yes! My fortune lies in my plantations. The tobacco weed. I need four thousand pounds to fit out a ship and put my investments to work--I fancy tobacco has a future. We will not stay there long, three or four years . . .
Will you defy your father and your Queen?
She wants to inspect you. At Greenwich, come Sunday. Be submissive, modest, grateful and brief.
You look sad, my lady! Let me take you riding.
Your name?
She tells me to keep away. She is to marry Lord Wessex. What should I do?
She loves me, Thomas!
Your aunt?
And her voice? Like lark song?
I think the lady is wise to keep your love at a distance. For what lady could live up to it close to, when her eyes and lips and voice may be no more beautiful than mine? Besides, can a lady born to wealth and noble marriage love happily with a Bankside poet and player?
Here we come at last, my lord!
There was a man, poet--a theatre poet, I heard--does he come to the house?
Do a little freebasemaybe, from time to time?
I was trying to educate you.
Chess. Chess is often used as well.
You learn that in your psychotherapy group?
He made it clear.
No.
No.
No.
You think so?
So who's going to do it?
You know what. Who's going to do it.
Don't you worry about that.
What's the problem?
Yeah, but you were good, you were really good. Fucking bin-bag', I liked that. You were good. You explored your maleness to the full there.
Doesn't it worry you?
What's all this for, more security?
I want to secure it.
What for? What did you want? The money? Was that it?
I'm glad you're so certain, Alex. It makes us feel a whole lot better.
Sex lines? Is that it? Triple X-rated interactive fantasy? Old habits die hard.
For the best. Exactly. I wouldn't want things to end on a downer.
It's very kind of you to offer, but --
Out in the woods. Three bodies. Decomposed. Mutilated. Beyond recognition.
Of course you don't know anything about it. If you knew anything about it, I wouldn't have to send you over there to cover it.
Well?
It looks like he's writing everything down.
Well, is it?
When you slaughter a goat and wrench its heart out with your bare hands, do you then summon hellfire?
No. Be someone else like him. One is enough. And what happened to that girl, that friend of yours, the one that came round. I liked her. I really felt we had something. She could have moved in. We had chemistry.
Has he tried down the back of the fridge? I mean, that's where I normally find things.
So we'll meet him, then?
You see, they don't really know me.
David hasn't seen him either.
He's got a car?
What sort of car?
You want me to kick it open?
Now?
Thats not a story, Alex. It's a corpse.
I don't want to. It's different.
Hello. Hello.
Don't know. No one said anything. ALEX Rendered speechless with desire. I recall that feeling, from the days when I had such a thing.
I don't see the point in that.
Leave him alone.
He'll come down. Leave him alone.
Later. But first -- him.
Expecting anyone?
Aren't you going to answer it?
I refuse.
It's about me and David.
Stop him, Alex. You've got to stop him.
Interesting.
It's OK. There's no problem.
Of course.
Two?
We understood there were four people living here. Not always, of course, but now, four.
Just get on with it, Alex.
Is this what they always look like?
Were you expecting anyone? Tonight?
I thought you'd gone to work.
What?
Here.
There's a whole wide world out there, and it all needs to be accounted for, doesn't it?
But they sneer, don't they?
And that's why I think you fit in here.
You get the job done.
Oh, him. Well, he died.
You must be Hugo.
It's nice.
For what?
The human condition.
I write about it?
Sorry?
You're in a good mood today, George.
Do you think George is a fairy?
That's George.
Whoever she is, she doesn't give up, does she?
What're you looking for?
Thanks a lot.
She did?
Wow.
I'm perfectly calm, George, I'm simply saying you have no respect for me, that you're incapable of distinguishing between me and one of your average Hollywood... mummers...
-- I like myself far too much, far too much.
George --
I'm not used to that kind of treatment.
-- Anyway.
No, I know.
Hi.
But aren't you...
She what?
Oh, no.
You know what I'm talking about.
Did you hear me?
Well, are you? Are you queer?
What?
Wonderful woman.
I went to school with her husband.
I've got the customers... that's my point. I'm the one they want. If I had my own shop, they'd leave and come to me. I have a lot of customers.
You promised you'd do the show.
You do it.
Not too much, don't cut too much.
Bernstein... seemed to think I hated men.
Can I count on that? I just want to see Lester with me and that cunt in the same room tonight.
Sit down.
Don't do it.
I don't know what gets into me.
No, I blew it, I blew it with Lester.
You don't think so? I do.
Am I entertaining you?
You're going to kill me.
So I'm saying it...
So what? You don't love him, do you? Answer me.
God, there's Lester...
I can't just let him stand by the door...
-- you shouldn't do me like that...
I have to see you.
There were some shots.
I've had these dumb dreams lately.
Now, George --
You're great.
Honey?
Will we live together?
But in the same house, you know, one house.
They want me to go to Egypt for three weeks.
Jill, say hello to Felicia.
Yeah, baby...
Hey, I'm, you know --
No, but I think they might.
When is that, George?
But I never know when you're working and when you're not working!
Jill says nothing.
I don't want to fight, George.
Well that's something.
You did fuck him, didn't you?
Didn't you, baby?
Let go of me or I'll scream, I'll call the police.
-- yes.
Please!... that's not like you.
Stop it.
Tonight?
-- Anything, I don't care what it is, just so it's something.
Sorry, honey, I...
You look like you've had quite a work-out.
It's a difficult situation, and I want you to know I appreciate it. Tonight's going to be real tough for me --
You live like a pig.
What do they look like?...
Sit down.
I wanna hear about it.
Was it me, did you have something against me?
Why, why do you think that is?
What about Jackie?
You really think so?
All right, who're you with? Jill?
Awww --
You're home.
I'm coming over.
Now listen, Jackie, I'm not jealous of anybody, I just can't afford to get caught... off base.
Of course not.
Shut the door, shut the door!
They get hair all over the place.
Does she know about us?
Jackie Shawn.
I think you're crazy. Don't look over, it's Lenny Silverman.
Jill, I'm just trying to be helpful.
It must be something.
We don't think marriage is important.
How much?
It's been so long I don't how long?
-- See, I just know that if I go to Egypt, well, things happen, I just don't know what'll happen to us, he just never seems to think ahead, does he?
-- Yesss?
Sort of.
-- still -- at least we should tell him we're going. C'mon.
We'll let you know tomorrow.
I think that was farther west in the Sierras.
You wouldn't ever hurt Mummy and me, would you?
I love you, Danny.  I love you more than anything else in the whole world, and I'd never do anything to hurt you, never... You know that, don't you, huh?
Chocolate.
Who says you ain't supposed to?
Yes.
I don't know.
No, I'm scared of nothing here. It's just that you know some places are like people, some shine and some don't.  I guess you could say the Overlook Hotel here has something about it that's like shining.
Room 237?
Yeah.
The loser has to keep American clean, how's that?
Okay Danny, you win.  Let's take the rest of this walking, huh?
I didn't think it was going to be this big, did you?
I won't make any noise.
Mommy... Mommy...!
No.
Please...
Mrs. Torrance, I don't think you have anything to worry about.  I'm quite sure there is nothing physically wrong with Danny.
But eh what was the matter with him?
Tony.
Won't keep you a moment, sir.
Grady?
Delbert Grady.
How?
No need to rub it in, Mr. Grady. I'll deal with that situation as soon as I get out of here.
I'd be glad to do that, sir.  Oh why don't you call me back in about eh twenty minutes?
Hi Lloyd.  I've been away.  Now I'm back.
Good Morning, hon.  Your breakfast is ready.
Well, something'll come.  It's just a matter of settling back into the habit of writing every day.
and it will then take me time to get back to where I was, understand?
or whether you don't hear me typing, whatever the fuck you hear me doing in here, when I am in here that means that I am working - that means don't come in.  Now do you think you can handle that?
No.  It's the truth, really.  I swear it.  Danny told me.  He went up into one of the bedrooms, the door was open, and he saw this crazy woman in the bath-tub.  She tried to strangle him.
He's still asleep.
Somebody did that to him.
Stay away from me,
Stay away...!
Stay away from me.
Give me the bat.
Mr. Ullman?
Very nice to meet you.
Have any trouble finding us?
I don't believe they did.
The police eh... they thought that it was what the old-timers used to call cabin-fever, a kind of claustrophobic reaction which can occur when people are
This is the staff wing of the hotel. None of the other bedrooms are heated during the winter.
Oh...well this is our gold ballroom.
Thanks.
Bill, would you have the Torrances' things brought in their apartment.
If Father Lowe is an innocent little lamb, why hasn't he picked up the telephone and called Constable Haller to tell him Marty's sending poison-pen letters?
You always take his side because he's a cripple! Well, it's not my fault that he's a cripple!
What's the money for?
Don't you touch me, snotbrains!
Ralph Houk! You can't bet a manager! Stone the crows!
You all right, Marty?
Huh?
Don't call me dear boy.
You gave me a heart attack, Marty. I'm dying. I hope you're happy, because you are looking at a dying man.
It goes fast, all right- and if your mother finds out just how fast, Marty, I will have a new job. Singing soprano with the Vienna Boys' Choir.
I know you don't. But I want this to be our secret. You get that, don't you?
Was it a prescription?
It wasn't- I'll bet you it wasn't. Because to get a prescription he'd have to see a doctor.
I want you to turn this into a silver bullet.
I suppose so. You kids ought to go up to bed.
Remember, Al... we'll be at the Ritz-Carlton in Boston tomorrow night! Or at the funeral parlor. It's Stickney and-
Yeah.  We all got caught.  Shoplifting. Cuttin' school.  Cuttin' up some bitch with a blade.  So we gotta come here.  So we'll be good, in the future.  So we'll learn valuable lessons.  And I learned mine.  I will be incredibly good, I will never rip out nobody's nose-ring by accident ever again.  Can I go now?
Okay, so maybe I'm a nun -- so, you want to ask me something?  You want to listen, for once in your little lives? You want to pay some attention?
You know, I just might!
Well, what about the sex stuff?  What if some dude is after you, and he's always saying stuff, commin' on sweet and mellow.  Like, oh, baby, you know you'll love it.  Oh, baby, if you loved me, you'd stay.
Yeah, right to the cops.  No way.
For the first time in I don't know how long.  I wanted everything done right. Open and above board.  I told Father Antonelli I was in love.  I told him it was a special love, for all the ages.
No... it's fine.
Sure.
Babe, what happened here?  Look at you.
Look at that.  Get a gander.
Is this... choir practice?
You see?  We've got the voices.  They're just allover the place. I've heard all of you, in the shower --you're decent. Better than me.  We just need charts -- harmony -- chops.
Mary Patrick -- do you remember the Dixie Cups?
We know you don't want to bring pain and misery to your friends and neighbors. We'll pray to find you some honest work.
Which convent?  It was, um, the Little Sisters... of the Moonlight.  In Vegas. Everybody used to come to Mass.  Frank. Dean.  Sammy.  Right at ringside.
Mary Clarence, are you with us?
Sure.  Kind of... free-lance.
Of course.  I'm a nun.  Four Popes now. The Lord hates a loafer.
Is there any syrup?
Hey -- you re supposed to be the cheerful one.  Why do I suddenly feel like Snow White?
It's after five.  We have to bathe.
What?  What does she want now?  I did the dishes.  I oiled the pews.  I dusted the hymnals.  Two hundred hymnals.  Why can't people share?
Well, then there's only one thing to do.
We need experience.
Bobs
Those people are wonderful!  Why don't we ever see them in church?
Goddamn it!
Are you leaving us?
You were unhappy?
Sit down.
Miss Van Cartier.
Sisters, for the rest of the day we shall declare a Vow of Silence.
This shall be your cell, Mary Clarence.
You were right the first time.  Is this like, solitary?  The cooler?  Where's the furniture?
It's like the Stone Age.  The room time forgot.  What about a phone?
Wait.  No.  You're kidding.  Lights out? At nine?  My day's just starting.
What's wrong with my life?
Yeah?
Deal with it, sweet thing.  It's important, nowadays.  You just practice at home, with a balloon and a banana.
Mary Clarence, perhaps you are correct.
Please let me try.  I'm begging you.
But -- there's so much more to do right here.  And look, if it's about me, I mean, I'm gone.
I don't think so.  What about skydiving? A crank call to Billy Graham?
From Vince?  What a guy.  Doo-lang, doo- lang.
Nuns, Eddie.  There are nuns here. Everywhere.  It's crawling with 'em.
And one bullet.  That's all it's gonna take.
Like what?
I just need a few more weeks,
What'd she say?
Does she know people are trying to kill me out there?
It wasn't my fault!  They just showed up.  It's helping the convent.
I know that.  This isn't about me.  It's about the choir.  You should hear them. They're good.  Really good.  And I taught them.
You mean -- worried about my testimony?
I have?
I've got a show -- at St. Matthew's Cathedral.  We're singing for the Cardinals.
Hey, girls.
People throw stones.  They call me names.  I mean, really.
Then one day they find you.
We're looking for Mike.
It's done?
I figured if you were gonna, then I wouldn't have to.
Mary Clarence, don't be silly.  You're an example to us all.  You've taught us so much.  We're singing for the Cardinals, and then -- who knows?  Maybe the choir can travel -- to schools, and nursing homes.
We can't sing without her!  What should we do?
An... entertainer?
But, Bishop, surely you realize -- this is a most dangerous neighborhood.
I mean, won't she talk? She seemed kind of upset.
Excuse me, gentlemen, but... who has seen this Horseman?
Who took the meat?
Clergyman Steenwyck is calling a meeting.  This time he is determined to have you forced out, or worse.
We haven't heard your name yet, friend.
The wounds are the same.  Cauterized. No chopping or half-measures either. One stroke took the head.  Have you seen, doctor... ?  Even the spinal bone... sliced as smooth as butter.
Stains of blood.
Why not tell us what you have heard? Hmm?  How much have your superiors bothered to tell you?
It is sacrilege!
Your superiors are two days away!
Wallowing in sin and lust...
Wallowing quite literally in blood.
Tell me something.  What becomes of Young Masbath?
Listen to what you say....
Where are we going?
Out there.  What do you see?
It's spectacular.
No, I couldn't...
What does it mean... climb down to the Horseman's soulless place?
Well... I'm one of the few people who likes you.
Someone left last night.  Looked like they headed to the square, but I lost them in the forest.
There is no Masbath here.  My father's loan papers are missing.
What was she doing?
Forgive me, I didn't know.
I've read a great deal about your New York City.  Do be a dear and tell me all about it.  Sounds like an extraordinary place to live a life.
Not all think it is the Horseman. Many say witches come from the Western Woods to steal skulls for their cauldrons.  Some believe a person in this very town kneels before Lucifer, offering death as tribute.  And, still others believe none of it.
Yes, but listen.  The illusion is easily explained.  The eye retains each image, till they combine.  And yet, some would call this toy magic.
Very well.  But, it will only sit gathering dust.
Why would you do such a thing?
I have misjudged you I think.  I did not imagine you were so cruel.
What is it then?  Scientific method? How can any of this matter in the slightest?
Allow me some time.  I have spent every hour in the company of others. I need to be alone.
Lady Van Tassel... she is your stepmother, isn't she?  She bears so little resemblance.
What happened to your mother?  Is she still alive?
Blood.
What... what are you doing... ?
I have not been able to face him yet.
Where are we going?
Quickly, close it.
Excuse me, Lady Van Tassel... Katrina is not in her room.
You cannot kill what is already dead.
What... what are you doing?
Imagine my surprise, finding him on a liason with a common servant.  A girl who had apparently become his secret love.
Go home.
All right then, I'll see y'all later. Karl you done a good day's work. They right about you. Scooter, he's gonna knock you out of a job if you're not careful. I'll see you tomorrow.
Thank ye.
They say you're a whiz on fixin' lawn mowers and things.
Yeah, they's good all right.
Hit ain't got no gas in it.
Thank ye.
Aw, pretty good. Kids are drivin' me crazy and Phyliss is gonna put me in the poorhouse. Can't complain other than that. Wouldn't do any good if I did.  Do you know Scooter, Jerry?
Sixty for small and seventy-five for large.
About a half a mile I think it is.
Yeah.
Yeah, that's right, Frank, you better ask him. I mean, don't hurt his feelin's or anything, but it would be good to know. I'm sure it's nothin'. He seems real sweet.
Okay ladies and gentlemen  or both. It's come to the time in our show when we like to introduce the band. Over here on lead guitar Mr. Randy Horsefeathers. Come on hit a hot lick, Randy.  Well, come on, y'all are supposed to clap now. Come on! 
He don't want to Doyle. Don't go Vaughan if you don't want to. You'll wreck Doyle, you're drunk.
Leave.
Leave.
All right, y'all gonna go with me?
Last time you got mad and run Morris and them off and said to stay away from here.
Now here's the deal. Now that I'm gonna throw my entire life away doin' what I want to come live here with y'all, we have to get a few things straight. See, Frank, me and you mama wouldn't have any problems if it wadn't for you. We'd never have a bad word between us. But since you do exist, if I'm gonna be here as the head of the household, we'll have to live by my rules. And my rules are you don't speak unless you're spoken to. Stay out of my way and do what a regular kid does. You're a weird little shit. I don't get you. So wake up. Face what they call reality. We're gonna be a family now. And it's my family. I'll be payin' the bills so you got me. But I ain't your daddy. You just treat me like I am. I'm the boss, okay. And the other thing is your friend Karl has to go. We can't have a normal family with him livin' in the garage and comin' in the bedroom at four in the mornin' with hammers and shit. See?
I'm a witness. I heard you threaten her life.
What's you last name?
What are all them books?
Why'd you live there?
Do you like to play football?
Hey there. I thought I heard somebody on the porch. Wasn't your name Karl?
Yeah. What you doin' by here?
Well, anyhow, I was just fixin' to go see my mama down at Ben's Dollar Store. She's workin' two till eight.
How did your mama die?
It ain't the truth. He shot hisself with a shotgun on purpose.
'Cause he didn't have enough money to take care of us the way he wanted to. That's what the letter said. He got laid off from work and had to just work odd jobs. I thought he took care of us fine.  Karl, did you really kill somebody?
Who did you kill?
Were they bad people?
I'd like to kill that son of a bitch. I hate him.
It's name's A Christmas Carol.
I was wantin' to ask you somethin'.
I ain't got no money to get 'em with but I bet Vaughan will let me have some of them flowers at the store.
And I don't try to touch her. You know, in a bad way. Foolin' around, sex and all.
I didn't know till here while back a year or two ago when I spent the night with Ronnie Smart one time. He said just tug on your peter and think about your mama. I tried it, but I felt funny thinkin' about my mama. So, I switched over to thinkin' about his mama and then what he told me would happen, happened. It sure tingles, don't it?
I kind of like you tellin' me what to do and not to do. Just like my daddy. I didn't mind him tellin' me. I hate Doyle to tell me what to do. Mama said the only way to ever get away from him is for him to get away from us. That we can't leave him or he'll try and hurt her.
It was alive?
Maybe you can make more sense out of them than I can. I made you a little old book marker and stuck it in that book on Christmas.
Will ye do somethin' for me if I ast you to?
Ever'thing's okay, boy. I kindly want to put my arm around ye for a minute and then I'm gonna go on and leave here.
Hey, Mama. Hey, Vaughan.
Hey Karl, guess what. Mama said you can stay with us. Out in the garage. Our car won't fit in there anyway. It's real neat.
I know he does.
Well, at least he's tryin'. But who knows for how long.
I'm ye boy.
That grass out in the yard's all growed up. I figured I might cut it fer ye.
I reckon I'm gonna have to get used to looking at pretty people.
I ain't got nothing but them books.
Are you sure you're okay staying with that woman and boy?
Yeah.
Hey, Vaughan. How are you, Karl?
You scared me.
Want to sit down? Did you need somethin'?
We sure like havin' you.
Naw, I ain't.
I done et just a little bit ago.
Homosexual. I like men. Sexually.
Karl, what are you doing here? Come in.
Karl, maybe you and Melinda might want to take a walk or something after dinner. It's a nice night.
I didn't mean that.
It's coming along. At the rate he's going, he'll have a story finished by the end of the summer.
What!
And how many people will be attending this birthday party?
Ah-hah, I see. A cozy dinner. But aren't threesomes a little awkward? How does the phrase go--
Will that be cash or charge?
I thought I recognized you. You're Paul Benjamin the writer, aren't you?
Jesus, what happened to you?
What about for you?
Do me a favor, will you?
Definitely.  I suppose it all goes back to Queen Elizabeth.
Do you think I could buy some before you leave?
It's yours?
A photographer ...
What do you mean?
But they're all the same.
Yeah. There she is. She's in quite a few from that year. She must have been on her way to work.
Hey, Auggie, I've just been thinking. You wouldn't need some help around the store, would you? Some summer help while Vinnie's gone?
I'm thinking about the kid. I'm sure he'd do a good job for you.
It's written all over you like a neon sign. Now say something nice to Rashid to make him feel better.
It could have been worse. If the cops hadn't come, I might not be standing here now.
So what did he say when he called?
Nice machine, Auggie. Where'd you find it?
Hey, man, how's it going?
You usually get two.
Yeah, great. The problem is, I have four days to come up with something, and I don't have a single idea.  You know anything about Christmas stories?
I have to pee.  If the waiter comes, order me a corned beef on rye and a ginger ale, okay?
Every word.
You made her happy. And the camera was stolen anyway. It's not as if the person you took it from really owned it.
I wouldn't say that. But at least you've put the camera to good use.
You've suckered me before, darling, remember? Why should I believe you now?
You're conning me, sweetheart. I ain't responsible for no baby.
Good old Frank. And how is fat Mr. Grease Monkey these days?
I told her she was going to meet her father.
Wait till you see her, Auggie.
Jesus Christ. This is all I need.
Still, you can't just write her off.
She's just a kid. There's time for more babies later. After she grows up.
No you're not.
What's this?
There's just one thing I want to know.
Okay. I think everything's set.  You've got the number for Cape Cod, right? Just in case something goes wrong.
It's pretty crazy, don't you think? I mean, a smart guy like you. What do you want to hang on to a dead-end job like this for?
Lovely.
I should stop smoking these damn things is what I should do. The fuckers are going to kill me one day.
A job?  I definitely wouldn't turn down a job.
A little. Not much.
It'll never be finished.
It'll keep them fresh. If they get too dry, they'll break. And you don't want that to happen, do you?  Tobacco is a plant, and it needs the same loving care you'd give an orchid.
Thomas Cole. Thomas Jefferson Cole. My nephew.
I always knew that boy had an imagination, but now he's gone and made up a whole new life for himself.  Do you mind if I sit down?  He's been living with me and his uncle Henry since he was a baby. And we don't live in Manhattan. We live in Boerum Hill. In the projects.
His father walked out on his mother a couple of months after he was born. Louisa was Henry's younger sister, and she and the baby moved in with us. Four or five years go by, and then one day Cyrus shows up out of the blue, tail between his legs, wanting to patch things up with Louisa. I thought Henry was going to tear Cyrus apart when he saw him walk through the door. They're both big men, those two, and if they ever started to tangle, you'd see some teeth jumping on the floor. I guarantee it ... So Cyrus persuaded Louisa to go out with him to talk things over in quiet. And the poor girl never came back.
No, I don't suppose it has. He was broken up like nobody's business in that hospital when he found out Louisa was dead.
Why don't you pick some other spot? It gives a man the creeps to be stared at all morning.
Let me give you some useful information, son. There's two dollars and fifty-seven cents in that cash register over there  and considering all the time you've put in casing the joint so far, you won't make but about fifty cents an hour for all your pains. However you slice it, that's a losing proposition.
It's rundown, all right. But drawing a picture won't improve the way it looks.  Let's see what you did, Rembrandt.
Do you have eyes in your head, or are those brown things bulging out of your sockets just marbles? You've been sitting here all day, and how many cars have you seen drive up and ask for gas?
I'll tell you what. You want to work. I'll give you a job. Nothing permanent, mind you, but that upstairs room over there  -- the one above the office -- is a hell of a mess. It looks like they've been throwing junk in there for twenty years, and it's time it got cleaned up.
Thomas Cole. My name is Thomas Jefferson Cole.
I don't like this. I don't like it one bit.
Be nice, sweetie. We're just here to help you.
Your baby. The baby you're carrying around inside you.
Of course there's gonna be a war. You think they'd send five hundred thousand troops over there just to lie in the sun? I mean, there's plenty of beach, but not a hell of a lot of water. Half a million soldiers. It ain't no seaside holiday, you can bet on that.
Hey, Jimmy. You got the time?
You still have that watch Auggie gave you?
It's okay, mister. No big deal.
Are you sure you don't want some food to go along with it? It might help to absorb some of that liquid. You don't want to slosh around too much when you stand up.
You don't know me from a hole in the wall.
East Seventy-fourth Street.
Thanks, but I'll manage.
I used to have one, but it broke a couple of years ago and I never got around to replacing it.  I'd just as soon not have one anyway. I hate those damn things.
Eight-thirty.
Jesus, do you make a lot of noise. Can't you see I'm trying to work?
The world is going to end pretty soon if you don't learn fast.  Look, why not make yourself useful? I'm just about out of smokes.  Go around the corner to the Brooklyn Cigar Company and buy me two tins of Schimmelpenninck Medias. 
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry... I was trying to reach for one of the books up there ...  And then, I don't know, the sky fell on top of me.
Two or three nights.
You don't have to apologize.  The coast is probably clear now anyway.
Appreciation for what?
Close the door.  Sit down in that chair.  Now listen carefully. Your Aunt Em came here a couple of days ago. She was sick with worry, out of her mind. We had an interesting talk about you, Thomas. Do you understand what I'm saying? Your aunt thinks you're in trouble and so do I. Tell me about it, kid. I want to hear all about it right now.
That's because we don't belong anywhere. You don't fit into your world, and I don't fit into mine. We're the outcasts of the universe.
Let's not get too idealistic.
If I tell you, I might not be able to finish it.
Okay, just a little hint. I can't tell you the story, but I'll tell you what gave me the idea for it.
Uh, actually, I tend to shy away from that kind of thing.
His only copy.  I mean, if you think you're going to die, what's more important, a good book or a good smoke? And so he huffed and he puffed, and little by little he smoked his book.
So you robbed the robbers, and now the robbers are after you.
Well?
Hi, kid.
Fries?
The battery's in, that's done with.  Besides, you'd do the same for m...
$1200 an acre, that's what I paid Ole, won't take a dime less.  You got no choice on that.
But you can't say with any certainty that the blood was his.
And the blood could <u>not</u> have belonged to defendant.  Seeing that his type is O negative.
But back in '34, Japanese-born could not <u>own</u> land.  So...?
And when he came home.  Did he write you about this?  Or phone, perhaps.
What do you mean by 'dirty looks'?
Second question.  What did Ole Jurgensen pay you per acre?
Now, Mister Gi...
Doesn't it seem to <u>you</u>, Mrs. Miyamoto, that your mistake was in being deceitful?  Concealing information during the course of a sheriff's investigation.
There can't be any wrong in this, Ha...
You have to hear this, I can never touch you, Ishmael.  Not once, not ever.  There's no half- way.  As much as I know it hurts you, you have to let this go.
Did you write that column?
Well, what then, sergeant?
So, no...immediate suspicion, no...general talk of enmity between the two.
...comes off third cleat from the stern, port side.  And it's brand new.  Unlike the rest.
So if defendant had tied up to deceased's boat.  With that last one.  Would those cleats have lined up?
And replaced it later with the new one.  That's your inference?
Objection.  Asking witness to speculate about deceased's state of mind.
You're a hard man to trust, sir. You sit before us, with no expression, keeping a poker f...
Well, the freighter.  The twine. The blood.  The knife.  The cup. The watch.  The second battery. The phantom lantern.  The fishing gaff.  The cracked gunnel.  The skull wound.  The blond hair.  That's <u>eleven</u> things...
Robbed.  He was angry.
But Carl was a fisherman.  And successful at it.
I see.  Now what happened the day Carl Heine was found?  Before your arrest.
And you keep the records, or contribute to 'em.
He's looking down.  And he's not thinking 'bout the man you were yesterday.  He's proud of the man you are tonight.  That's what counts.
Now you believe there were <u>two</u> lanterns when defendant arrived. One in Carl's hand.  The second lashed to the mast.
Miyamoto gave him the battery, and left.  Carl's boat was running, he goes back to fishing.  But at some point, he thinks of the lantern...
Then where's the lantern?  And where's the knife?
You think so?
What for, Sheriff?
You must think I like losing.
You wouldn't even see it move.
You think that <u>is</u> the truth.
I think you testified <u>all</u> the lights were on.  Cabin, mast, net lights, picking lights...
And yet you started the engine right up.  With all those lights drawing all night, the batteries had that much charge.  Did that strike you odd?
No spare.
So the defendant went out fishing for the night with <u>no</u> spare battery, hmmn?
How <u>is</u> your mother-in-law?
One D-6 and one D-8 in the well. And a dead D-8 on the deck.
So if his head struck something narrow and flat, the gunnel of a boat, a net roller, a fairlead, could that have...
Can I say something, here?
Are you absol...
Those 'dirty looks'.  Defendant ever aim one of those at you?
The question is more about the <u>defendant's</u> attitu...
Melton, on the double!  Up a chain!                                   MELTON  Sir!     MELTON takes a few easy strides, gracefully catches a chain mid- stride, and smarts up, climbing easily and twice as fast as TODD.     CHURCH, SLOAN, and RUBRICK crane their necks as the two men struggle upward toward the rafters.     Three quarters of the way up, MELTON comes even with TODD, then passes him. MEKUM, watching, smirks.     CHURCH is watching too, and he's still not satisfied.  His brow is knit, something's bothering him.     ANGLE HIGH ABOVE, AMONG THE GIRDERS     Stonefaced, MELTON is resting an a "platform" on the chain, sixty feet up, beneath the girders, swaying gently.     His stony gaze is on the next chain where TODD is arriving at a "platform" on an adjacent chain...only three feet away.     Their eyes meet, TODD and MELTON alone together sixty feet up, three feet apart.  Neither man blinks, neither man flinches, neither man reveals anything at all...     LOW ANGLE, LOOKING UP     CHURCH considers the men high above, then to MEKUM.                                   CHURCH                    What about...spirit?
Okay, doll.
Which of you dolls is Daphne?
Hi, Mary Lou - Rosella - Okay, Dolores, get a move on - How's your back, Olga?
You're welcome.
You girls have seen a brown bag with a white stripe and my initials?
Okay. 
He even got Charlie's last toothpick - the one from the garage - and had it gold-plated.
But suppose he loses?
Suppose Lake Michigan overflows?
Of course, the landlady is going to lock us out - Moe said no more knackwurst on credit - and we can't borrow any more from the girls, because they're on their way to jail -
Yeah - where were you?
With me?
Right.  We have the same blood type...
You've flipped your wig!
It's a hundred miles, Joe - it's snowing - how are we going to get there?
We got to get out of town.  Maybe we ought to grow beards.
How can they walk on these things? How do they keep their balance?
It's no use.  We'll never get away with it, Joe.
DAPHNE?
Done what?
You'd better go fix it.
Bye, Sugar.  We been playing with the wrong bands.
Good night, Daphne.
What's going on here?  Daphne - Daphne -
Male and female - the moth and the flame - I ought to slug you!
Blow where?
So you got pinched in the elevator. So what?  Would you rather be picking lead out of your navel?
Yeah - let her soak.  Come on.
I heard a very sad story about a girl who went to Bryn Mawr.  She squealed on her roommate, and they found her strangled with her own brassiere.
Fat chance!  You call him right back and tell him I'm not going.
And where's he going to be?
Tell him you get seasick on a yacht. Play miniature golf with him.
Congratulations.  Who's the lucky girl?
But you're not a girl.  You're a guy! And why would a guy want to marry a guy?
Jerry, listen to me - there are laws - conventions - it's just not being done!
That's some nerve!
I feel like such a tramp - taking jewelry from a man under false pretenses.
Drop her a postcard.  Any minute now those gorillas may be up here -
What did we do?  Joe, you're not pulling one of your old tricks.
You crazy or something?  The place is crawling with mobsters - gangrene is setting in - and you're making like Diamond Jim Brady!  How are we going to get out of here?  How are we going to eat?
It's all fixed!  Osgood is meeting us on the pier -
Oh - Sugar!
It's nothing.  I just think us girls should stick together.
I'm a very sick girl.
Look, Sugar, if you feel you're coming down with something, the best thing is a shot of whiskey.
How's the bottle?
And bring the cocktail shaker.
See?  She doesn't have one either -  You don't?
We don't have to run.
No, no, Sugar - wait.  I have a feeling she's going to show up any minute.
What do you mean, maybe?  I saw the way he looked at you.  He'll be there for sure.
Brand new.
Just a moment, miss -  May I?
So this year, when George White's Scandals opened, she packed me off to Florida.  Right now she thinks I'm out there on my yacht - deep-sea fishing.
If I promise not to be a naughty boy - how about dinner tonight?
About that roadhouse -
You know something, Mr. Fielding? You're dynamite!
You're leading again.
I called Mama - she was so happy she cried - she wants you to have her wedding gown - it's white lace.
Don't I know you two from somewhere?
Oh?
Good!  Then you won't be needing your car.
Hey, Sig - can we talk to you?
What kind of band is this, anyway?
I wouldn't say that.  Careless, maybe.
Afford it?
Me?
Bingo?
That so?
Yeah.
Oh, I don't care how rich he is - as long as he has a yacht and his own private railroad car and his own toothpaste.
Maybe you'll meet one too, Josephine.
I want mine to wear glasses.
Men who wear glasses are so much more gentle and sweet and helpless. Haven't you ever noticed?
Happy days.
Thanks, honey.
What else?  And was I ever crazy about him. Two in the morning, he sent me down for knackwurst and potato salad - they were out of potato salad, so I brought coleslaw - so he threw it right in my face.
What makes you so sure?
Wait a minute, Daphne.  You haven't got a bathing suit.
I wish you'd make sure.
Well - a group of us are appearing at the hotel. Sweet Sue and Her Society Syncopators.
So do I.  as a matter of fact, I spent three years at the Sheboygan Conservatory of Music.
Why?
And you will come to hear us tonight?
The most wonderful thing happened -
One of whom?
Well, he's young and handsome and a bachelor - and he's a real gentleman - not one of these grabbers.
It looked so small from the beach - but when you're on it, it's more like a cruiser - or a destroyer.
Three?
Oh - in here.
What a beautiful fish.
Harmless - how?
You mean - like frigid?
Well, it was my freshman year at Princeton - there was this girl - her name was Nellie - her father was vice-president of Hupmobile - she wore glasses, too.  That summer we spent our vacation at the Grand Canyon - we were standing on the highest ledge, watching the sunset - suddenly we had an impulse to kiss - I took off my glasses - I took a step toward her - she took a step toward me -
I think you're on the right track.
They told me I was caputt - finished - washed up - and now you're making a chump out of all those experts.
Where did you learn to kiss like that?
Gee, I wish I'd been there.
You're not?
Oh.  The navigator just came in - we're ready to cast off.
Daphne -
You don't want me, Sugar - I'm a liar and a phony - a saxophone player - one of those no-goodnicks you've been running away from -
Embalming people with coffee - eighty-six proof.
You're wasting the taxpayers' money.
Because the day after the shooting you sent in a pair of spats - they had blood on them.
Yeah.  You never know who's going to be next.  Okay, Spats.  Report to the Sergeant- at-Arms.
Hello, Charlie.  Long time no see.
You know what I love about all this?
Perfect. All ginny.
I dont think I can go through with this.
God, Kat! Please. Dont be nice to me. I can take anything right now but you being nice to me.
I should get going.
If Ed ever found out....
Huh?
You heading to the train station?
Theres something about him thats just a bit odd.
I didnt deserve her back then.
Bollocks, Im sorry. I had no idea this would be so difficult.
Brilliant.
Dont patronize me. Theyve clearly been at this a while.
Mmm.
Six thousand, right?
Your friend guaranteed my anonymity.
You shit!
And you thought Id respond to the hippie stripper with no boundaries?
Dont stop asking questions, okay?
I swear. I dont have a signature move.
Come on.
Is this for last night?
So youre telling me. If something had happened last night...it would have cost me fourteen hundred dollars? Thats a down payment on a Ford Focus!
Hello, goodbye, I want you, I hate you. Its all just words. None of it means anything. What matters is what you do. You either stay put or you walk away. If you look back, youre not walking away!
You have had girlfriends?
What would you do if you stopped worrying about what other people think?
You let me make a fool of myself! You lied to me! I dont know why that surprises me because lying is what you do. Its your job. Its who you are. How would you even know if something were real?
Youre right. I was so desperate to make everyone believe I was happy that I spent six grand on a lie. And after all that? The only one who ended up falling for it was me.
Kat Ellis! We live two hundred miles away from each other but I have to fly all the way to London to see you. You havent visited me once in D.C. Where the hell have you been? I have gynecologists that call more often.
Whats he do anyway?
The one I made for you is the cherries. You hang onto it or give it back?
So whyd you let him go?
Im worried. Amys not good at drinking. She gets sooo drunk sooo fast. Does free alcohol get you less drunk or more drunker?  Is it drunker or drunker-er?
I just wanta wash my hand. It's got blood where I hurt it.
You keep looking around, David. Don't you go to school?
It's a good thing your hand did not become infected -- how did you cut it like this?
And you say all them people is dead now?
Here's one by a man that's very much alive.
What about Sounder?
He was real scared nobody would believe him -- I could tell, even when he first stood up.
What are you looking at, out there? There's nothing to see.
But, Charlie --
I see you found what you was lookin' for.
No buts, Rita!
It's cold, Daddy!
If anybody's to blame, it's me -- I oughta nailed him when I took that shot.
Yes, sir...
You had a rough time out there tonight -- so you stay home from that school tomorrow.
Well, looka here...
We didn't find Sounder yet.
Can you say what camp they gon' send you to, Daddy?
Into the clouds and behind the mountains.
And me too, son! You shore done got to be such a big little man!
You bet we is!
Mornin', son...
Dear David, if you are coming to school here, be sure to bring some warm clothes. The school term will begin September 8th, but it would be good for you to be here by the 4th or 5th of the month. I do hope everything is fine and you will be here. Give my "hello" to your family. Yours truly, Miss Camille Johnson...
But, Daddy, you need me here to help you in the field -- Daddy, your leg is hurt -- you can't work like you used to. Who's gonna help you!? Who's gonna do the work, Daddy?!
Do you know my daddy, Nathan Lee Morgan?
He will... Come on, git down and act like a possum.
Mama, there's hot meat on the stove!
You got two shirts on?
Don't take my Daddy! Please don't take my Daddy!
Any sign of Sounder?
What is it, David Lee?
Good night, Mama...
Here's your food -- now you go straight to that place -- if you need to rest, go into a church or railroad station -- but don't go into nobody's house, you hear me?
Didn't see 'im, Mama. The other men there say they didn't know Daddy.
Be good and be smart, little boy.
But I saw you -- you looked in there, and you found out, Miss Boatwright.
But, Miss Boatwright, you--
Don't pout now, David, it's a long trip.
If they heard me sing like this up North I'd be richer than the man I sharecrop for.
Hi ya doin' there, Ike?
Mama, why did they take Daddy away?
You ready to eat?
I just got out here!
I hope you don't take to bitterness, Sister Morgan. I tell you like I tell all the women in this church who got the same trouble you got. No matter what the trial or what the misery is, I tell 'em to stay with God.
Oh but OF COURSE children are going to see it!!
YOU JUST DON'T CARE!
BECAUSE IT'S EVIL!!
Good. Now 'Pillow'.
Well, anyway... Today children, our friend Mr. Hat is going to tell us all about the environment.
Eric! Did you just say the "F" word?
WHAT DID YOU SAY?!?!
Fuck that!  AGAGH!!
Ze alarms! Zey went off!
Dude, that movie was fucking sweet!
Suck my balls.
No, I know. I'm just fucking STOKED I don't have to pay him!
Who the hell made up that law?!
Hey Cartman.
Did you bring the pie and punch?
I know Cartman, I know.  I see Kenny every day.
CARTMAN!
Mph rmph rm!!
Mrphmmmph!!!
Oh you poor dear. You've been through so much...
What? Fuck French people. Fuck 'em in the ear.
Mkay.
Oh yeah.
What's the secret to making a woman happy?
Oops, I guess you haven't got that far in your anatomy class, huh?
Donkey raping shit eater.
What do you mean?! I could leave him if I wanted to!
Mph rmph rm rmph rmph rm!
Kyle, you take your little brother out to play with you!
Boys, we have to have a difficult discussion.
Who is it?
So... We must free more Canadian prizoners?
What's a butfor?
Hey, dudes... Aren't you supposed to go to church, Kenny?
That was sweet!
<b>Thank my lucky stars Here before me now Is everything I'd ever hoped for Knew it in a word Saw it in a glance The only thing I think I'd die for...</b>
Woa, dude, who's your girlfriend's new guy?
Dude, let's help Terrance and Phillip!!
Whoa!  What the hell was that?!
Okay... I just need to find a few private message boards...
Dude, do you know what you're doing?
Wow, a lot of people showed up.
Whew, I'm sure glad that's over.
Oh Lord, what have we done...?
What about air strikes?
And Bill?
SILENCE!  I AM SATAN!
What did my son say, Principal Victoria? Did he say the S word?
Terrance and Phillip MOVIE?! Oy gevalt! Not again!
<b>Shut your fucking face, Unclefucka!! You're an asslicking, Ball sucking Unclefucka!! You're an Unclefucka, yes it's true Nobody fucks Uncles quite like you-</b>
Hello, Conan!
Good one, Phillip!  Cheers.
What's going on Terrance?
Well of COURSE he wants out of hell! The whole POINT of hell is that you don't WANT to be here!
If you love somebody then you treat them with respect!  You've never respected me!
Ow, you're hurting me!
We saw the Terrance and Phillip movie!
Nothing, Stan. You wouldn't understand.
What is it?
You don't have watches?
Anna...
Uh, yes I am.  And you are?
So...
Well, so we are.  Sure is beautiful, huh?
Well, it was nice meeting you. Enjoy the rest of the trip.
Yes he did.  Yes he did. Barnes looks at the monitor - Taylor and the others are still in the dining room -
And what are they doing now, Mac?
No, I just ran it!  Why are you running it again?
Barnes, can you hear me, are you all right?
Now do you want the good news first or the bad news?
I don't know what you're talking about!
Idiot...
Well...I don't mind.  I can put up with it.  I'm taking six months off after this, and I won't have to deal with people snapping their fingers at me.
Well, more power to you.  Me, I start to bug out after too much time out here.
And suppose you couldn't hold out?
It must be oxygenated if we can hear him.
If I could get to the bridge I could send the distress signal.
A little dab'll do ya. Now you know how to get there, right?
And what are you going to do?!
But you can't be sure!  It's suicide.  You have to come with us!
Right now it's about 8 o'clock at home.  People are going to work, kids are going to school...
What is it?!
Thank you.
What is happening around here!!!
Where's Taylor?
How is it going to be different from this?  Go see some boring footprint under glass?
You're Delbert Miles!  You have more clout than some whacked out pilot!  Talk to him!
Look.  We're talking about life and death here.  I don't know why we're even having this conversation.
Ok Mac...  I'll talk to you on this. I want to find a way to get to the bridge, then I want you to come back.
How is it looking, Mac?
Yeah, but it didn't go so good. He wasn't the man I thought he'd be. Theo is trying to affix the lid on his cup, but his hands are trembling, spilling some of the coffee.
Paradise, huh? Might be one of the new putt-putts off route 99. Theo turns to leave.
I don't know no Buzz Fazeli.
Sorry about your loss.
Your pop said to put these on his tab. Sid gets up and jerks his thumb towards the door.
Bowling was the most incorruptible sport. No megalomillionaires, no 
Did you know you were parked in the handicap space?
The Faz sure took care a her.  Breeze makes a nasal GRUNT as he tries to suppress a snigger. Sid - trying to keep a straight face - elbows him. Sid and Breeze approach the coffin. Breeze pulls an orange whip out of a paper bag and carefully places it on the coffin lid.
Sure, around here, any fat old bald guy could be king. I'm nothing. It wouldn't do any good for me to talk to the Congress.  Hey, you thirsty? You like orange whips?
Who gave it to you?
If the Japanese are pansies, then pansies are my kind of people. Sheila steps over to the booth with their food. The Buzz Burger has three holes cut in the middle to make it look like a bowling ball. Buzz sees the two sleazeballs park their car and walk towards the diner.
That's a laugh. You're all strung out. You're a bowling junkie.
What about bowling?
So, eh, you never saw me. Right?
Son?
My poor baby!
Don't tell me, John.
It depends.
NO. I SAY KNOCK-KNOCK! You say who's there. I say who's there and then you say who who. You're not playing right.  Knock-knock.
Come on Sheila, knock-knock.
I have someone for you to play Blueface with Junior.
Hey, enough fun and games. We have work to do. Come on Junior. Kastle heads for his car. Junior gets up and follows. The two sleazeballs tarry as Theo stands.
That's some pinfall. Almost a 133 average. Her ball's flat, she needs to work on her spin control.
What if he wants to get out?
After we eat, Dad.
You're just like you mother! Always jealous!
Hello, Mr.Kastle.
Like this?
He's not here.
This is a sign! Someone's coming to take Buzz away from me. I don't know if you're the guy or what, but I'm not letting it happen. I'm leaving him first.
Then I'll have the number four with one of your finest whips.
Here Theo, it's the Fazeli specialty; a seven-ten split. Theo looks down the lane and sees the two pins standing.
What does he do?
Mind if I cut in?
Unfortunately what he wants is you.
What's plan B?
What do you think my dad's gonna do for you?
What? Be my body guard?  Here's my body, Theo. Guard it. For my dad's sake. For your career. Sheila starts to unbutton her bowling shirt.
I don't think your new outfit suits you, Theo.
I'm a credit card junkie. I went on a binge and my dad bailed me out. Now I'm trapped in his easy payment plan.
How much would you charge me for the lips?
You professional men drive a hard bargain. I'm afraid I only have five on me. Sheila pulls out a 5 dollar bill.
Then it's true, isn't it? About...
I'm sure you wouldn't care if he needed your help, right?
And besides, it's probably too late, anyhow.
I can't - I can't do it.  He's my brother.
These open the back door. Don't let him catch you behind the machines; if he does, you're trapped. I'll meet you at the bridge. Theo takes the keys. Sheila grabs his arm.
It. Bouncy-bouncy. Fucked. He tried to squeeze my fucking head off. What did you say to him? When they reach each other, they stop. Sheila seems to weigh her answer.
Can I come with you?
Why did you come back?
My word is good, and it'll always be good. When did I ever give my word to you?
Fuck plan C!
You think I'm dumping you to get back into bowling. Well who's dumping who?
Who identified the body?
Let me out, Captain.  Open the door!
Fletcher, get away from there...
Not everything.  Even on earth.  Take ... yeasts.
Norman!
They told me about sixty hours.
I'm not sure.  I've never seen anything like it.
A squid?  The size of a whale?  I don't think so.  Target acquired.  Sixty yards.
Don't pull it, Norman.  It'll start a <u>fire</u> we can't stop.  Norman?
Don't do it!
Anything else?
You talk to any reporters?  Any press?
Off the record, I don't mind telling you, this thing scares the shit out of me.
They pressurize us with helium.
Picked up something?  What is it?
Harry's missing.
You don't want to know.
He translated it wrong.  "My name is Jerry"?  It's like "See Spot run."
You don't think weapons are important?
Damn it, Edmunds?
You think he killed Edmunds?
Going active.
Subs are still at surface, sir.
Norman, get out of there now! Norman?
It's chipped.
Ted?  Captain?
You don't know that.
It's a single sequence repeated over and over.
I have to tell you.  It's strange.
I'd also like it noted --
Some sort of lead or something.
Time travel.  I always thought it was one of those myths... like Santa's reindeer.
I want a name.  A real name.  This thing's full name, rank and serial number.
It won't register.  It's too big to image.
Resetting the sub.
Do yourself a favor, Norman.  Are you listening?  Don't tell anyone what you just told me.
To the spacecraft.  To investigate.
Well, let's pray that's the only mistake you made.  Have you said anything to Barnes about this?
You're next, Norman.
400 years ago?  I'm sure Christopher Columbus would've loved these accomodations.
It could breathe in air and exhale cyanide gas.
Where'd this come from?
Me?  Well, I was wrapped in seaweed. It itched for a while, but I survived.  Beth, do you find it... curious that we're seeing all this life down here.  Nothing, and then these enormous flocks of squid.  Then jellyfish?
Nobody said... Norman...  What?  Why are you looking at me like that?
I didn't do anything wrong.  I didn't mean...
... He lied to us.  He left us down here.
"Although advised of risks, all personnel elect to remain down for duration of storm to continue investigation of alien sphere and associated spacecraft.  Signed, Barnes, USN."
Don't tell me to calm down!
You said something to him, didn't you?
It's not worth the risk.
You should know how it works.  Just in case.
The sub's a 100 feet in front of you.  You see it?
... what do you mean?  I'm in the ship.
Fixing it?  But I fixed --  Where'd you get all that?
He acquired some sort of power.  A power to manifest things.
Looks like some sort of code.
Diphenyl parlene.
Nothing about drowsiness.
Parasolutrine?
It's an idea.
To be on the safe side.  I mean --
It's getting cold.
What are they doing down here?  In the bathroom?  Suddenly appearing.
Then why, Beth?  Why go in?  Why put out explosives?  Why manifest the snakes?
Beth you're losing it.  C'mon.
You're insane.
I never went in that sphere.
That's bullshit.
I promise --
It's your choice.  Because it's not safe for you to be awake.  To be walking around.  To be thinking about things.
Oh, sure.  Here.  Anything else, Beth can get you?  Some more chicken, perhaps.  Let Beth check the fridge.
Would it work?
Then what is it?
Take politics, our views on abortion, the death penalty...
Jerry.  Right.  I said Jerry, didn't I?
I'm sorry.  Slip of the tongue.
Why are you looking at me like that?
Don't be defensive.
Go ahead.  Ladies first.
C'mon.
Nice work, Norman.
And we're just talking about three- dimensional creatures.  What if it's five or six or seven-dimensional?  So dimensional that we couldn't even see it to kill it.
So, <u>we know</u>.  We know it went through a black hole.  We saw it.  Norman -- when we'd get to the surface, we'd tell someone about the black hole, wouldn't we?  It'd go in some report like some big discovery.  So in fifty years when they build that ship, they'd make precautions for a black hole.  <u>But they didn't</u>.  The called it an Unknown Entry Event.
Look -- we're under a lot of pressure, we're tired, you're not thinking straight.
What is that?  That noise?
She was supposed to be watching the sensor for me.
It's the squid!  Stop it!
Her legs are in the way.
Get her out of the seat, I need room to sit.  Harry?
Less than a minute, we're never gonna make it.
There is one possibility.
The power allows us to manifest our fears, right?  What if we feared the power to go away?
A spacecraft half a mile long -- with 500 tonnes of coral on top of it?  Someone went to a lot of trouble.  Try again.
All the facts you need are right in front of you.
Meaning it didn't land in the water.
Norman Johnson.
That whole time -- I couldn't stop thinking of what Harry was saying earlier...
No other equipment?  Scientific instruments?
He wasn't feeling well.
You want me to try?
Well, how about we wait and see what Harry comes up with?
You think Jerry has something to do with what killed Edmunds?  With what's out there?
Well, I can't imagine five years of unemployment --
I'm Han Solo, Captain of this vessel.  Who's in charge then?
Well, we'll see...
We have to find he rebels... What we're carrying belongs to them.
Luke's got a point... ... Fear is their greatest defense... I doubt if the actual security there is much greater than on Aquilae or Sullust, and what there is is most likely directed toward large-scale assault.
Don't look at me.  I'm just a pilot. I got you here... You've got to do the rest.
I... I'm not a Bendu Officer.  I'm not even a startrooper.
You saw through me?
I assure you my intentions weren't bad.
I'm afraid I've gotten too old for this sort of thing.
You were right.  It is my responsibility.  The Force of Others brought the message to you and then it brought you to me.
It surrounds you and radiates from you.  A Jedi can feel it flowing from him...  ... from here!
Luke, I'm coming along to do what I can, but I'm tired and I'm depending on you to get us through.
We don't have that kind of money. How much do you think I can get for the speeder?
What's wrong?  What's happening?
Of course, where you been kid?
Have you been checked out?
Put that thing away or you're going to get us all killed.
What about us?  Are we to wait forever?  Is our reward to be blown to bits on this forsaken system, while your fleet mounts some suicidal attack on that Death Star? Part of my reward is that I be around to spend it.
Who's the pilot?
Well, I practice a lot...
I don't pick up any life form concentration down there.  She'd better be right.
You'll check the condensing unit first... and you're not going to bed until those 'droids' are completely cleaned up...
What happened?  I'm sorry, sir, I must have taken a bad step...
I can't make it.  You go on, master Luke.  It doesn't make sense for you to risk yourself on my account.  I'm done for.
I think we're going to need them. Blast it!
See Threepio... do you copy?
Holy Maker, Threepio.  I forgot...
Wanting it doesn't make you the best one for the job.
We got reinforced. Most of'em just got outa boot...
We'll take this high ground. Lookouts there and therte and up there. If the bugs come upstairs in this neighbor-hood, we'll be the first to know.
Do you freely admit to the charges made against you ?
Sir, I wish to reconsider my request to drop out, sir.
You still haven't kissed her yet ? Don't lie.
Yeah, but I want Carmen.
Johnny, I'm sorry it had to be your unit on Planet P. That mission had a very low survival probability...
So what are you doing later ?
Hey ! What are you doing here ?
I was thinking. Maybe we should get married, Carmen.
So ?
Carmen...?
Where are you going ?
Well, if that's the crop, that must be the gastric caecal...
Who cares about bugs ? You can't go anywhere if you don't know math.
What's he got against me... I mean, I 'm a teenager. You can't be a citizen when you're only a teenager !
Well, if your dad doesn't like me, how come we're such good friends ?
Johnny Rico, you're jealous !
Poor boy. I'm sorry your parents were so mad.
It's funny. Sometimes I forget. Then it hits me, and I can't stop crying.
I thought you were KIA, Johnny...
Almost got knocked out of the sky over Big K.
Good work, Number 1. You'll do.
Hey, Rico, wanna dance ?
Can't we just be friends, Diz ?
What's your malfunction, Rico ?
Well, see ya.
Way to go, amigo !
Hey, Diz...
What frequency ?
I bought the farm, didn't I, Johnny ?
Johnny, people get hurt... people get killed in the Federal Service. If something happened to you I don't know what I would do...
Why did you go and do that ? He was all ready to go Zegema Beach !
You'll resign, and that's all there is to it. It might look bad, but if that's the worst you suffer...
Take your group down to P and have a look see. Leave the thinking to us, Lieutenant. That's not your job.
Seeing as how we're about all that's left of  1st Brigade, you'd have to call that an improvement.  You top kick ?
You knew the Lieutenant before the war... What was he like ?
Which do you think is more important, courage or confidence ?
You got something to say about the Mobile Infantery ?
How bad are you, pal ?
What is your position ?
The exact words of the text. But do you understand it ? Do you believe it ?
Well, my parents are against it, and I know it's my choice, but I was wondering... What would you do if you were me ?
Yopu asked me some advice once, Rico. Want some now ?
Sergeant, secure the boat !
Why does V'ger travel to the third planet of the solar system directly ahead?
<U>Why</U>?!
They have repressed the Creator.
Our data is being prepared.
Within you are memory patterns of a carbon unit. If I can help you revive these patterns; you could understand our functions better.
Sir! Airlock four has been opened; a thruster suit is reported missing!
Tractor beam strength lessening, Captain.
You'll stay aboard as Executive Officer... a temporary grade reduction to Commander.
Stop competing with me, Decker!
Captain, we've seen what their weapons can do. Shouldn't we take every possible precaution -- ?
That's precisely the point, Captain. We don't know it will do. Moving into the cloud -- at this time, is an unwarranted gamble.
The ship is under attack...! Man all defensive stations...!
Captain... this probe may be a key a key to the Aliens.
Then V'ger believes the Creator to be a <U>machine</U> too.
Jim... he <U>wants</U> it.
Hello, Ilia.
I now the Captain meant no person- al insult.
Navigational deflectors inoperative...!  Directional control also inoperative, Captain...!
Was he difficult?
Lieutenant Ilia reporting for duty, sir.
And in you, too, Lieutenant.
Mr. Spock?
Mr. Sulu, steady as she goes.
Clear the bridge, Captain...?
Do <U>not</U> return scan, Mr. Spock! It may be misinterpreted as hostility!
No vessel could generate a powerfield of this magnitude...
That vessel is generating a forcefield measurably greater than the radiation of the Earth's sun.
We cannot break free, Captain.  We do not have a fraction of the power necessary.
Bridge, cancel rescue teams.  Spock, what in the hell are you doing out here!
Were you right? Spock? V'ger is a living machine...?
Captain, the orbital device will      not be triggered for twenty-two       minutes...                           
V'ger plans to literally <U>meld</U> to reduce both itself and the Creator to patterns...
Twelve! I'm on my way to a meeting with Admiral Nogura which will not last more than three minutes. Report to me on the Enterprise in one hour.
That object out there is less than two days from Earth, Mister Scott. We've got to intercept while it still is out there!
Engineering... Status, Mr. Scott?
You bringing your new friend?
You're doing a <u>Play</u>...
...small town.  I suppose.  You have to make your own fun.
Northern Books.  What can I do for you?
I want to rent this one.
Ever wonder why the dalmation's the symbol of the firehouse?
That, he says, there <u>are</u> no second chances...that he's been presented what he <u>prayed</u> for...and: he's ruined it.
Goodbye.
The, the, the, the <u>sanctity</u> of everyday things...
For example, he's just come back from a <u>fire</u> and he...um...  That's a fine house.  You look at that, and you know, there's nice people that live there.
...such a pleasant sound.
Cause, cause, it's...it's the <u>simple</u> things, that...
But how do I...how do I do a film called "The Old Mill," when I don't have an old mill?
<u>How</u>...?
No, I don't...
Tonight, tonight, I...I have play practice...
Hello.
Uh huh.
"Rise, one need not bend the knee before the throne of justice."
Great.  Who is it...?
Would you put on your cl...  Just leave it outside.
And here's some hydrogen peroxide.
Hi.
"To the love of my life, Love, Doug"?
Oh <u>okay</u>.
Ah.  Ah.  Ah...
No, that's true.
Yeah, you?
I've been thinking: look at this: we live up here...
...and we could get up every morning...
And come to the printshop.  You know <u>why</u>...?
But it'll stop the movie.
S'Okay, Maude.  You know your lines...?
Well, I for one, am glad of a little diversion and I'm glad they're here...
We did...?
It's all over between us, Doug, I'm sorry, but that's the truth.  I've found someone else, and, it's very serious and it's the end.  I'm sorry.  It isn't <u>you</u>, j...
I'm sorry.
He works on the movie.
I'm sorry.
I know em, I don't know what order they come in...
But, does it have to be an Old Mill?
What's an Associate Producer credit?
It'll hurt the box office.
Rewrites that Bob Barrenger requested... the "dead horse scene," the...
A jacket for five dollars...I can buy this town for fifty bucks.
...why am I here...?
Waterford, Vermont.
I will.
They think it's your First Wife...
Whyn't you learn your lines?
I saw Desert Sun, I wanna tell you...
What do you drink?
...wouldn't that be dangerous?
Her...
What else?
The people came to see a motion <u>Picture</u>.  ...hold on...
Tell it with...
You don't need "Hi I've just come from the restaurant."
You do...?
I have to ask you these...um.  You have a valid drivers license...?
I've got scene <u>twelve</u>...  Shouldn't you be in school...?
It's a mistake.  It's all over.  I'm sorry that we've inconvenienced you.
Get him on the phone.
I want you to hear this.
You have no right to...
Matzoh!  Are you Jewish?
I love Jewish men.
What, what's there to <u>think</u> about?  The scene's perfect...I, I get to say...
What...?
I know that, Claire.  I, we <u>all</u> know...
...<u>no</u>, they don't...
And you know what...?
I, uh...  I've always thought so...  Well, you just get an idea, and try to find the best way to express it in pictorial form.  I've written a letter to the studio and to SAG protesting...  Bill: get a copy of that letter...!  I just wanted to tell you that I am <u>past</u> chagrined, I'm <u>mortified</u> at the way you were spoken to...
...yes...
Claire:  As an interpretive artist to a creative artist:  Stay with me.  I need you.  We start to shoot tomorrow and then it belongs to <u>us</u>.  Stay.  Stay.  Tonight...when...  When they've gone.  Let's talk.  Let's <u>really</u> talk.  We could, we'll have <u>dinner</u>, we'll...a bottle of some bad red wine, we'll get spaghetti, and we'll...
No, are you kidding me, Bob, not at all.
Somebody make a note.  I want Li..., for the broad...what does she like?  Lilacs. Okay.  A truck of lilacs when the broad comes.  And get something for Bob Barrenger, get him, what does he like...?
Oh, really, then why don't you sue me in the World Court.  Did she like the costumes?
What?
Aren't you supposed to set an example for people...?
...I just swore my life away, back in that...
...he's the producer of the movie.
He didn't have to tell...
Hi.
What's in the case?
My wife's going to have a baby.
He saw the accident...?
We can't shoot in the Old Mill.
You told me they had an Old Mill here..
I...
...the finest people you could ever hope to work with...  You have the new Old Mill pages?
Does it have to be an Old Mill?  Where have you been?
We're out of money.
I know the feeling.
I want to make a good film.
What's the...
Then you're finished in show business.
<u>Siddown</u>!
Well, you call him, and call me back, but this is it, pal, you <u>fuck</u> with me, and I'm going to tear out your heart and piss on your lungs through the hole in your <u>chest</u>.   And the best to Marion...  Where have <u>you</u> been?
You can't write it?
You didn't see it...
What is that...?
What's in all the bags?
I'm gonna' bring it off.
How are you getting on with these fine people?
Eight hundred grand to show her tits...
I got a company...give us a million dollars, put their product in the film.
Well, I've enjoyed it, too.  Any... any...<u>any</u> time...  What does the woman want from life...?
IT'S A COMPUTER COMANY...IT'S A COMPUTER COMPANY, <u>BAZOOMER</u>-<u>COM</u>?
We got the permit.
Yeah?
The chairs go, the Lazyboy goes...
Zat true?
We need a new name for the movie. Where's the writer?
Lord Nelson, Napoleon's troops.  I fear for the women and the property values.
Scream.
I'm a little tired and it's just a pick-me-up.
Well Daddy and I are just friends now, and that's no reason not to wear mascara...
But we do have a choice.  To make it better.  Instead of worse.
...I mean, she knows all the music, and pop stars, and clothes and stuff. She's like still a kid, herself.
I know how scared <u>I</u> get when <u>you're</u> sick.  So I waited to tell you.  Until it was getting smaller. I thought that was best, maybe I was wr...
I could help with the debate.
You don't like his friends.
This'll work, huh?
How many devilled eggs can you eat?
Darling, I've been thinking about our little Brad problem?  And I think it's time we move to Plan B...
I don't have to listen to you!  You're not my mother.
It's not to wear around, or any- thing, I'm <u>way</u> too young.  It's just for play.
You know what that creep and his frogfaced footmen are calling me <u>now</u>?  In front of the whole <u>world</u>? Frosty, the Snow Bitch!!
You think this is funny?
June 3rd, God willing, I'll marry your Dad.  And then I <u>will</u> be your stepmom. And right now, I'm not looking forward to th...
Oh, baby, I'm so sor...
And you<u>don't</u> tell her.  What you're going to say.
Help me here...
In high school.
The guy <u>I</u> see is in the eighth grade at <u>Prep</u> School, and he laughs his <u>ass</u> off every time we talk about you.
You know, this horse smells really bad.
Oh my God.  That is so not funny.  You're late.  You're really late.  Now get out here and have some cereal.
But you told us to starve.
Excuse me --
&quot;In the great green room there was a telephone and a red balloon...&quot;
Does Rachel make a lot of money?
I think she's pretty, Mommy.
I'm somewhere, thinking of you.  And meatballs.  And you know what?
ARE YOU CRAZY, YOU COULD <u>SUFFOCATE</u> IN THERE!!!
Mommy's sick, guys.
So you're okay.
In the still...still of the ni-ight...I held you...held you so ti-ight...
I've got a lot of medicine in me, sweetie.  And I'm a little wobbly for driving or running ar...
Find the bird cage?
The world.  <u>Thinks</u> I'm gone.  But only the magician.  Knows better.
You say that like I don't know that.
People beat it, don't they?  All the time.
Why would his worry?  Or my children's worry.  Or anyone's worry.  Help the sit...
You can't <u>do</u> that, I won't <u>let</u> you!
Napalm.
You ask me that counselor's making a mountain out of a molehill...
Me too.
Jackie, you've made mistakes -- We all make mistakes --
You know the kids aren't really in danger.  This is about Rachel, and you're right, I'm disappointed in her learning curve, and...
You're still going to have to be dealing with me -- with us.  We should tell them together.
She's a charmer, you'll see.  In fifty years, the kids'll love her ten percent as much as they love you.
Yet another spaghetti night.
I know.  I wouldn't know what to say.  If it were you.
We don't have any coffee.
What happened with Annabelle?  Has nothing I said gotten through to you?
Did you or Luke talk to her about it afterwards?
Jackie, if I thought for one moment...
...in.
Bandaids for cuts.  Bandaids for new shoe blisters.  Packet of Wash n Dri's. Kleenex.  Sugar free lollipops, potty seat covers for public restrooms...
I'm sorry, I just...
Uh.  Have you told Luke and the ki...
They came out of my <u>body</u>!
Okay, I'm undeserving.
So I have to tell you something in confidence...
Oh, my God.
And you said...?
Can I look at the pictures?
So.  Hopeful.
That thing you said before.  Pushing the guy sleeping next to you away. Because of what you gave up for motherhood...
Now we're going to have a fight, you and I.
And I'm going to win.
You are <u>defending</u> what you did?
You put filth in my child's mouth.
And there will come <u>another</u> moment. When the stakes are <u>really</u> there. And she will look back on this.  And remember how good it felt.  How easy it was.
Thanks for coming out.
What's this about?  Because we <u>fought</u>?
I love Luke, I love the children. But there is more to life than even love...
I never wanted to be a mom.  Then, sharing it with you was one thing. Carrying it alone, the rest of my life...
Everything.  You're...the Earth Mother incarnate...
You know every story, every wound, every memory, their whole life's <u>happiness</u> has been wrapped up in <u>you</u>, every moment...
You know, there's nothing you have to say.  Because they know your heart.  You don't have t...
You'd rather spoil our walk home.
Anyway, I thought...while I'm gone...maybe I'll hire in some help.
You don't need to.  I don't expect you to handle them yourself.
Oh right...So it's just complicated for you and Jackie -- for me it's pretty simple cause I just don't understand...
Oh my God.  Are you serious?
She's not gonna die.
What a great surpri...
Why in the world would she t...
Can we go sit somewhere?
I told her I loved her.
Restless.
That's a pretty ugly thing you just said.
'But keep dancing, and if you're lucky, I might just never leave, who knows?'
Where you goin'?
Out! Leave the table!
Hey, Scooby! How's it going?
Nice to have you here.
Ahh...tell me. What do you want to do for me? What's your idea?
But do you really believe in God? And heaven, hell and angels and all kind of stuff?
Hmmm.  But, Consuelo, even though your poor, don't you have any hobbies or interests or anything?
Yes, you are. I can tell. What's the matter?
How did they execute him?
Maybe it's for the bestI mean, if he was guilty of doing  something wrongPeople who are bad should be killed. Don't you think so?
Consuelo, what is rape exactly?
I'm not making fun. I'm showing it as it really is.
This is entertainment you're making, Toby. This story about a kid in the suburbs and the state of the college admissions process has, with this Brady crisis, evolved into something much richer and more provocative.
I mean, without this footage, without this rigorous documentation, it would feel like exploitation.
It's all about who you know.
We did the same thing last year also.
Hi, Scooby! How was school today?
Hey, you want to hear my short story now?
What the fuck are you talking about? What's OK?
Reconceive.
Fuck!
I don't think there's any hope, either. I was just trying to make you feel better.
Yeah, uh, listen. Why don't you go upstairs and keep your Mom and Brady company for a bit? I need to speak alone with Consuelo for a moment.
Yeah, um, then...are you alone?
You're not.
Oh.  Do you think I have a potential as a writer?
It's over there.
Nigger, fuck me hard!!...
OK.
I dunno...
Well, I mean...I wanna be on TV. Maybe have a talk show or something. Like Conan. Or early Letterman.
Toby -? Oh, hi! How are you?
Great!
Oh, that's too bad.
That's too bad.
Yeah. You didn't wanna take me to the prom.
I do.
Uh, well, anyway, so I'm looking for subjects for this documentary on teenage life in suburbia. Kind of an exploration of the mental psyche of its mythology. I wrote to Derrida to see if he'd like to do the narration. But everything's still kind of in development at this point.
That's good.
Yeah. But not any more.
Huh. Kids?
Pretty cool, Stanley.
Hey, um, Toby? I was wonderingIs the documentary almost finished?
What is most important to you?
I don't know what hit us!  We had them trapped on the stairwell.  They could be anywhere now.
We got trouble.  That bodyguard son- of-a-bitch has them running all over the field--just took out three on the north end!
Just get me a coke and don't argue with me, OK?
Cooper...
I drew my gun, ran in the direction of the cries...violating the first rule of service...I let the Ambass- ador out of my sight.
I'm going first.  Taking the fire. If we go out together we're all dead!
I have a lighter!
Enjoying the tour so far?
Well?
And--of course there is the human cost, which is incalculable.
Apparently, this project is--unique. But it's heavily protected--all formulas are heavily codified!
Of course it's codified!  Each number probably corresponds to a compound.  Have them pull every compound from the lab and compare it to the codes till you figure it out--that's what you're here for.
I want the girl.  I don't care about the rest--but a US congresswoman taken hostage will make for great copy. We'll make headlines all over the world...
Our traveler's insurance, you know what I mean?
Good.
Agreed--let's move it.
Well, there was uh, a little dissent about the amount of the bonus--
Of the separate chemicals--I don't know, uh, offhand--
War-mongering bully!  Don't think you're going to intimidate me!
Damn you, de Sade!  You know as well as I do that this was the act of a mentally sick man - a single individual, whose crack-up can probably be traced to the strains and tensions caused by your country.
Please, Mister President, I am extremely shy and do not wish to endure this sort of personal humiliation.  Here is the only other camera I have left. 
You must think I'm an awful sap, Major.  Just sit down, fella, and keep your hands on the desk!
Okay, fella.  But just move slow and don't do anything that might surprise me.
So what?
Go back to sleep, baby.
Does the threat board show anything?
May I be stupid enough to inquire WHY IN HELL THE BASE COMMANDER OF THE 843d BOMB WING DID A THING LIKE THAT ???
Well, sir, they may not allow the Special Service troops to enter the base.
Under the circumstances, General, what would you think they should do?
What do you suppose is going to happen if General Ripper's planes start bombing their targets?
Youddon't think I'd ask if you recognized my voice unless it was important, do you, Major?
That's right.  I want this flashed to all section immediately.
Yes, Major.  This looks like it's going to be it.
Major, that's all I've been told.  Just got it on the red phone.  The base is to be sealed tight.  And I mean tight.
No calls from inside out.  No calls from outside in are even answered.  No calls.
You're a good officer, Major, and you're perfectly right to bring these facts to my attention.
You know the regulations well, Major.
That's a good question, Major.  Maybe if you think hard, you can think of the answer yourself.
General Ripper, can I ask another question?
But when they do, sir, won't they hit back with everything they've got?
But then why do you want to kill a hundred and sixty million of our people, sir?
Well, I know they've been going on for years, and they haven't gotten any place.
I don't know, sir.  But they're just as anxious to avoid a nuclear war as we are. War just doesn't make sense any more, for anybody.
Go on, Major.
No, Major, I don't.  They have no regard for human life.  They wouldn't care if they lost their whole country as long as they won.
Do you think we'd cheat?
Major, those are my boys out there dying.
That's right, sir.  But the planes were at their Positive Control points, ready to turn around when General Ripper issued the final Go-code.
We don't operate like you KGB boys.
Have you received acknowledgements from every plane?
I'm not certain, Mister President.  But I believe it was four.
How do you know they were shot down, Buck?
Yes?
You've lied to me twice - I'm sorry, but it will be strictly routine.  These men are experts.
Yeah, to see if we're on our toes.
I've got the heading, Major.  One-three-eight.
He's right.  They must have clobbered some of our cities already.
A through H is correct.
Check.
Forty-five.  Still coming straight and fast. Twelve o' clock.
Why can't he help me now?  He's sitting two feet away from me!
Look, I'm shot - it hurts.
If they come down low enough to make a firing pass, they'll never be able to pull up in time.
Sorry, King.  My leg's stiff as a board.
Lieutenant Toejam, are you ready for Bim and Bam?
Where'd they get you?
What does it look like?
Yep, it's the CRM-114 code, all right.
Gee, we hate to leave you like this, Major Kong.  But there isn't anything we can really accomplish by sticking around.
Listen, King, old buddy.  On behalf---
Shoot, Lothar.
What's your point, Lothar?
Are you saying our order don't make sense?
Fusing for ten thousand air burst.
Can't "Ace" help you?
I don't know what we got left besides Bim and Bam.
You sure have to hand it to those guys.
I mean pulling a stunt like that.
They must have gotten it from the base. No one else would know it.
That's the point.
I said that's the point!
I'm okay.  What's up?
There's no other way, Lothar.  Can you re-arm the bombs for impact?
Well, you shouldn't drink. Are you gonna drink?
It's called "Burger Manifesto, Part One The Dialectical Expression of Testosterone." Isn't that a great title?
Typical male.
No I quit.
A cloud.
Yeah. There was this cloud and I video taped it.
Stuck with what guy?
But, so, Pony's comin' by here to the corner?
I don't know. Later. I don't know.
That sounds so great, man. Yes. Yes. Hey, what would you do in the afternoon?
So, do you guys want to do something, go someplace or something like that?
You know what we should do? Go to the...
Hey! Whoa, you look like shit. You been home yet?
Hey. Hey. Are you trying to get a hold of Sooze?
Good.
Yeah.
No, I know what you're going to say. I don't know anything about making a video. But that's a plus.
Yeah, that's what I'm trying to tell you. That chick Erica?
What she doin' in the van, man?
What?
Bullshit.
God, Tim lied to your ass, man. That guy's sad, man. Well, uh, I gotta go, but, uh, listen, if I don't come back, I'll send a video of me surfing. Alright, man? Get some rest. Go with the flow.
Ah, you know people there?
I don't think I like that guy's attitude at all. Hey, you know what? Take off the blades. I mean it. I'm gonna break your fucking legs. Take 'em off.
Hey! On behalf of Burnfield, I present to you the keys to the city.
Oh, you were in the band?
Your his publicist?
Oh, my God, you found it. Thank you so much.  Did you get your tape?
You better! Yes!
He paid you man.
Hey, we're just having a conversation.
Pakeesa? It's okay. Come on. It's okay. Come on, they're just joking around.
It's okay.
Hey, yes! Hey, Pony, man! Great concert tonight!
You know what would be cool is, like, to do a music video, you know? But, like, you know, have it set in here. You know, like, like, like, with her and shit. You know, like, you know, like, "Closed, closed, closed, closed, closed, closed."
You could do it.
Yeah!
Hey, play that demo again, man. Alright.
Hi.
Thinks he is. Well, he is.
Yeah. So, what about you?
You just seem to know all these things about me and I don't know anything about you, you know. What kind of music do you like?
"It's not a job, it's an adventure." Right? I hated it. I had to get out. So I was working in the kitchen, chopping lettuce, you know, real heroic stuff, and I, uh, I had this big fucking knife and I chopped off the tip of my little finger and three days later I was a free man.
Deep down. Way down.
Great.  Hi. I'm Erica.
Two-fifty.
Uh-huh.
What? What the fuck do you know about the third world? You been there? No? No, well, I have. Fuckers live like sardines in a can over there, you know. Everything stinks. It's true, there's no, you know, law, no order. No nothing. The assholes come over here, they think it's gonna be the same.
If it's all so fucking futile, what the fuck are you so fucking upset about, fuckhead?
I mean, you know, at least I admit that I don't know. I know that things are fucked up beyond belief and I know that I have nothing original to say about any of it, alright? I don't have an answer. I don't have a fucking message.
Oh, no, no, no. This is no big deal, you know? I can come down and, and get you out.
What'd you do?
No, no. That's not the way it is at all. No, I stayed up all night trying to figure out how to protect my best friend. Wait, yeah, no, I was trying to come up with some lie so that you wouldn't have to go to jail for the rest of your life.
Yes.
Why? Because I give a shit?
What about my feelings? What about my fucking feelings? These assholes, they come over here, they know all the answers, right? Well, they don't know shit.
Tim, can we go? This is ridiculous.
Jeff! Come up here!
Why we're just standing here.
You know, this, what you're doing with your life...
No, wait, wait! Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! What is your name?
Your sure as hell right about that.
No, no, no. Y-you know what? Y-your packing your bags, you're jumping into the unknown because some conceptual artist who teaches at a community college is having a mid-life crisis and he wants to sleep with some girl half his age, so he tells you you have talent.
Your completely missing the point.
I stand for honesty! I stand for some level of truth!
Can I talk here? Let me talk.
Can I talk?
Okay, what would you have done.
What feelings?
Taking one community college course on the history of Nicaragua, while barely holding a job packing boxes?
So I can spend the rest of my life guessing what it would be like to be a real artist?
Yeah, but that doesn't mean that your tree is not artistic if no one cuts it down.
No, I don't.
Come on.
Mm. I enjoyed the ride. Sorry you didn't.
What?
What about us? I'm moving away your staying here.
Go.
Good, man.
Yeah.
The prom. That's funny.
No, you know what? It's not you, man. It's not anybody. It's me. Whoo! Hey.
I'm sorry. I, I gotta...
You know, why do you call me names? You know, I never hurt you. I'm only working here.
Look, get down now, you fucking drunk! You bum!
No, no, it isn't. It's cool.
Yeah?
You do not!
You do not want me to do your cover.
Would I get paid?
Yeah. Burnfield, Pizza and Puke capital of the world.
What's that supposed to mean?
Yeah, you know, when you called I thought, there's a name from the past.
"Don't write any checks you can't cash."
Okay. You know what? Watch your fucking language, alright? Or I might have to.
No, see, Neil, if you're fucking with one of my friends, then you're fucking with me.
Yeah?
Just one?
I don't, I don't remember. What do I owe you?
Ew! Oh, Buff! Relax!
What?!
I can't believe your grandparents never come down here.
Who are you - the goddamn Bionic Woman?!
This is great - GREAT!  Now we have to enter the front door!
NO-GAH-BUH- NO!  Rule number two - NO NAMES!  NO GODDAMN NAMES, you retard!
Di, are you okay?  We can skip the girl party this week.
Thanks, Cleo.  See you tomorrow.
Diane?  Diane!
Positive.
No.
... I don't know.  Probably not.
But, we have to make a smart plan!
Well, if I had to guess...  I'd say that was the sound of a mother saying good-bye to her little boy and hello to a young man who's going to be a daddy of his own...  Jack, do you know what I see here?
Like Cocoa Puffs.  Good.  Captain Crunch.  Bad.  Shreds the roof of your mouth.  I mean you hear, "Tricks are for kids!"  And you think, "I'm a kid, I guess they're for me."  But your baby brain's got no idea that Fruit Loops are, like, a million times better.  I'm going to save our kid all that pain.
Jack, I think I should get a job.
Nope.  Sounds more like the first.
Hat-trick?
Oh, thank G-d!  I'm not just super fat!
No.  This is Diane.  I think you have the wrong number.
You want us to help you pick up?
Hannah, we've...
Screw Lucy!
Are you girls talking about boys? Practicing kissing your hands?
Oh please, we've all got bright futures ahead of us - we're not going to tell anyone.  Promise!
...so, while it's a laugh riot for the whole family, and Tim Conway is just about as funny as they come, especially when he goes...
I'm only allowed "G" movies.
All of you!
I don't hate you.  I need your help.
Your help.
I know - that's what I said too. Anyway, we want to help her get some money for the baby by robbing a bank.
I hate to think where that puts me.  I could be her father.
Give me your coat.
Say, you're not really smuggling opium these days,  are you?
Good party.
Sure, this'll go on all night.
Wait a minute.  This is the woman I love.  What's going on? Who was loaded?
Hello, Mr. Sheldrake.  On that Bases Loaded.  I covered it with a 2-page synopsis.  But I wouldn't bother.
Just a rehash of something that wasn't very good to begin with.
Name dropper.
There's one called....Window... something with a window.
I had a teacher like that once.
You won't.  I'll get us a refill of this awful stuff.
Stop it, Artie, will you?  Where have you been keeping your- self? I've got the most wonderful news for you.
I called your agent.  I called the Screen Writers Guild.  Finally your old apartment gave me some Crestview number.  There was always somebody with an accent growling at me.  You were not there.  You were not to be spoken to.  They never heard of you.
Dark Windows.  I got him all hopped up about it.
Sorry, Miss Schaefer, but I've given up writing on spec.
It's not your career -- it's mine. I kind of hoped to get in on this deal.  I don't want to be a reader all my life.  I want to write.
What about all those ideas you had?
Check.
Look, if you don't mind, I haven't got time to listen to the whole plot ...
Good for you.  You've got yourself the best guy in town.
So do I.
I'll say.  This is solid gold.
It's that old familiar story, you help a timid little soul across a crowded street.  She turns out to be a multimillionaire and leaves you all her money.
Look at this street.  All card- board, all hollow, all phoney. All done with mirrors.  I like it better than any street in the world.  Maybe because I used to play here when I was a kid.
May I say you smell real special.
Hey, what's the matter... Betty, wake up!  Why are you staring at me like that?
All right.  I'll give you a few more clues.
Come on where? Back to a one-room apartment that I can't pay for? Back to a story that may sell and very possibly will not?
Hello, young fellow.
Norma, I want to apologize for not calling you.
Did you see them? Did you see how they came?
That's what I want to talk to you about.
It's got a lot of good things.  Of course, it would be an expensive picture...
They're dead.  They're finished. There was a time when this busi- ness had the eyes of the whole wide world.  But that wasn't good enough.  Oh, nol They wanted the ears of the world, too.  So they opened their big mouths, and out came talk, talk, talk...
Just a minute, you!
Are you or aren't you?
What for?  I can say anything I want with my eyes.
What month?
Sagittarius.  I like Sagittarians. You can trust them.
You know, I'm pretty expensive. I get five hundred a week.
Now, now, don't let's be small about such matters.  We won't keep books.  Go on, unpack Mr. Gillis' things.
Cut away from me?
I need some money right now.
Now what is it?  Where's the fire?
Joe,  you look absolutely divine.  Turn around!
Not on the same floor with Valentino!
Who? Some car hop, or a dress extra?
Go away.
Why don't you just say thank you and go, go, go --
You're really going to send it to De Mille?
Did she read the script?
Where are my cigarettes?
Don't you want to come along, darling?
What about the studio? What about De Mille?
I made your bed this afternoon.
That's what I told them.
Why?  Her career?  She got enough out of it.  She's not forgotten. She still gets those fan letters.
And she's turned you into a servant.
We've come for the car.
Got a title?
Of course, we're always looking for a Betty Hutton.  Do you see it as a Betty Hutton?
Could I?  Gillis, last year some- body talked me into buying a ranch in the valley.  So I borrowed money from the bank so I could pay for the ranch.  This year I had to mortgage the ranch so I could keep up my life insurance so I could borrow on the insurance so I could pay my income tax.  Now if Dewey had been elected -
Forget Romanoff's.  It's the car I'm talking about.  If I lose my car it's like having my legs out off.
Did the deceased ever threaten you? Were you in fear of bodily injury?
Paramount studios.
Oh, yes, yes.  They're below, waiting for the Princess ... I'm ready.
I'm an artist, Alura. My work comes first. Other people come second.
What does it mean?
Oh, fiddlesticks. What could be dangerous about a baseball game?
Bianca, try not to be so bloodthirsty when you're at the wheel. OK?
What's happening?
Let me out. I have to talk to you.
You're alive! She didn't kill you!
That woman who's after me. She hates you. Because she knows I love you.
This is my favourite place in the city.
But be reasonable. If I don't do something to stop her she'll try again. And maybe hurt you.
We're from different worlds.
Let me kiss you.
I don't love you any more.
Because you remind me of all the dumb things I said.
And now?
Wait. Don't leave me.
Hey! Ethan!
Hey, I thought you were gonna mention us upstairs.
They think I have a concussion.
I know it.
Guess! Go on.
Do you have any theories about last night?
Oh, Jimmy, can't you forget about your career for one second?
I saw them dragged out of the Administration Building.
I can't help it if men notice me.
Superman will return it.
Be brave, my .daughter. Be wise.
What's a tree?
My cousin Clark is my only relative on Earth.
Why is he acting so strangely?
Lucy; come back!
I'm afraid I have some bad news about your car.
Don't you believe in knocking?
That ought to keep you out of my hair for a while.
You've run out of things to throw, Selena.
Others?
That horrible woman!
Zaltar, please help me.
There's no way out of the Zone. No one's ever escaped. That's why they send the criminals here.
Then teach me how.
Leave the zone? What would I do on Earth?
What's that? Never saw anything like that.
What?
Aha! What'd I tell ya!
Brad is not a good name for a cocktail.
Man, you don't never pass out, do ya?
All the kid needs is a couple of pointers from the ol' champ here.  Kent, I bet you didn't know I won the all-country bowling trophy two years in a row.
Lana Lang. How great to see you.
You look wonderful.
Mayonnaise? Donald loved mayonnaise. Why would you think that was the problem.?
That song. I remember one day I came into the music room and you were fooling around at the piano. And I thought -- what am I going to do with all this potato salad?
I just can't stand this.
Me??
No, all the good ones are married. That's why Brad thinks he's God's gift to women. This woman anyway. He's single. He won't take no for an answer, but he's the only one who's asking. And he knows it.
No, what you said before, Could I make it in Metropolis? I've dreamed about it, sure, but I never really thought about it.  What would I do when I got there?
Mr. Kent! Superman was here!
Do you really know Superman?
Anyway, the reunion's just the hook for the story. What it's really about is how the typical small town's changed in the last fifteen years. how do you like this a title: Can You Go Home Again ?
So, Mr. White? Can I go ahead and make my travel arrangements?
It's practically an American ritual, Mr. White! Isn't that so, Jimmy?
The thing is though, my cousin Arnold, Aunt Rosey's Arnold this is, he got mad when Uncle Al insulted his mother's stuffing, so now the problem is --
Wow, what a beautiful sunrise!
Name?
Ah yes, August Gorman. Have you looked for work this week, Mr. Gorman?
Mr. Gorman, according to our records you have been unemployed for 36 weeks.
Sonofagun! Look at this here!
Actually, it's probably more like $143.80 and one-half cent.  There's always fractions over in a big corporation, but they round it down to the lowest whole number.
No, not really. They can't be bothered collecting half a cent from your paycheck anymore than you could.
Now me, I was born rich. I've never worn the same pair of socks twice.
I believe they're laundered and sent to some charitable institution. I don't know what the heck they do with 'em. Maybe they use them for dust rags, or pen wipers...
Man, what is this?
Under different company names. I control the price of coffee beans in Brazil. The price in Venezuela. Java, South Korea, North Korea, the Aleutian Islands, Guam, Bolivia, and the Republic of Gabon!
Wipe 'em out?
Just hold on a minute. I have been doin' some thinkin'
He sure wasn't actin' bad and nasty that day in Smallville. Man, he was so full of niceness I was startin' to feel funny about layin' that chunk of...
Is this blackmail?
Not like this one you ain't. Nobody in the world got one like this 'cause it don't exist yet. We got to build it.
I invented it, man. In my head. It's a stone killer-diller get-down get-it-on and twice-on-Sunday super mutha computer.
Everything.
But a machine this powerful is going to make powerful enemies. People who will want to destroy it.
Awright. I got me my electric train, mama. I finally got --  Hey, what y'all doin' up there?!
Thanks.  Let's go
Hey listen, I didn't know your mama was comin' by...
Through the telephone line terminal, that ain't nothin'.
What about you?
Oh. I'm Lana Lang. This is Ricky.
Never.  I get air-sick. You wouldn't like that.
"At a special session of the General Assembly, 178 countries voted to censure Superman. With only Columbia abstaining." ROSS That fella's becoming a public menace.
I can't see anything.
You! Activate circuits 29 through W7 and start Full Power Coordinates on Exterior Defensive Systems:
I can't! It's out of control!
Okay? Goodbye.
Computers talk to other computers, right?
Don't you see? Okay, so you didn't kill him. Nobody's perfect. But that stuff we ran up in the lab wasn't a complete failure after all.  Right after Gus gave it to him, Superman started to turn into a selfish, ornery, malicious, conniving...
And now that Superman's out of the Nice Guy business...
That's it! The last tanker! They're all mine now! All...
Are you okay?
Lois, I usually do.
I don't?
Clark, everything I was saying -- can't you see I only say it because I really care?
I don't know, they look pretty happy to me...
Hey, are you hungry? I'm hungry.
Lois, I don't have the vaguest idea -- as usual -- what you're --
Who ????
I was right. you are Superman.
"What's happening." Oh, is that the understatement of the year. Well, so . . . where do you want to . . . talk?
Clark . . . it doesn't matter . . . we can move . . .
Maybe we ought to hire a bodyguard from now on.
I know, I know all the arguments, you don't have to tell me. That's what I did all night -- I "listened to the voices of  reason" till the dawn came up. Do you have any idea what a vile sound it to hear the first bird singing when you've been up night crying?
Does Lois know about this yet?
A good time! Is that all you care about?!
Genius!  --  Lex.
It has everything.
Artemis? Do you read me?
Mr. White, the pressroom wants to know how much longer to hold the front page.
Game plan! It's fourth down and long yardage, the two-minute warning sounded and the ball's deep in our territory! How brilliant do you have to be?!
You have been given a higher form of happiness. The happiness you feel by serving others, by inspiring them to --
-- as the keeper of the archives of Krypton, it falls to me to tell you of the darkest episode in our planets history.
Don't feel bad, Mr. Luthor. It almost worked. I mean California almost threw up right in the ocean. Millions of people almost killed. If it hadn't been for that guy Superman - that overgrown boyscout...
DELETE IN CUTTING
Where?
Shhhhhhh!
Perhaps there is some good in you after all, Lex Luthor.
Which one would you like to join, Luthor? Pick a hole.
There will be no attack? No attempt to overpower the terrorists?
Look, they need a machine to fly.
This "super" man is nothing of the kind. I have discovered his weakness.
But you're perfect for it. You're young, you're single, you're successful...
You're late. Very late.
Oh . . . no, there's no one back home.
Then prove it. Lois is doing an interview with Superman about his peace mission . . .
Gee, I don't think . . .
Oh . . . my . . .
Gee, I'm really sorry.
Daddy's offered me jobs at some of his other companies. But, I've been thinking maybe I'll take some time off.  I'm going to find a place like Smallville, in the country. Maybe a  farm . . .  see what the slow lane is like.
. . . Please leave your message at the beep.
It's just a bad flu, really. How did you know . . .
Boys, old Lex has a secret recipe in this dish . . . call it a genetic stew. You help me place it on one of your missiles and I promise you . . . if Superman throws it into the sun, he'll get the biggest surprise of his life. I'll be able to introduce Superman to his first nightmare . . . a Nuclear Man!
Didn't we have our little talk about personal involvement with the help? Now that you're the publisher . . .
But all men like me, Lois. I'm very rich.
I think there's an angle.
I know I'm not exactly a Girl Scout but . . . maybe if I show him I'm trying . . . he'll like me.
But he's never there.
What's he going to say?
. . . I look at you, Lenny, and I know how the Romans felt when the barbarians arrived at their city gate.
Gee, Uncle Lex, I don't think this guy's much of a dancer.
Gee, Uncle Lex, I was just getting to the good part.
What was that about?
He's . . . cold. . .
You think he'll find us.
I am an experiment? I am freako?
Me? Now? With Superman dead and you on my team? It's like I'm the coach and you're the best power forward ever. What could I have to fear?
If you have any social skills, you've learned them from a rattlesnake. Just what are you up to?
Look closely at his cell structure. See anything familiar?
Your time in prison has twisted you into a delusionary state, Luthor.
Ah! The guest of honor at last! And about time, too!
But Mr. Luthor, sir, I already  --
Yes, so, well, Werner would've gotten to that too but  --  --  but the XK101 flies only eight feet above the ground...well below the radar limit!  So what? We could have done that soon. We had ways to make people ta-- ways to avoid the radar. And this XK101  -- they think it's so smart that they keep it in 'missile silos' underground. Hah!  We kept many things underground.
You and Lois, you get all the action.  There she is, out in the wild West and everything.
She's in California. That's wild enough, I guess.
Don't worry, Mom. I know.
Mother...
I'll bet you have some good ideas.
Not...gray.
Some people aren't the athletic type.
Thanks, Clark, but I'm booked for the night.
I'm telling you, I was there.
Why would he do that? How would he know I was going to suddenly slip.
Listen...thank you.
You! The girl from the volcano!  Kryptonite...
What are you doing here?
Why does it all mean so much to you? All the time, 'land, land, land.'
So I've noticed.
Streets, Sunlight. When was the last time I saw sunlight.
What's the temperature now?
Some people can read 'War and Peace' and come away thinking it was a simple adventure story. Other people can read the ingredients on a chewing gum wrapper and come away with the secret of the universe.  Y'know.
They stop for nothing.
She knows. Clever, very clever.  And unappreciated. But I'm going to take you away from all this.
I don't understand.
Danger??  Somebody??? Lex  -- where are you going?
You can't do this to me!
My friends, I am not a rash, impulsive person. I'm not given to wild, unsupported 	statements. We must evacuate this planet immediately!
Two.
It's a ...baby.
Yes, true. But on other worlds there would be other problems - heat, cold, no life, no life support systems...No, Lara, believe me; Earth is the least of evils. On Earth, his lighter gravity will render him almost weightless - that can't be helped. But with his denser molecular structure, he will also be strong.  He will be fast, He will be virtually invulnerable.
Here's the story on that East 19th Street murder spree. Page one with a banner headline seems about right to me.
Who...who...
Oh, I've got to get some matches.  My cigarette.
Oh.  Well, where do we start?
How old are you?
What color underwear am I wearing?
Where do you hail from?
There.
I gave him this new face.
Please...
Well, gents? What did I tell you? It's a piece of cake.
Yes...fine.
I'm glad to hear that Zoe's okay.
Not really.  The last time I saw her was at that clinic.  That was a long time ago.
Which one?
So there were others?
Then...when did she get better?
What...does it turn to?
Alison.
I don't know.
No.  I mean, I remember Mrs. Ansel wearing some of this stuff, but...I don't feel funny about that.  I really liked her.
Well, it being so depressing and all.  But it's reality.  You can't just turn this off because you happen to think it's a bad idea.
It's not enough.  For hospital bills.  For Nicole.
Nicole's coming over to look after the kids tonight.  She'll be there around six.
I stopped by the station a while ago.  I stared at the bus.  I could almost hear the kids inside.  There was a lawyer there.  He told me he'd gotten you signed up.  Is that true?
Mr. Stephens says that someone didn't put a right bolt in the bus...
I have to.
Is it true that you gave Nicole one of Lydia's dresses?  That she was wearing it when the bus crashed?
Those are all from the fair last year.  Abbott and me were judges at the pet show.
Billy loved to see his kids in the bus.  They always sat in the back, so they could wave to each other. It comforted him.
Abbott and I used to do a lot of that in the spring.
That's right.
What do you mean?
It's clear to me and other people that you have suffered significantly from this event.
Excuse me?
That's what he said, is it?
It's for the school bazaar.
But Dolores said she saw a dog and tried to...
Is this mine?
Is he coming over now?  Right away?
Can I sit beside you on the bus tomorrow?
That's right.
Because...he wanted to them to be punished.
Dolores.
Why?
I object to the form of that question.  Note that.
What do you mean?
Tell me about the Ottos.
Yes.
They're smart.  Been to college. They moved here from the city about a dozen years ago.
Need a hand?
Is this it?
Yes, I'll accept the charges.
That's not news, Zoe.
Do you know what that means, Daddy? Does it register?
Do you have the blood test?
Some more wine?
I'm sorry for coming over unannounced like this, Mrs. Otto, but the Walkers said you would understand.  I know it's an awful time, but it's important that we talk.
You think someone else caused the accident?
Are you a reporter?
How does the family survive?
Yes.
I will offer that report.  Well, then, now that your memory seems to be clearing, can you tell us what else  you observed at that time?
This is before the accident, Nicole. Do you understand what I'm asking?
How fast would you say Mrs. Driscoll was going?  To the best of your recollection?
Did you say anything to Mrs. Driscoll?
You're going to blow everyone away.
The door needs a lock.
Well, yes.  He's your lawyer too.
You're going to need special care for a long time to come.  It's not going to be easy.  Not for you, not for any of us.  Because we love you so much.  And it's going to cost money.  More than we can imagine.
Are you sleeping?
Will the police do anything to her?
Yeah, well, they probably smoke weed.
How are you tonight, Mr. Falco?
Hello, Sidney.  Wanna table?
I want to speak to Miss Hunsecker, please.
I could think of better places to meet her, instead of here.  He lives on the whole top floor.
How is dear old J.J. by the way?
Friends call me Otis - sometimes Tricky Otis.
Take it easy, Susie.  He wouldn't be much of a man if he didn't understand my concern.  Would you, son?
Just exactly what are you so hot about?  I mean, I know it's a difficult thing to be an artist in this crudest of possible worlds, but --
Frankly, son, you lost me on that last hill.  Just give us the punch line...
Susie, as always, is free to say anything she thinks.  Go on, dear, say exactly what's on your mind, dear.
May I lift my eyebrows?  What is this?  What are you trying to do?
If looks could kill, I'm dead...
And what have I done to her, besides not buy her a new fur coat lately?  Sidney, you were right -- the boy's a dilly.
Susie, you're very much in my thoughts today.
Then whose fault was it, J.J.?  It was someone's fault, wasn't it?
There is some allusion here that escapes me...
Hello, Harry.
Yeah.  At Bellevue.  Still hanging on.  But they still don't know if she was pushed.
Awright, that brings us up to five weeks ago. "Sidney, I got a nasty little problem here." Did I say no? I'm frank to admit - it don't jell as fast as we like... But all of a sudden I CAN'T GET YOU ON THE PHONE NO MORE!  WHY?... And why, as of this date, am I frozen out of the column...
I'll do it, J.J. - don't get me wrong - in for a penny, in for a pound.  I'll see it through, but stop beating me around the head. Let me make a living!
Uh huh.
Let's forget cats and dogs and other pseudo-literary remarks--- I'll just lay it on the line!  What about that big rumpus in my office today?  You were there, Frank! Where, according to St. Dallas, J.J. was responsible for the Elwell smear!
Sidney, I told you -
I know...I know you're the strongest cop in town.
It's nice, Sidney, that you give me this tip...
I thought he would.
Don't you ever get messages, Eyelashes?  I called you twice.
He was writing a special Sunday piece on...?
Sidney...I...I don't do this sort of thing...
What would you think of me if -
Pay the rent.  Let the tailor wait.
If that's for me, tear it up!
You're talking very fast.
Frank, you don't listen!  J.J. just told you to shut your mouth!
Give him credit---the boy's gall is gorgeous!
You're touchy, Sidney - don't be so touchy...
Feels like a Monday night, don't it...?
It's given me a big lift to know that some people want me for myself, not just because I'm my brother's sister.
I hope that J.J. really likes Steve, that it isn't an act.
I know that bit - you're a girl; you need a man to give you strength! So what do you pick such weak sisters for?  Don't you know yet that you fight fire with fire, not with tear drops?
Jimmy!  This is a coincidence.  I am just going -
Hello, Steve.  I'm glad you could come.
Baby, this thing is going to blow 'em all away. It's a neural-net process --
Please... let... the kids... go...
Do you have bandages?
Radical.
Jesus... you were gonna kill that guy!
How long do you live?  I mean, last?
You will.
Why do you cry?
Pain causes it?
Alriight!!  My man!
Killing Dyson might actually prevent the war.
I'll deal with the police.
So she's pretty cool, huh?
Out of the way, John!
We're better off by ourselves.
I don't trust it!  These things are hard to kill, John, believe me, I know.  We may never have this opportunity again.
Mom?  You okay?
John, get out of the way!!
I know.  This is a dream, Sarah.
I know!
You said I could be transferred to the minimum security wing and have visitors if I showed improvement in six months.  Well, it's been six months, and I was looking forward to seeing my son.
You broke my arm!
My CPU is a neural-net processor... a learning computer.  But Skynet presets the switch to "read-only" when we are sent out alone.
In a few months he creates a revolutionary type of mircoprocessor.
On Furtwngler.
Oh! And don't wave your hands about!
And no elbows on the table!
I'm very sorry.
David. David Wills. I'm your liaison officer with the Allied Kommandatura Cultural Affairs Committee. Sir.
I guess so, sir.
Where you from, David?
Isn't it true that before every concert you got a woman in your dressing room and gave her the old conductor's baton, isn't that true?
What?
When you question him again, could you treat him with more respect?
Major, show me someone who hasn't made an anti-Semitic remark and I'll show you the gates of paradise.
So, Major, tell me, have you questioned Dr. Furtwngler?
I was in Vienna. I had with me an Austrian chauffeur, Max his name was, he spent time in the camps. We were looking at these Viennese cleaning up the bomb damage, scavenging for rotting food, butt ends, anything. I said, 'To think a million of these people came out to welcome Adolf on the day he entered the city, a million of 'em, and now look at 'em.'  And Max said, 'Oh, not these people, Major. These people were all at home hiding Jews in their attics.' You get the point, Colonel? The point is they're all full of shit.
This is what I'm saying. He must have had Party contacts.
And suddenly, Steve, suddenly you notice that they like you. They honour you, suddenly you are the director of the best museum in the world, for example.
Says here because of your father. What's that mean?
Mine's the Eleventh.
I'm kidding, Emmi. What about a record player? You have that, too?
Major, Major... he's here ...
I can't do this. It's not right.
Could you tell us about being made a Prussian Privy Councillor. How did that happen to a non-Party member?
What about Vice-President of the Chamber of Music, you used that title didn't you? But then I suppose you had no choice there either, because I suppose Dr. Goebbels just sent you a telegram saying, Dear Mr. Vice-President.
That sounds like the small print in one of our insurance policies, Wilhelm. And what about April 19, 1942?  The eve of Hitler's fifty- third birthday, the big celebration; you conducted for Hitler, didn't you? Was that in keeping with your view that art and politics have nothing to do with each other?
Tough, tough!
Why were they going to arrest you?
So, how did you learn that the Gestapo was out to get you?
Steve Arnold...
Who?
How?
It is now nine o'clock precisely. I do not intend to be kept waiting again.
Maintain liberty, humanity and justice.
I believe art and politics should be separate, but that they weren't kept separate I learned to my cost.
What telegram?
I have no idea what you're talking about.
We never, never officially represented the regime when we played abroad. We always performed as a private ensemble. As I think I already told you, I was a freelance conductor.
Von der Null?
Von der Null?
Well. Once he said he'd read what this man wrote about me.
Please stop playing these games with me. Why you should bring up the name of another conductor is beyond my understanding.
I absolutely refused the house and the bomb shelter.
Okay, Wilhelm, go home now. Go home and think about these past twelve years.
I believe that. But just answer the question, don't give me explanations.
Do I know Hans Hinkel?
Do I know Hans Hinkel?
Great catch, kid. The boy runs off.
What?
I've remembered something else...
Furtwngler sent Hitler a telegram for his birthday.
And ask him about his private life.
Oh! The evening before, I see...
Well, they say here that when you went on a case, you stayed on it.  Now we can't take every Nazi in this country to trial, although I would like to; it's an impossibility. So we're going for the big boys in industry, education, law, culture.
I have your questionnaire here. It says you were never a member of the Nazi Party.
Dr. Furtwngler is a great musician. He actively opposed the Nazis and later on he helped many Jews to escape.
Yes, that's true, but he refused to give the Nazi salute. He kept his baton in his right hand. In Hitler's presence. That was a brave act...
Aren't I worth waiting for?
Can you handle it?
Not lately.  Did you check messages?
You must have a girlfriend.
Compared to me she is.  How come you're not at the cash anymore?  They catch ya steal- ing?
So, it's from the future, is that right?
Kyle, what's it like when you go through time?
You volunteered?
Sleep.  It'll be light soon.
About what?
Thanks a lot.
That's where we're going.
Didn't you say that they're going to develop this revolutionary new thing...
Kyle?
I'm dying for a shower.  You could use one too.  And we'd better check that bandage.
What's that?
My whole life has been combat.
It'll never be over, will it? Look at me, I'm shaking. Some legend, huh?  You must be pretty disappointed.
That's not what I meant. Was there someone special?
So much pain.
I don't think I like this.
And who was the enemy?
I didn't build the fucking thing.
Why were the other two women killed?
You've heard enough.  Decide. Are you going to release me?
I can help you...
Okay, let's see...Got a pos- itive on her.  She's Sarah Connor, works as a legal--
That stuff's two hours cold.
Call her.
Same shit.
I'll be done in a minute.  You misspoke before.  You're not "stepping down."  I'm taking you out at the knees.  The whole point is to prove that you're not deciding anything anymore.  I'm firing you. Action's taken.  Confidence restored. Stock goes up.  I sell my shares.
I, uh... haven't been to Sunday school in years...
Christine!   Mister Van Orton is a valued customer...
It's run by a company... they play elaborate pranks.  Things like this. I'm really only now finding out myself.
There's got to be a flashlight.
Home.
Long story.  I found this key in the mouth of a wooden Harlequin.
This isn't an attempt to be gallant. If I don't lift you, how are you going to get there?
You're the one who started running.
That one did.
Where are we going?
The maitre d' called you Christine.
I'm tired.  I'm sorry, I should go. I've been enough of a nuisance.
I could've handed you to them.  They find me now, I'm dead...
Who are "they?"
They did the same to him as they did to you.
Why else would they be willing to put you under... ?
What are you <u>doing</u> here?
Get us out of here...
Think about it!  They followed you every step of the way.  There was always a safety net.  The taxi, there was a diver.  At my house, the window was rigged... they shot at us with blanks...
It is.  It's what you hired us for. Nobody touched your money.  Nobody stole anything.  They're waiting on the other side of that door with champagne... all your friends... it's a celebration...
Like what... my favorite color... ?
No.
Happy Birthday, man.
They gave me a free jacket at the door.
They make your life fun.  Their only guarantee is you will not be bored.
What are you doing?
Calm down.  Why would they keep playing after you paid?
It's them.  They did this.
Do you know how to change a tire?
Because you hate me.  Because you had to be here, when mom died.  Because you had to do it alone.  Well, don't you think if I'd known... I'd've been here too.  I'd have been here...
It would mean a lot to me... if you and I could be friends.  If I could have you back in my life... in some small way.  It would be important.
I'll explain someday.
Happy Birthday, Nicholas.
Oh... it's a game.
Look, it was just a job.  Nothing personal, ya know?  I play my part, improvise a little.  That's what I'm good at.
You don't need me...
Where?
Guess!
Didn't I give you two?
Thank you.
You did?  How is he?
All the time I've known you, you've never once asked about him.
What's the trouble?
What's this about?
There were complaints by other guests, and damage to his room.  We did the best we could to accommodate his behavior.
He couldn't, or refused to pay.  We extended credit...
Anything wrong... ?
Nicholas...
Someone's playing hardball.  It's complicated.  Can I ask a favor?
Illegal surveillance, reckless endangerment...
These old Victorian houses are great, aren't they?
And what kind of sleeper?
Modelling small-group dynamics in the formation of narrative hallucinations.  You brought us here to scare us.  Insomnia, that was just a decoy issue.  You're disgusting.
That could have been worse.
Luke, can I talk to you?
And those are Luke's and mine.
I didn't do it.
You used the wrong test.
Are you working with her?
I, I just can't...
I have a bad feeling about what you're doing.
Nell.  Good enough.  And I'm Jim.
Let's say it wasn't you.  Who did it?
Welcome Home.
What happened?
Get a blanket!
She needs help.
He's wandering around the house, and Nell heard him.  She thought it was ghosts.  Let's go look for him again.
I'm not going back to New York City.  I'm going to find an apartment with a little flower garden, where you can just see the ocean and at night, when the wind comes in just right, you can hear the sound of the harbor.  What about you?
Is there something about the house?
That's where she hanged herself.
What did it cost?
Wait.  You're not wearing that ironically?  This is really you?
No.
Yes.  I feel realy rested, too. Theo?
How could he have left without his keys?
Watts?
Theo... Did you?
My place isn't like yours, Nell, it doesn't have a view of sea.  It doesn't have a view of anything. What's interesting about the way I live is what goes on inside the walls.  Living with me... My boundaries aren't very well defined, Nell.  Do you know what I mean?
Oh, Theo.  You know I don't have an apartment.
Not for you, clearly.
I'm not into finger foods.  Too fussy.
I like the colors.
How'd you like to kill someone for me?
When you find the guy, you'll know.
What kind?
You should have let me do the talking.
As it happens.  I didn't make that part up.
Where do <u>you</u> think he is, Mike.
Fuck you.
Huh?
Oh really?  Where you from?
You came to the right place, sir.  My wife's second cousin is English.  Well, Scotch-Irish.  Can I interest you in a holster?
This bloke she was bunked up with.  This Terry what'sit.
I go to work, try to keep my life together, put all that shit behind me, man.  What d'you want from me.
She didn't know what to say.  I thought someone should say something. To someone.  With me it was, I don't know -- Jenny liked me for some reason.  I felt like I owed her.
Five years, I think.  Long time.
Jenny told me she met him at the beach. Got blinded by his smile.  You believe that shit?  Son of a bitch never smiled at me.  Buried her at a "private" service.  Private for who. Him?
What?
That was one of them?
Do you have any friends, man?
Last time I saw you, weren't you up for some equity-waiver thing?
I was gonna be in that Michael Mann movie, you know -- with Pacino and DeNiro.  Got three callbacks.
Hey, Elaine.  You even know what he's saying half the time?
I thought maybe you just came for the ride.
Had a feeling it was you.
Why did you come here?
In any case, I don't suppose the salary you make sewing mailbags is really commensurate with international airline travel.
And not with all that buried loot you had waiting for you when you got out.  From the Wembley Staduim job, wasn't it?  Pink Floyd concert receipts.  Jenny would've been ... fourteen at the time?
Here, are you always this sarky?
Said it went on for donkey's years.
You haven't been lurking outside my building all day.
I might've been away for the weekend.
And you've seen Eddie Rama.
Do you even know who Terry Valentine is?
Who's Mr. Lindgren?
You don't believe it was a car accident.
On what.  What makes you so certain.
Jenny was supposed to come to my place that night.  She called me, asked if she could come over.  She and Terry had been -- having some trouble.  Lately.  I don't know about what.  On this occasion, it reached some sort of crisis point.
From pursuing your chosen profession.
Who remembers.
Overnight.  What about just now?
Only in the movies.
Dropped dead in the stalls in the Odeon, Muswell Hill.  Watching Doris Day.
Well, she twigged by the time she was eight or nine that daddy wasn't in the Royal Marines or doing scientific research in the jungles of Borneo or playing Iago in a worldwide tour of OTHELLO.
There's one thing I don't understand.  The thing I don't understand ... is every motherfucking thing you're saying.
Yeah, I guess you are.
But if you're mad at him too and he's mad at you ... that must make us pals.
Your client have a deal in Long Beach? How about downtown?  There's some folks there -- oh, wait, they're all dead.  Any of this ring a bell?
Don't you work with Ian?
Yeah.  I really admire the guy.  Well. Good to meet you.
Been away a lot.
Hey.
Makin' trouble for someone?
Looks like they just airbrushed the dick out of his mouth.
Two blacks and a Mexican in a car.  Who's driving?
Maybe she doesn't even know the English guy.
Straight rotation, no shit, call your shot.
You do?
What's in it?
How we gonna get that lucky?
You walked.  What the hell are you doing here.
So why would he want to see you.
Where is he, then?
Hello there.
Exercising my visitation rights.
What kind of trouble are you in?
Where's ... what's-his-name -- Fred --
It's been five minutes and I'm packing to leave again.  I can't believe this.
She could've had the deal!  I would've handed it to her if she wanted.  I would have given her everything.
...Yes?
Ann--
Ann, will you come in, sit down, maybe have a drink?
That's swell. However, the music, if you want to pursue it, well, the lessons from Mrs Swan, they'll only take you so far. There's this guy in San Francisco, I've made inquiries, everybody says he's the best. Trained lots of people who've gone on to have big concert careers, symphony orchestras, the works. His name is Jacques Carcanogues. I'm not sure I'm pronouncing it right. Anyway, he's a Frenchman.
...I'm not certain I'll have a career at all, and if I do, I'll probably be a veterinarian.
I do appreciate the interest you've taken, though.
I speak to you on ze phone, non? You have a special interest in music?
Is not so hard to understand. Her playing, very polite.
Mistake, no, it says E-flat, she plays E-flat. Ping-ping. Hit the right note, always. Very proper.
A goose, friend. I was chasing a wild goose. Ed, have you ever heard of venture capital?
It's called dry cleaning. You heard me right, brother, 'dry cleaning'-- wash without water, no suds, no tumble, no stress on the clothes. It's all done with chemicals, friend, and your garments end up crisp and fresh. And here's the capper: no shrinkage.
...You bring a check?
...Usually we do this kind of thing with a bank draft. But cash--that's fine--it's all the same in the end-- dough's dough, huh?
I got the paperwork here. Partnership papers here, they reflect our agreement: fifty-fifty on the net, I supply professional services, you supply the capital. I'll give you a receipt on the dough there, huh?
...Just a second here, I'll give you a receipt on the, uh... Whoa, Nellie... Oh, by the way, we didn't talk about this, I, uh, I think I'm gonna call the place Tolliver's, after me, you know, I didn't think you were much interested in, uh--
...Yeah, that's it. As per our discussion.
She's a rare one.
I guess it would be pretty awkward.
...You know... who *who* is?
I'd understand if you'd walked in here. Socked me in the nose. Whatever. I deserved it.
...What a knucklehead.
'Gratulations, Gina. It's so goddamn wonderful.
I know all about that. But I don't know how much to tell them.
Look, I don't wanna waste your time so I'll eat while we talk. Ya mind? *You* don't mind. So while I'm in town I'll be staying at the Hotel Metropole, the Turandot Suite. Yeah, it's goofy, the suites're named after operas; room's OK though, I poked around. I'm having 'em hold it for me on account of I'll be back and forth. In addition to my retainer, you're paying hotel, living expenses, secretarial, private eye if we need to make inquiries, headshrinker should we go that way. We'll talk about appeals if, as and when. For right now, has she confessed?
Good! That helps. Not that she didn't do it, that she didn't confess. Of course, there's ways to deal with a confession, but that's good!--one less thing to think about. Now. Interview. I'm seeing her tomorrow. You should be there. Three o'clock. One more thing: you keep your mouth shut. I get the lay of the land, I tell *you* what to say. No talking out of school. What's out of school? Everything's out of school. I do the talking; you keep your trap shut. I'm an attorney, you're a barber; you don't know anything. Understood?
...I don't get it.
...Did Big Dave mention that it was something about his war service? I don't know, I wasn't there, *you'll* have to tell *us*. Maybe he specified, maybe he didn't; I'm not putting words in your mouth; the point is that this liar, this cynical manipulator, this man who through his lies sneered and belittled the sacrifice and heroism of all our boys who *did* serve and bleed and puke and die on foreign shores, and who made a fool out of this entire town, turns to *you* to help him out of his jam. Fat-assed sonofabitch!
Bert's OK, sure, he's a good man. I won't kid you though, Ed, nobody around here has any experience with this kind of, er... And I hear they're bringing a prosecutor up from Sacramento. Capital offense. Taking it seriously... Hmm...
Taking it seriously.
Well, the best, the money-is-no-object best, for a criminal case, any lawyer would tell you Freddy Riedenschneider. Out of Sacramento. 'Course, I don't know how you're fixed for money.
Ed, how're you holding up?
I'm so damn sorry about your loss. Terrible thing. Just damn terrible.
...Huh?
...Did you make that up?
Russians exploded an A-bomb.
Jesus...
Frank.
I don't know... How it keeps on coming. It just keeps growing.
No, I mean it's growing, it's part of us. And we cut it off. And throw it away.
...I'm gonna take his hair and throw it out in the dirt.
...We goin'?
...Yeah, it's a tough break.
What'd he say? Does he understand?
Manual overrides aren't working.  I'm getting nothing, Lieutenant.
We all love the museum.  I come here myself with my kids.  We're trying to work with you.
I'll go down and speak to him.
Pendergast may be in trouble.  Don't you understand?  He still hasn't come back.  It's been over three hours --
Sweet Jesus!
I've read about the Museum's financial troubles.
For Chrissake, I'll do it.  What's the combination?!
The whole system is shutting down! We have to get out quickly before the fire doors fall!
I made it outside.  I'll co-ordinate the rescue efforts from here.  Help is on the way.  Just sit tight.
We need light in here, stat.
An original Roger Tory Peterson of a Red-Breasted Merganser.  Amazing.  I have a copy of this in my office at home.
How big is the sub-basement?
Did you hear that?  My God.  He says that Mbwun is real!
What's that doing here?
Dear God.  Where are we, Lieutenant?
Curious.  There's something missing.
Whatever it is, it must be common on the tepui.  John used it as packing material.
Like the claw.
Come on, Margo.  We're on the verge of something huge.  Let's consider the possibility, just the three of us, alone in this room.  What if John was right.  I mean, what if?  And he sent back an egg of his monster in the crates.  When it got to the museum, it hatched.
With the intelligence of a human being, the speed of a greyhound, and the strength of a grizzly bear.
What's going on?
Dr. Frock.  Did you hear that?
What's that?
None of that matters now.  The people upstairs need us.  We have to help.
I'm coming with you.
Dr. Frock?
This means there must be an animal loose in the museum!
It's from John.  Those two arrows were his insignia.  It's addressed to Louis Moriarty, a patron who financed his expeditions.
Dr. Frock, I was wondering.  What happened to the rest of Whittlesley's plants?
Quiet!
It had a long tongue, teeth this big and yellow eyes.
Shut them up!
Jesus, what is this?
What?
That's impossible.
What do you make of it, Margo?
Got to finish this thesis sometime.
Special Agent Pendergast.  FBI. Forgive me.  I guess I was snooping. What is this?
Yes.  He developed his own theory that he called the Calisto Effect. It held that evolution wasn't always gradual or driven by natural selection.  The environment would sometimes cause sudden and grotesque changes which could result in a "monster species".  It made no sense. But he felt he had evidence that Mbwun was such a monster, living in isolation on the tepui for thousands of years.
Where would we find it?
They're all heavily armed.
You're not.  Where is it?
I don't know how to deal with this. It's hellish.  Like nothing I ever saw.  I'm not trained to deal with a monster, a supernatural creature like that.
You'd slow us down and put Margo in danger.
Is there another way around?
Hide quickly!
What is it doing?
What happened?
For what?
We're not going to make the storage room!
Just like John.  He won't listen.
Where exactly?
Viti Levu.  For how many?
It's the busy season.
I thought you were in a hurry.
Why is he in the basement?
I'm sure we'll get him on this next sweep.
He doesn't care.
Welcome.
We've learnt about life as Truman has and, despite the complaints of a minority, it's been an overwhelmingly positive experience, for Truman and for the viewing public.
I have a map.
How can they have a child?
It's okay.  I probably wouldn't talk to me either.
No.
Right now?  We've got finals tomorrow.
I figured, what's the point?  I knew I'd just be taking my problems with me.  Once the kids came along, it made me look at Seahaven with new eyes.  I realized, what the hell could be better than this?  I'm telling you.  What you really need is someone to carry on the "Burbank" name.
You really think it could've dropped off an airliner?
I think I'm mixed up in something.
I think he's alive.  I'll tell you about it later.  I'm definitely being followed.
Oh, God.
What's the hurry?
--we need more charcoal.
Truman, I took the "hypocrite" oath!
Truman, what about that sign?
Why don't I make you some of this new Mococoa Drink?  All natural.  Cocoa beans from the upper slopes of Mount Nicaragua. No artificial sweeteners--
How are you, Mother?
You know surprises aren't good for me. You should really call before you come over, dear.
--Darling--
Now what?
See you tomorrow, Truman.
Do you live around here?
I think that about does it, Spooky.
What am I doing here?
They gave you a craniotomy to relieve the pressure from a subdural hematoma. But you've been unconscious since they brought you in.
Scully had a violent reaction to a bee sting --
You've been back to Dallas?
Are you going to let us in on what exactly you're trying to prove --
And you have conclusive evidence of this? Something to tie this claim of yours to the crime --
What is it you find incredible?
How can this be?
Do you want me to destroy this one, too? Before it gestates?
Who called this meeting?
Its effect on the host has changed. The virus no longer just invades the brain as a controlling organism. It's developed a way to modify the host body.
Do they know?
I'm looking for him.
Do I know you?
My name's Kurtzweil. Dr. Alvin Kurtzweil.
How'd you find me?
What is it? Kiddie porn again? Sexual battery of a patient? I've had my license taken away in three states.
I picked up the historical document of the venality and hypocrisy of the American government. The daily newspaper.
How can I reach you?
You've been using me --
I know that. But the threat was called in for the Federal Building across the street.
Jesus, Mulder...
I saw your face, Mulder. There was a moment of panic.
Something's not right...
Whatever you told them in there, you don't have to protect me.
They were the ones that put us together.
This isn't about you, Scully. They're doing this to me.
Mulder -- what are you doing?
Scully -- listen to me. I'm going home, then I'm booking a flight to Dallas. I'm getting you a ticket, too.
-- I'll have you back for it, Scully. Maybe with evidence that could blow that meeting away.
Ground's dry about an inch down. Somebody just laid this down. Very recently, I'd say.
And where are they going with it?
You think they went left?
That bomb in Dallas was allowed to go off, to hide something: bodies infected with a virus you detected yourself.
It may be extraterrestrial.
What do you think it is?
This is weird, Mulder.
Any thoughts on why anybody'd be growing corn in the middle of the desert?
What are you doing?
I can, Mulder. I debated whether or not to even tell you in person, because I knew --
Cold...
On whose orders?
Why don't you go on ahead head and I'll confirm authorization.
She's in there right now saying the same thing about you.
I know.  Agent Scully reported your suspicions to OPR. On the basis of her report, I sent techs over to S.A.C. Michaud's apartment. They picked up PSTN residues on his personal effects consistent with the construction of the vending machine device in Dallas.
Where's Scully?
I think of it as an agreement. A word your father liked to use.
You're lying.
Until Dallas, we believed the virus was simply a controlling organism. That mass infection would make us a slave race.
Why are you telling me this?
What happened to Kurtzweil?
Let me out. Stop the car.
You have precious little time. What I've given you the alien colonists have no idea exists. You hold in your hand the power to end the project.
You can't kill Mulder. He's got too much light on him.
Sing a song of sixpence...
Did we go sailing?
She adores you.
We've been over this a dozen times.  No.
Miriam...
It could take years for me to get past the barriers he's created.
I'd be there for him.
The first... What?  Six or seven times I went in.   Remember what happened?
Is it cold in here?
I still don't understand why I can't do this... This isn't some "troubled kid" you're dealing with.
This man is deeply disturbed, he...
I read about a woman in TExas who was in a coma for seven years.  Every time her husband came to visit, her heart would beat faster.  Isn't that something?  I don't know what name scientists have for something like that...
What about Julia?
Evil.
Where the hell are we?
COME ON!
He also says that until proven differently, Julia Hickson was found as a result of good old-fashioned detective work.
Thank you.
She the one from Santa Cruz?
Lattimer sold the hoist to a guy named Bainbridge who tired to build a machine works out near Delano.  Bainbridge ends up in bankruptcy court and the state winds up with the land - it's just sitting there.
Yep.  And guess who they hired to seal up the place?
Shouldn't we get a catheter in him?
Catherine!
When we got here, you just topped and pulled her out.
I have done this, you know.  Been inside.
What about narcotics?
Is she alright?
Here he is.
Why jeopardize what we've already done? We caught the sonofabitch.  Carl Stargher.  That's going to be like Bundy, Gacy, Dahmer.  A case that makes careers.  But if we push our luck.  If this is all bullshit and we come out smelling like it.
Right here.
Jesus Christ, man, you look like hell.
You were awfully good.
Don't understand what Harry saw in a fellow like that.
Yes. They said it wasn't the driver's fault. Harry often said what a careful driver he was.
What's she talking about?
Might as well I suppose. Are you busy?
Can I hear you?
What's the hurry? Can't we talk quietly for a couple of minutes?
Holly.
That's Harry's place, isn't it?
Let's not get into any more trouble.
What is on your mind? Why did you hide?
...anyway?
Must you take those letters? CALLOWAY Yes, I'm afraid so.
You know as much as I do, Miss Schmidt - you were intimate with Lime, weren't you?
Do you know this man?
You can help us.
Must you take those?
Yes.
My name is Calloway.
You a friend of Lime's?
Back in school. Never so lonesome in my life till he showed up.
"Death at the Double X Ranch" - Ra- a-nch.
Listen, Callaghan.
...expense.
So would I.
...a week ago.
...in the morning.
This is where he vanished.
Look...I tell you, you don't think I'm blind, do you?
Win what?
What time is it?
Calloway, can't you do something about Anna?
Very good, sir.
Welcome?
How long can one stay here on this stage money?
It was just a soldier. I was trying to punch his major in the eye.
Zane Grey.
Very popular, sir.
...leaving tomorrow, sir.
What do you want me to do?
You told them, didn't you?
It's wonderful how you keep the tension.
You really liked it?
...were of you.
...you.
...the best way one can, you know.
Mr. Popescu is here tonight.
Speak English?
Already gone.
Could he have been conscious?
I was told that he did not die at once.
The Roumanian?
Harry...
Wasn't he at the police inquiry?
He probably knows a lot more than that. Somebody's lying.
...Mr. Martins?
Where are you staying?
Lime.  Harry Lime.
Bonjour.
Oh, that noise! Yes, he certainly did.
He will not take us to the island. It's in the National Park and it is forbidden to go there. But we are allowed to travel to this one to stay for one night.
Yes, of course I can swim. How far do you think it is?
Oh. Great. Not far at all. I don't like to be negative, but do you think we should let someone know where we're going?
I don't know - I'm American.
We think in miles, not kilometers.
Everyone ok?
He said if we lent him money h would tell us about a secret beach.
Bonsoir.
Have you told someone?
We lost our key.
So there's an urban myth, well more of a rural myth, going around here at the moment. It's about a beach.
But, Danny, if HaShem is everything, and we are nothing how are we to judge His actions?
You think?! Based on what?
No one follows that midrash.
They're racist, they're militaristic, they act like bullyboys in the territories....
...So she takes the pants in back -- where they try them on? And I think fuck it....
Bring your friends.... We're not his friends.
Where did you read this? Robert Faurisson?
What do you care?
Which is what?
You're not in school? What do you do?
What's he care about?
Too many good players down here. I'm with one right now.
Your father??
But you can read it, the Hebrew.... Right?
Put something on. You're not supposed to be naked in front of it.
You're learning the Hebrew really fast.
What...? You think I'm Jewish?
You can't. Do you know how many people I've brought into...the movement...?
No. What are you looking for?
Who's Eichmann?
An investment banking house.
That would be a catastrophic mistake.
You wouldn't announce it?
But when it comes out, the public will be outraged. It will look like Germany all over again.
Is it okay if I record this?
Let me give you an example.... Sexuality.
And Jewish men like to get it.
You're not listening. He isn't better. He gives pleasure, but that's actually a weakness.
Notice the Israelis: a fundamentally secular society. They no longer need Judaism because they have soil. The real Jew is a wanderer, a nomad. He has no roots, no attachments. So he "universalizes" everything. He can't hammer a nail, plow a field. He can only buy and sell, invest capital, manipulate markets. He takes the life of a people rooted in soil and turns it into a cosmopolitan culture based on books, ideas, numbers. This is his strength....  Take the great Jewish minds: Marx, Freud, Einstein. What have they given us: communism, infantile sexuality and the atom bomb. In a mere three centuries since these guys emerged from the ghettos of Europe, they've taken us from a world built on order and reason and hurled us into a chaos of class warfare, irrational urges and relativity, a world where the very existence of matter and meaning is in doubt. Why? Because it is the deepest impulse of the Jewish soul to unravel the very fabric of life until nothing is left but thread, nothing but nothingness. Nothingness without end...
You believe that? And you call yourself a reporter?
Give me a reason not to.
But if the Jews are strengthened by hate, wouldn't this "destruction" you speak of -- by love or by any other means -- in fact make them more powerful than they are already?
It was a nine millimeter.
All right, what if all along you were actually infiltrating the Nazis -- to expose them....
Think about your father. Your sister.
I don't do that.
How have things been going?
Beth Shalom? What are you talking about? Who is this...?
You can have chicken with eggs but not with milk. Why is that?
Ah, Jesus Christ, Danny, how can you wear that thing?... You know what it means? To your people...
I'm doing a piece on right-wing groups, post Oklahoma City. I hear you're an important figure in those circles. You have a lot of interesting ideas....
Where's Mrs. Moebius?
That was unbelievable what you did to Lucas. The guy's an animal.
Get out of here....
What is it?
What about Drake, did he ever show up?
They don't. I checked twenty times.... Somebody must have talked.
Shoot him in the head. Always shoot a Jew in the head.
Who's this?
There's some maple walnut in the freezer.
So what?
We tested the new bomb.
Do you think I...
May He cause the light of His countenance to shine upon you and be gracious unto you....
Oh, fuck you...
What do you mean?
The papers are going to report tomorrow that your colleague, Curtis Zampf, has been a federal informant for the past two years. Do you believe that?
Maybe you should talk to him about it.
This is good work... unfortunately it's incomplete.  Could you eat a sandwich 40 floors above the street.
I wish, but it's full.  They recommended a pension in town. They say that all of Taormina is full.  What's going on here?
A spaghetti del mare for the super dedicated traveling insurance agent.
Little.  Very little.  And skinny, very skinny too.  That is compared to me.
Huh?  Well listen to him!  Do you hear that?
He looks me in the eye like some fuckin' gold fish, and says:  "I'm going to beat you".
Tonight we're having a little party among ourselves.  8 o'clock in my suite?
Is it a poem?
Okay, now we have a good five minutes to have a nice peaceful talk.
What else is there?
Is he alright?  What happened?
Enzo, wake up!
... What's your name again?
And where did you say you were from?
What's with the voice?
Is that alcohol?  Are you out of your mind?  Alcohol is strictly forbidden.
... So, after all these years, you must have lots of questions to ask.  Am I right?
Enzo?
Two years younger than you.
Good night.
You still collect them?
Don't you have a heater?
Please, have a seat.
You look adorable.
No.  I want to show you.  Is it ruined?
... No?
How can you tell it's a female?
She's not like the others.  She can't stand to be away from the sea.
Because one shouldn't fall in love with creatures from the sea.
Hello?
Well, then, talk to me some more.
Then, tell me a story.
Why did you take me to the hotel, if you live here.
Bonjour Monsieur... Louis. 
What are you doing?
Jacques...?
You want to lie down for a while?
You've got to tell me what happened?
Jacques?  I'm pregnant.
Uncle Louis, you remember Enzo's mother Signora Molinari from Amorgos?
What were Italians doing living in Greece anyway?
Yep.  How was your trip...?  Help me clean up, okay?
Well?
How was your trip?
It's his heartbeat.
I thought you said he was Peruvian?
You look it too.  You haven't been working out, you haven't been taking your vitamins!  You haven't been drinking your herbs, you haven't been...
If there was a problem, they could do something right?
Who... Who is that?
... The truck fell into a very deep crevasse.  We weren't able to save the equipment.
Alright Mordechai, now that we're alone I just want to say that I'm not happy about this. I don't want a repeat of that incident in the West Bank.
I guess I could be chalant about it, but then again I'm not even sure if that's a word. Listen Chief, we could stand around arguing all day, but I gotta case to crack.
You like my Mordechai, yes?
Client notes. Sorry.  What can I do for you?
What was that!?
I want you to talk dirty to me.
I want for our children to go to private schools and take music lessons. Little Abraham will go to Stanford for college, Batya will go Ivy League, maybe Vassar.
Your mother was right. You do work too hard.
Esther!
Hello Mazel Tov! A boojee boojee boojee boo...
Anything else?
But we're not open on Sundays.
Actually, I...I don't. What does that mean?
You watch your back Hammer. Hanukkah might just be his first move. For all we know Kwanzaa could be next. There's a lot of brothers counting on you. If you fail...
What's wrong with him?
Cool. What's it do?
Porno? You're tellin' me that you can get porno on that thing?
Where's my girlfriend Santa?
Well, he's kinda just resting in the corner with his girlfriend.
You want me to be nice to him for no apparent reason whatsoever, buy him clothing he'll never wear, and for just one day of the year pretend to forgive him for all the horrible things he did to me as a young boy when my mommy wasn't looking?
When you marry champagne, Clo-Clo, you can't trade it in for beer. You're stuck with it.
Is he in love with you?
No, sir. That girl in the cemetery? My cat didn't kill that girl. I told you cats don't go around looking for trouble. If that cat's alive, it's out in the country hiding under a bush, starving to death.
They don't say it to me.
Two hundred and fifty dollars you owe met
The death card - -
Well, I'd best be off.
It doesn't jibe with this  you told me the leopard would go out into the country - it wouldn't stay in the city 
Why?
You know Charlie How-Come?
It could be a man.
Jerry told me you were an expert with animals, Mr. Galbraith. Couldn't you tell where it went?
Well, I'm next. You won't hear anything like that, Mr. Galbraith.  I'm not a popular favorite since I let the leopard loose.
That's easy. Me.
You look swell in that threealarm number --
It must be the altitude  you, bucking around the countryside with a lot of bootandsaddle boys --
	As long as my feet held out.
Jerry, these flowers aren't really for me 
All those soldiers out there... getting bored, thirsty. Come out here for refreshment or female company perhaps?
Thats right.
De Moraes? I was asked here by a Mrs Spitz.
Is that why your brother braved coming here to ask you for a loan?
For your information, Mr Lombard, trouble is possibly the one thing Leon is capable of getting into all by himself. Though I doubt he will not ultimately fail even at that.
I found this at your brothers.
How dare you...  You dont know this tape belongs to my brother, do you, Mr Lombard?
Thank you for coming. Come in and close the door, will you?
Not yet. The place I hoped to find him turns out to be little more than a contact address. Ill give it 24 hours. He just might show up.  If you need to reach me ask for Mr Lamont. Paul Lamont, all right?
When did you get back?
Or is it the other way round? The children are needed because you cant satisfy him?
You do have a vivid imagination, Mr Lombard. I only wish youd use it fruitfully instead of in being obnoxious. I fail to understand your purpose in this. Still, say what youre owed if you still wish to be paid or get out, all right?
Whatever the reason, Im sorry I did. Goodbye, Mr Lombard. I believe you know your way out.
Huh! Dont you recall convincing me he had?  You should learn to live with your mistakes, Mr Lombard. There is some merit in it.
Does the name Pierre Dreyer mean anything to you? Hes a client of mine and a friend of your husband.
Adonis thought your brothers bodyd be found reasonably quickly when he hung it in Epping Forest, didnt he? Seemed like a good idea. An ex-junkie, obsessed with death; the perfect candidate for suicide. He just forgot one thing: forest ramblers are rare during your average blustery English November. An Englishman might have thought of that, but a Brazilian...
I doubt Friedman ever even met Leon, Deborah. Friedman dealt with select customers. As for my envelope, had he know where it was he wouldnt have mistaken me for a hitman called Lamont when we met in Los Angeles.
What was the idea? Husband is filled with fear when he learns his child suppliers being tailed?
Something like that?
You know something? Ive just seen so much ugliness I dont think Id mind four walls and dinner served every night at a regular time.  Id hoped to have a private word with Adonis, but if thats the way you want it.
Do you think wed let him get away with the murder of my brother?
The staff dont know yet...  I called my parents, told them everything...  I just couldnt take any more...
I... We have to bury Leon tommorrow...
Im sorry, sir. Could you try that again?
Youre sure you wont sit down, Miss Stewart?
Where were you staying before the attempt on your life and why cant you go back there?
Have you never heard of collect calls, Mr...
You know where to look for your Austrian, right?
What am I to do with the packages if...
Look, you dont tell me about some Godforsaken place where stuff so bad even I couldnt imagine it goes down and expect me to go quietly to sleep! What happened? Whos the guy? The Austrian?
What...?
Friedmans dead... They killed him...
Some Italian I picked up back there. Hes in the boot of the Mustang.
...Im Emily Stewart. The hysterical female who sees evil everywhere since the day her thirteen year-old boy disappeared. The pain in the ass who cries wolf at the drop of a hat. However I go about this thats who I am. Do you get what Im fucking saying, Mr Lombard?
Pups. Bitches. From three to twelve months.  Trained and untrained ones. White and brown ones. You understand?
On the bed!
Who are you?
Yes. Friedmans the fuckin Austrian!
Ever seen him before?
Whats this place? A hotel of some kind?
Where are the kids?
There were six on offer, you scumbag. Where are the other five?
Im sorry but Mr Gluck is not answering, sir.  Would you like to leave a message?
The Hyatt. Good afternoon. May I help you?
Have you heard of a French film called La Collectionoose?
Ive got work tonight, Jane.
Hello there. Hows the flat. I cleaned...
Carlos De Moraes?
May I...?
Lombard, this is not a Jewish name, is it?
Must I speak to you in French?
The 1,000 is on account.
We are aware of your rates, Mr Lombard. We will pay you double your rates plus expenses. In return, need I say it again, we expect discretion and undivided attention.
Maybe I dont.
What is?
What is it?
Five to three. Youre early.
An Austrian... Not much to go on, is it?
Im sorry...
In my jacket. Left inside pocket.
A private investigator... Youre not Austrian?
...Leons not here. How did you get here? Phil doesnt know where I live.
We didnt quite make it as lovers... Leon is a good man, though...
And you better stop greeting strangers with a shotgun. If Leons Austrian was looking for you I reckon hed have found you before I did.
Did he mention anything about having an exhibition of his work?
You sure? What about before he turned up with the boy?
Fine...
I hear youre looking for Leon.  That makes me, his old-lady, and now you, looking for the little bastard. Leons gone, man. Vanished. You interested in his photographs?
Oh. Thatd be Rhian, a Welsh chick he used to lay at weekends. She got wise and dumped him months ago...
Alors?
Gluck.
Nice way to help a colleague in trouble.
So you killed him and went to clean out his hotel room... How did Friedman say he got to know where to find me?
What you gonna do? Kill me?
Costliest!
What do you mean?
My dear Aulon, to you it shall befall the honor of impersonating the royal blood!
Why, are you not ready to die for your king?
I also need someone who can read and write.
He didn't tell you to cut all your hair off...!
I'll go.
Jeanne...!  Are you alright?
Jeanne... the king has ordered us not to ride with you anymore.
Well of course they're me!  That's how God talks to me.  If you listen hard enough, even you can hear him. Everyone can hear him.
The truth is always simple... it's you, Jean, who's making things complicated.
So... even you don't believe in me anymore...
I will ask my voices... if they come back one day.  Meanwhile... I'm going to Compiegne.
I am ready now...
I'm already free...
But that was her order!
Didn't you also carry a banner?
And?
Yes, but...
No, I... I held it up to...
Yes, maybe... I don't remember...
Be patient, my lord... you've seen how it is.  This girl has a way with people... but everyday we're making progress...
My king will pay any ransom you ask.
Quick -- hide in here...
Who are you?
But... the King -- my king -- didn't he pay my ransom?
I didn't mean it!  I didn't know what I was signing!  You tricked me...!
I ask only one thing... to hear me in confession...
It's true.  There's only one king... people need to be reminded of that. Nevertheless... Jeanne has done so much for us...
There's no need to be afraid, sire.
5,000 gold crowns.
It is all his majesty can afford. He has even donated his very own personal savings.  His majesty will greatly appreciate a gesture of good will in this delicate negotiation between our two families.
It's coming -- I rode on ahead.  I have to speak with the Captain of the English army... his name's Talbot...
You know, I feel a great sorrow for you, because you're laughing now, but by tomorrow night some of you will be dead and having to repeat your jokes in front of God.
Jeanne, what are you doing with that... you've got it back to front...
The Dauphin -- he's sending us food -- and supplies -- and an army -- led by Jeanne -- the maiden from Lorraine -- isn't it wonderful?!
But... don't you think we should at least... go and... welcome her?
So you think you did well to cut your hair and dress as a man?
Tell us, Jeanne... why did you jump from the tower at Beaurevoir?
So who gave the order to bring me to this side of the river??
What happened?  Who gave the order to attack?
Jeanne... the man hasn't been paid for six months -- that's his only reward.  Let him take a few teeth...
Jeanne, if you don't mind... I'll stay standing... this armor... it's a nightmare to get back up...
You don't believe me anymore?
What have you done to me?
Who are you to even think you can know the difference between good and evil?  Are you God?
I don't know... I thought...
What are you doing out here?
That's too easy.  One minute you want to die, the next you want to live...  Do you think that life is a toy that can be played with and then broken when you don't want it anymore?
No, no -- you can't stay or they won't come!
They won't come anyway.
Because... because I don't know what else to do to please him.
"Love your enemies"...
Are you going to leave me too?
You think you are ready now?
But you already confessed this morning...
They weren't my shoes.  Mine were too small.
Then... why are you here so often?
Him?
Hello.
Who are you?
When's your baby due?
Get your things together, you have to leave!
The Gestapo found our weapons. They've arrested Janina and Andrzej. They're bound to find out about this place, too - you must get away at once.
Have you seen this?
What's happened?
wish I knew you better.
Henryk's in there.
Believe me, they've picked him up.
And suppose they take the table away?
And, please, tonight, for once, I don't want anything bad talked about. Let's enjoy our meal.
They bombed us, we're off the air.
Mama, that was a great dinner.
No, no. Listen, I've been thinking --
We leave the money and the watch on the table. And we cover it like this.  In full view. The Germans will search high and low, I promise you, they'll never notice it.
I know.
It's not funny.
Did you beg, did you grovel to that piece of shit, that cockroach?
What's that mean, no employment certificate?
Why didn't you come to me?
I'm not, but Majorek is.
Puppydog, what d'you mean, you forgot?
Thank God - Wladek! You're wounded.
Out of Warsaw.
I'm sorry, I did my best, I thought the certificates would save us all.
You don't want to worry about that. My grandfather was jilted by his girl friend when he got jaundice.  In my opinion, jaundice is not very serious. Drink up.
What the hell are you doing?
What's happening?
I knew she was mute, but now I'm thinking it's more than that. I'm wondering if she's not brain affected.
How are the lessons going? ADA nods enthusiastically. He's getting on all right? ADA nods again Good.
One day when my mother and father were singing together in the forest, a great storm blew up out of nowhere. But so passionate was their singing that they did not notice, nor did they stop as the rain began to fall and when their voices rose for the final bars of the duet a great bolt of lightening came out of the sky and struck my father so that he lit up like a torch... And at the same moment my father was struck dead my mother was struck dumb! She- never-spoke-another-word.
Good, flatish land with reliable water, why? I don't have money. What are you about?
Well Baines the music lover, I never would have known. Hidden talents George.
And what does this do to our bargain? I cannot afford the piano if you mean me to pay.
Wash them again.
He says you're not to see her or he'll chop her up!
What did she say?
I think I'll keep that to myself. Which way are the rooms?
Best we had was Cat's Eye in the second at Del Mar, and he was only 5-2.  Not many longshots comin' in today.
Give it to me!  Please.  I gotta know it's all there!
I dunno.  That little mug that got ya is mad enough at me already -- what if he's out there waitin' around a corner with some friends.
Sorry, pal.  I'll fix you up, call you a doc, but I ain't gonna walk into a bunch of knives for ya.
How 'bout a handkerchief?
You're late.  Where you been?
What the hell you gonna do with yourself?
You been making your payoffs, haven't ya?
We cleared 22 here.
Wasn't no problem a mine.
We were partners.  If it weren't for Luther I'd still be hustlin' pinball down at Gianelli's.  I don't need anything more than I got.
There's always a depression on.
I thought you blew all your money.
Doyle, can I see you a minute?
They're still looking for him.
Name's Danny McCoy.  No Neck McCoy we called him.  Runs a few protection rackets for Carnello while he's waiting for something bigger to come along.  Me and Danny been friends since we were six. Take a good look at that face, Floyd, cause if he ever finds out we let one lousy grifter beat us, you'll have to kill him and every other hood in Chicago who'd like to do the same thing.  You understand what I'm sayin'?
Glad to meet ya, kid.  You're a real horse's ass.
Aw right, he runs the numbers outta the south side.
I'll take him anyway.
Right down to my socks, turkey.  If I'da been half as scared a that lop-ear, I wouldn't a fallen asleep on 'em.  Lonnegan might kill me, but at least he won't bore me to death.
How'd ya do?
You know, somebody tailin' ya.  A torpedo or somethin'.
Then he drove me home.  He tried to put himself away as legit, so I went right into the pitch.
You think he'll show?
You just won't learn, will ya. Hell, you come in here, I teach you stuff maybe five guys in this world know, stuff most grifters couldn't do even if they knew it, and all you wanna do is run down a bullet.  You're just like all them new jerks. Lotsa nerve and no brains.  And ten years from now when me and the others are through and you dumb guys are all dead there won't be one gee left who knows the Big Con was anything more than a way to make a livin'.
You beat him, kid.
The porters say he runs a braced card game in one of the cars.  $100 minimum, straight poker.  Last time he pulled in here ten grand heavier than he left New York.
I can't lay that off in time.  We lose a bet that big, it could break us.
Who are you?
Not intentionally maybe, but that don't make no difference to Lonnegan. He'll swat you like any fly.
She don't work here no more.  I'm fillin' in for a couple days... till I can get a train outa here.
I, ah...thought you might wanna come out for a while.  Maybe have a drink or somethin'.
Twist?  I told him the tale.  He wants to see ya.
Les, I got Mr. Lonnegan with me. He wants to see you a second.
You sure you wanna start off that big?  Bet like that could put a real dent in us.
What do you mean?
What's the matter?  You gotta get back to Shaw?
If you help me out, I'll pay ya back the money you owe Shaw, myself.
And you were gonna pay me back?
Well give yourself a couple seconds, crumb.  You wouldn't wanna lie to me.  Lt. Snyder here says you done a lotta griftin' in this town.
We were getting 50 from our guy.
Yeh, and what if we play tomorrow and he doesn't come up with the money.  We risk our whole operation for nothing.  I'll say when we make our bets.
You weren't hired to miss him.
We'll take it.  You manage the building at the end of the alley?
Well we do.  He's chummin' around with a Big C named Henry Gondorff. Ring any bells?
Don't crack wise to me, flatfoot. I spent a lotta time in dumps like this, eatin' Gondorff's dust while the bunco squad gets rich tippin' him off.  But it's not gonna happen this time.  We're not even gonna let the police know we're here.  If you keep your mouth shut and do a job, there'll be a promotion in it for ya.  And you better take it, cause I can make ya work for us without it.
He's gonna set up Gondorff for us.
Why not?
Then just say he was sixty years old.
What's the matter, darling ... not sweet enough?
Any luck?
She's got me worrying, too.
Darling, don't cry.  Please.  I know it's terrible.  But isn't it really better this way?
That isn't true.  It was about your father.  Where is he?
You took that money from Julia's hand.
Then what are you hiding?
Mother!
How did you ever remember me?
You heard about Julia Wolf?
Hello, Dorothy. 
It's been the same one for three months.
Mother's set her heart on a big church wedding.
He can stay home.  Please, Dad, won't you?
Goodbye, darling.  Don't you dare forget...  December 30th.
You can take that out to the car.
Yes.
How'd you people happen to pop in?
Yes.  I might not have been shot.
I never saw him before.
Wanted to tell me he didn't kill Julia Wolf.
What about the suicide?
Get anything?
Are you kidding?
I didn't know they had a fight.
Did you see anything in Miss Wolfe's hand?
You did!
What kind of clothes was he wearing?
Have a shot?
She drives me nuts.  She's been ragging me all day.
I'll get some.
Why, you said...
Who's that man?
The government bonds.  The ones you took from the office safe.
I'm not telling anyone.
I wish you'd count them.  There's a thousand dollars there.
Dorothy told me you were here.  I was going to telephone but....
I see.  I see.
How are you?
I've done that already. He should appear, you know.  It doesn't look well... his staying away at a time like this.
Clyde Wynant's crazy... absolutely crazy to stay away at a time like this. No wonder the police think he has something to do with it.
But he knows you.  All you have to do is get in touch with him, and tell him that Mimi says everything is all right... but that I've got to see him.
It isn't a story - it's true.  I did see Wynant.  He's not dead.
I've never heard about you.
That's all swell.  Only you're peddling your fish in the wrong market. I've got nothing to do with it.
Pretty girl.
What hit me?
I can't lie here.  I've got to get up and trim that darned Christmas tree.
What are you going to give me?  I hope I don't like it.
You're a fine watch dog.
Finished with these?
Philadelphia.  Then he didn't do it, did he, Nick?
Sit down!
So am I.
What's that?  What are you up to?  Nickie - what is this?
I know but this is different. He's a crazy man. He might kill you.
You bet I wouldn't.
Don't say it that way. Say it as if you meant it.
Nick, you'd better lay off that liquor.
What makes you so sure it's Wynant's body?
You don't get another swallow 'til you really open up.
But the poor kid's going crazy. She'd rather know her father was dead than that...
I've got a lulu -- why?
You give such charming parties, Mr. Charles.
Serve the nuts - I mean, serve the guests the nuts.
You're going to drive me crazy!
If that knife is missing, I'll look for it in your back.
Is that true?
You can save that and tell it to the police.  They'll be here in a minute.
Nick Charles here?
Bonds, sir?
Where are you going?
Home?
You speak English?  DO YOU SPEAK ENGLISH!?
Think we're going to do it?  Think we're going to war?
...And it's very important when you sit down never to point the soles of your shoes at anyone.  It's considered offensive.
What's it say?
It's a map, I think that's what it is.
You're out of your minds, you know that? Both of you.  You don't even know if there's anything out there.  What the hell are you thinking?
What are we going to do!?
This is miles from the battle lines. They were probably deserters.
Maybe we are crazy for doing this.  But if we do it, we do it right.  I just needed to explain that in a way I wouldn't have to do it again.
Not much of a pass.
Should be easy going from here.  Stay on the pass straight to the dot.
Otherwise whatever we're looking for could be anywhere.
I don't think the line will take the weight of a man and the coins.  Wes!?  We'll send the gold up, then me and Jaeger'll climb back.
You're the one with all the ideas.
Get off him.
What happened?
I don't care what he says, he wanted our gold.  Would have slit our throats if he had the chance.
We can't just leave him.  He'll run back to his outfit, report our position...
That's what he says.  He could be a spy, or something.
I'm not going to let you kill him.
I'm not going to leave him be just so he can stab us in the backs the minute we turn around.  I have been through too much to lose it all now just because the two of you don't have the stomach to do what has to be done.
You've got an awful lot of orders in you. Always giving orders.
No navicom.  A lot of good you are now, Epps.
Then I suppose it'd be insurrection, and I suppose I'd have to kill you.  I suppose.
At-at-at-at-at.  At-at-at-at-at.
I told you, I'm shooting Iraqis.
Oh, man, you're not going to fall for that.
You all want to lay off?  God.  I hope the Iraqis shoot me; put me out of my misery.
Wellllll, if you read it it must be true. Was it in the Star, or the Enquirer?
It's war.  People get lost all the time in war, cut off--
You're getting gold, and you're going to blow it on wheels?
It's not about being fun.  It's about being smart.  You take that money, you take care of it, let it grow, and you don't ever have to do anything again. Ever.  That's freedom.  That's what I'm talking about.
Steady it out!
And you missed this?  How are you going to miss something like this?
Where you going?
You're moving away because it's going to blow up, isn't it!?  It's going to blow up!
You're not losing trust, are you?
Maybe we should blast it loose with the claymore.
I don't see how that plan's any better.
What the hell took so long.
We should head Northeast.
There's another pass on the photo.  We can avoid that narrow one we had to cross on the way up, and it should get us back down.
No.
First Wes, now you?
I'm glad I didn't have to kill you.  I'm glad it didn't come to that.
Really, I'm not.  Remember how I was talking I wanted to blow away all those Iraqis?  That's all it was was talk.  I was scared out of my mind to go to war. I still haven't gotten over stepping on that land mine.
Wonder how the war's going?
An Iraqi?
Is that good, or bad?
Yeah, but why me?  What if the car doesn't stop?
Yeah.  Even after that.  You didn't take it out on me, except for maybe making me lie in the middle of the road now.  But I'd say you've been very fair.  I just think it's a hell of a man who can keep from going money simple.
I'm thinking about taking a trip.
I've never been anywhere.  I wouldn't know where to go.  Where would you go?
Australia.
I'm looking for a favor.  I need a map of Iraqi.
That shouldn't be too hard to read.  Iraq is the pink thing.
Planning on going to war all by your lonesome?
Ready for what?  Sight-seeing?
Yes.  Yes.  That's exactly it.  Yes.
We ought to kick their asses anyway. Even if they do get out of Kuwait we ought to kick their asses.
You know the fifteenth is the deadline for the Iraqis to get out of Kuwait.
You ever think about dying?
At-at-at-at-at.
We...we could go home with something else.
You don't know where the Iraqis have moved to.  And our forces haven't even engaged the Republican Guard yet, we don't know--
If there's gold.  If!
We have to go back.
So, you just let us drive on knowing we were losing fuel?  Knowing we were going to run low in the middle of nowhere?
You two don't even know how crazy you are.  You want to go on your sick, little treasure hunt then go ahead, but mark me absent.
Jesus!  What the hell did he do that for? They're Iraqis.  Why are Iraqis killing Iraqis?
So?
Maybe they're as scared of us as we are of them.
You down?
You're going to burn up in those.
I can't hear him.
What did you get?
I don't know.
I have to... he's a G-34
That's not dirt...Can't be dirt.. Dirt is a violation.
You slipped on a T297 transfer just before lunch, didn't you?
I couldn't turn you in, not now. I....I know I wouldn't!
Are you all right?
They're watching us now.
THX!
Good Lord!
He's coming back for the rest of us.  He can't make it alone.
Wait!  I'll talk to him.
How far did you go?  Was it cold?
I'm sure it's warmer in her than outside, though.  I haven't been out yet, but it usually is...the control is fouled... 
What are you doing here?  You're not cleared for this area!
I'm leaving.
What?
Which way?
Lost SEN!  He'll never find us.
...it doesn't matter.  The rest of it just didn't happen.
Oh, That!  I'm 5555 SRT Entron..
She's not there
Just do it.
High-grade det cord. This girl, either she's got strange taste in jewelry or she's into serious demolition.
Sorry about that.  That's an inch of the stuff, imagine what the whole thing'd do.
What was-? Why...?
Now wait just a fucking-
By the way, I'm Glass. This is T.J., and Pooch.
Treat. We treat devices.
The place has already be combed. Forensics pulled over a hundred sets of prints inside.
So what were they doing here?
Right.
How long were you hooked?
Ex-girlfriend?
Driving in circles, waiting for-
How do you know?
More metal... sharp edge...
Yeah, another round thing.
What... ?
What do you think?
C4, plastic explosive.
Relax, Pooch, it's just a ticker, it's not personal.
Jesus...
What's the matter?
Why are we stopping here?
What about the ballistics report?
That guy's wife must be pretty pissed off to play a trick like that.
Vice... Jesus.
Next week we work the park.
So what'll you do? After they give you the gold watch.
You outta the city... that's a fish out of water. What's with all this family talk lately, anyway?
Mike...
A what?
Got it! Ace Match Company, Flint, Michigan.
So what're we looking for?
Sir...
Yes, sir.
Glass, you're to stand by with your team.
Yes.
And then what happened, M'sieu Filiba?
<u>Tonsili!</u>
Yes, M'sieu Filiba?
No.
Yes!
Nice day, Major.
No doubt about it--it's that secretary.
Like it?
Insignificant ... He's a secretary, always <u>was</u> a secretary, always <u>will</u> be.
And as for you, waiter--
You're not safe anywhere nowadays.
And I don't see any reason for any man getting nervous when somebody checks over the figures of his report.
I am only insinuating that you are nervous.
You say I am a crook.
You'd better not. He's really very dull. But anyhow, when the king tells the marquis he saw me, the marquis will tell the marchesa. And the marchesa is the best friend of the Duchess of Chambro. And <u>she</u> will phone the Princess de Costa. The princess doesn't like me--but I don't care!
That's hotel life. In one room a man loses his wallet  and in another room a man loses-- his head. 
Please.
Darling, then let's be honest and return it to the lady.
Two fifty-three, five--
And we'll celebrate the second anniversary of the day we didn't get married!
Filiba ...
Correct. Now the train leaves--
By the way, how is your German?
<u>Auf</u> <u>wiedersehn</u>.
Goodbye--Madame Colet and Company! 
Then you go into the foyer.
Naturally I did.
Yes.
Make it out to cash!
But, madame, you keep a hundred thousand francs--in your safe--at <u>home</u>?
Crimson!
Precisely.
But incidentally, let me tell you, <u>I</u> don't like <u>you</u>. I don't like you at all!  I wouldn't hesitate one instant to ruin <u>your</u> reputation--like that! 
Yes, I would!
Like that!
Ah, let me have a little fun.
You look beautiful.
It could have been marvelous ...
Oh, M'sieu Laval ...
But my dear M'sieu Giron, I'm having a tea party. Must I be bothered with all these papers now?
Now. Uh--mademoiselle--in the short time you have been M'sieu Laval's secretary, have you noticed any change in him?
Right!
Well, in times like these most people are cutting salaries, but suppose we say, in your case, three hundred and fifty?
I beg your pardon!
Didn't you take it with you?
No--I'm sorry.
Yes, I saw it--but--
Five compartments. She can stay afloat with the first four compartments breached. But not five. Not five. As she goes down by the head the water will spill over the tops of the bulkheads... at E Deck... from one to the next... back and back. There's no stopping it.
Mr. Andrews, I did the sum in my head, and with the number of lifeboats times the capacity you mentioned... forgive me, but it seems that there are not enough for everyone aboard.
No! I'll do this with or without your help, sir. But without will take longer.
Bottom, left, right. I have it.
She says she's Rose DeWitt Bukater, right? Rose DeWitt Bukater died on the Titanic. At the age of 17. If she'd've lived, she'd be over a hundred now.
There's a satellite call for you.
None of the stewards have seen her.
She's not on the starboard side either.
We're too late.
What could possible be funny?
You know I don't like that, Rose.
It's just the God damned English doing everything by the book.
Yes. Your exertions below decks were no doubt exausting.
'Cause you're goin' to America!! Full house boys!
Goin' home... to the land o' the free and the home of the real hot- dogs! On the TITANIC!! We're ridin' in high style now! We're practically goddamned royalty, ragazzo mio!!
You can smell ice, you know, when it's near.
Keep pulling... away from the ship. Pull.
I don't understand a one of you. What's the matter with you? It's your men back there! We got plenty a' room for more.
Why have we stopped?
Here I am. I... I want to thank you for what you did. Not just for... for pulling me back. But for your discretion.
Oh God, I am such an utter fool.
So you feel like you're stuck on a train you can't get off 'cause you're marryin' this fella.
It is that simple.
Oh no! Oh, I'm so sorry. Truly!
You know, my dream has always been to just chuck it all and become an artist... living in a garret, poor but free!
I think I would.  And teach me to spit too. Like a man. Why should only men be able to spit. It's unfair.
You're not one of them. There's been a mistake.
Uh huh. You got mailed to the wrong address.
You're making this very hard. I'll be fine. Really.
Fabrizio said you might be up --
Pretty tough for a valet, this fella.
Now it's worse.
That guy Lovejoy put it in my pocket.
You have to go for help.
It's getting quiet.
Yes sir.
I tracked it down through insurance records... and old claim that was settled under terms of absolute secrecy. Do you know who the claiment was, Rose?
Don't come any closer.
My God, Rose, what's gotten into --
Rose, get in the boat!
Anya!
Then why the sudden exit without even telling me?
When I found out you were going I just had an attack of nerves--a few tears--and Herbert was on his way downtown to get my passport ... so who cares ... I'm here with you ... and that's all that matters to me.
Here's to Europe!  Couldn't try to look a little less glum, could you?
Hope we're not intruding.
So that's your little dancer that you were playing around with in New York.  Oh--there's no accounting for tastes--  Mine, too, seem to be in the gutter.
And when you do I'll convey your respects by wireless to Herbert.  Take it easy, Lee--no other woman'll ever get you. At least I'm honest when I tell you there must be something pretty low down in me--because I like you.  You're such a swine!
Thanks. I'll be there. About seven-thirty?
I hope so.
Isn't she lovely?
You're Anya Rosson, aren't you? I've heard of you back in New York.
Did you find it?
I should pass, but I'll trail along--I'll take three. 
Aces full.
You're coming back--
Aw--give a feller a break. My cards are on the table-- I want to know you. How about dining with me tonight?
Isn't she attractive?
Don't rub it in.
When?
See you at seven-thirty in the lounge.
Thanks.
That's funny--so was I.  Guess the ocean makes one sentimental
Will you take some advice?  If you're looking for romance--count me out--  --if you know what's good for you.
This time I'm really glad you showed up.
What?--
If I was smart I wouldn't be working my way over on this ship. 
We coulda got two third-class!
Nix, the law!
You're a wise guy--Gimme back--
Yeah--but high livin's made me soft.
A dollar forty.
Until then--the dollar forty stays with me.
Maybe she's in the show--One of the troupers--did you ever think of that?
Just a minute, steward--haven't you forgotten something?
Right!--but it doesn't have to apply to you--Keep your eyes open for anybody wearing a lot of cracked ice and give me the office.
Your mother is feeling seasick and would like to see you right away.
You keep it-- 
Why--I--er thought with all this heat turned on I'd hide it.
On the drunk.
Well, to tell you the truth, gentlemen, I've sworn off playing poker.
Care to join us?
This is exciting--but if it's been stolen they can't get away with it on a ship--
If he lets you down I'll try my hand at sleuthing--  Bet I could find that bracelet--
You know what I'd do, if I were you--before the card game I'd go to the Purser's office.
I'll go with you.
It's easy to see the Purser hasn't had much practice.
Here's your fifty.
That's too bad.
That's all right. I'll attend to this.
I won't--I'll ask for one right now.  Sally tells me she's in love with you.
Where do you live?
That's me!
Not yet.  Say, where is this boat headed for?
Come on, get up.  That horse is carrying too much of a load.
Hello, Inspector--I hear your vacation's been spoiled. Somebody lost a bracelet.
Very good, Mary--
Maurice Chevalier! There's a fellow with personality.
Get that out of your trunk.
Oh, Chad--what about the rest of the show?
He works the boats as a "come-on" man. We ought to make a fair combination and do a little business. Jack's a pretty good dealer himself.
Can you read 'em Jack?
The man that marks them is an artist--two hundred and fifty bucks for six decks--and they're worth it.
How much did you lose?
--you'd go with him!
I'm crazy about the kid and I got him into it.  What do you want me to do?
--and you swear when you get to the other side, you'll never come near either of us again?
I know he is. You change those clothes and then come to my cabin. I'll expect you around twelve o'clock.
I mean if you knew it were stolen.
Next time I get a vacation I'll spend it at headquarters. Good-night.
I mean--a lot of gentlemen would be offended if you searched them like that.
Isn't it great to be away from it all? Aren't you happy? It seems too good to be true.
I was in his cabin--
Ain't got time.
God damn son of a...
Just pick up your money and go. Sick of listening to you simper.
Listen, I want to talk to you.
Where'd you get that horse?
I want them spitting blood!
There's no God, there's no devil, I hate the God damn world!  I want To die!
Fair enough.  You know I got to Admit, you got a lot of bark on You comin' up here like this.
Forget it.
Not me.  I'm in my prime.
Here, Doc.
I calculate that's the end of This town.  And let's don't bother About the luggage, darling.
How you feeling, Doc?
Wyatt!  Just in time.  Pull up a chair.
It appears he missed an excellent Chance to keep his mouth shut.
What makes a man like Ringo, Doc? What makes him do the things he does?
Well hell, Wyatt.  Wyatt, I want You to meet Father Feeney.  Father Feeney's just been initiating me Into the mysteries of the great And ancient Church of Rome.  You See, it appears my hypocrisy Knows no bounds.
Rather an obvious question under The circumstances, don't you Agree?  A better one might be how Do you feel?
I played the cards I was dealt, Wyatt.  Your problem is you're Always trying to play someone Else's.  Allow me to tell you the Truth and thus set you free: There is no happiness, Wyatt There is no normal life.  There's Only life, that's all.  Just life. The rest is relative.
You know, Stephen Foster.  "Oh, Susanna".  "Camptown Races", Stephen-stinkin'-Foster!
Drunks.  Crawfished a bet, called Him a liar.  I saw the whole thing.
You really look awful.
See how she breezed out of here. Like she had wings.  Funny thing But I can't really remember how She looked.  I can remember parts Of her clear as crystal, her Mouth, her walk, how she shut her Eyes when she laughed, little Bits and pieces, but not the Whole package.  Can't put it Together for some reason.
Wyatt, I... I ain't got the words.
All right, what's it to be?  New Mexico's that way.
There they go.  Look kinda like preachers.
You know, we might just pull this off.
Yeah, better run, you bastards!
Praise Jesus!
We're the law, ain't we?  Well the Law don't ride around vermin-
We've never actually met.  My Name's-
Oh...  Now she's starting.  How do they know?
Fun though, wasn't it?
Of course, I'm always happy. Unless I'm bored.  That blonde Woman, is that your wife?
Just doesn't, that's all.
Oh look, I haven't got time to be Proper, I want to live.  I'm a woman, I like men.  If that's Unladylike then I guess I'm not a Lady.  At least I'm honest.
What's wrong?
Always?
No, no, get away, get away from me...
Those Cowboys're tellin' Everybody in town they're gonna Clean you out.  They're down in That lot right now behind the OK Corral.
Wyatt, I couldn't find a single Store that had laudanum any-
Long as I live I'll never Get used to that sound.
Well, I was thinking, we've Already made a pile of money. Maybe we should just pull up Stakes and move on.  And we could Stay on the move, you know?  Just Keep going, see the world.  Live On room service the rest of our Lives.  How'd that be?
You're a Cowboy, you're a Brother.  Come back, no hard Feelings.
No, wait.  Please.  I know nothin' I say'll fix things but I want You to know it wasn't me.
I don't like it.
Boy, look at all those stars.  Bet You can see every star there is. Practical touch 'em.  Kinda makes You think, you know?  I mean you Look up and you think God made All that but he still remembered To make a little speck like me. Kinda flattering really.  Hey, Wyatt, you believe in God?  No, Come on, really, do you?
Wyatt, meet Fred White, he's town marshal.
Hey Doc!  Come on now.
Listen to me, both of you.  This Is no good.  This is trouble we Don't need.  For the first time in Our lives we got a chance to stop Wandering and finally be a Family.  Do this and you throw it All away.  You saw what happened To Fred White.
Dropped him, that was it.  Sorry If I made a worse mess for you.
That thunder's sure somethin'.
You were right, Wyatt.  They got Me good.  Don't let 'em get you Too.
Remember about the light you're Supposed to see when you're dyin'?
For a man that don't go heeled You run your mouth kinda reckless.
Go ahead.  Skin it.  Skin that Smoke wagon and see what happens.
Way ahead of you, Wyatt.  You want Us to help you get Ike Clanton And Johnny Behan.  Everybody knows They're the ones to blame for Your brothers.
Got a sheaf of federal warrants. Being in the Territories it's up To our discretion how they're Served.  That means we got the Cowboys without quarter.  The Black flag, brother.  No Prisoners, no mercy, amen.
Allie-girl...And Louisa!  You're So lovely.  I'm at your feet, Darlin'.  Just at your feet.  Guess it's only right.  Ma always Said you were the prettiest.
Well that's your problem.  Hey Virge, see anything of Doc while You were in Prescott?
Maybe I jumped the gun.  Maybe Those Cowboys aren't near as bad As they're painted.  You know I Was thinkin', there's a lot of Money in the cattle business...
Here they are again.  Look at 'em.
Wait till the liquor wears off. Once they start getting headaches They'll lose interest.
Virge, you're makin' the arrest. You make contact, I'll back you Up.  Morgan'll back me up, Doc'll Keep an eye out for trouble.  And Keep your hands on your guns. They even look like they're gonna Start something, buffalo 'em. Right over the head.
Virgil?
What about all these saloons?
See what I mean about it getting Spooky?
Why don't you just leave it alone?
I appreciate your assistance, M. But this is now a military operation.
A piece of advice, Mr. Bond: Don't screw with a man who buys ink by the ton.  It's deadlier than uranium.
How did you get this number?
Briefly.
I'm sure they will.
Are your guards really going to kill a helpless girl?
I'd rather die alone.
Next morning. Both boats. Nothing wrong.  My 90 year old grandfather thinks 'Ghost in the computer - Silicon Dragon.'
Maybe you should talk to Sidney Winch. Owns a marine salvage company. Nobody knows more about the Strait.
Do I have to dial '9' to get out?
Don't you think you're overreacting?
Oh, James. I've missed you -
Stop it! You're hurting me! Can't you just be nice?
What about the uranium?
Why didn't you tell me? Why wasn't it in our files?
There is one last thing, 007: Elliot Harmsway is vital to the economic interests of this nation. He's also a major contributor to the party. I expect him to be given every consideration.
It must do something.
Saunders, I've lit cigarettes -
Perfect way to tie up a... 'Knotty' problem?
Natalya?
Can you arrange a meeting?
Where to now, Jimbo?
Do I have to do everything around here?
If I were you -
You heard me. A gun?  I left mine in the car.
Harmsway sank that ship and stole the gold. It's on the Sea Dolphin II.  And thanks to your little show and tell -  - giving him the evidence -  We're the only ones who can tie him to the crime.
Blood or Dutch?
Sometimes you just have to -
Another reason??? Did I miss something???
Which is also why I've withheld this information from NATO and our allies.
But if Elliot Harmsway is involved with that uranium, I want him prosecuted to the ends of the earth.
I was just getting to the interesting part!
Sakwa!
And the 9:30 news meeting is waiting.
How is it now?
What is HE doing here?
Obviously, the British government denies all of this -
He brought that up from the wreck.
...Well! I do believe this requires further investigation!
That was too close.
Please, Sidney. I'd like to remember you fondly.
Take the men. I can finish alone.
- Built to withstand a nuclear blast.  Are they alive?
Mr. Stamper will escort you to the plane.
Who is that?!? What's in the box??
Will it go off?
I pay my own way.
What did your wife get her?
Well, you are his grandfather. He is supposed to spend some time with you. You're supposed to show him those woodsy things and this and that.
When are you going to find time to help me fix the roof?
Robert asks about you. When are you going to do something to help him?
That is a damn lie and you know it. Every time father asks you to do something, you either half-ass do it or run off and hide. Mama asked you to turn the dirt in her garden and you told her, with your smart ass self, that you weren't a farmer; get Junior to do it. Every time someone asks you to do something, you always say, tell Junior to do it. Boy, you ought to grow up.
Why don't you come in for a while?
You would think people never lived in a house if they have to ask what does 1 1/2 baths mean.
Linda, how come you don't see that Sunny puts his shoes on right?
I have more sense than to give up everything, my family, you and Sunny. It wasn't me, I mean the real me inside my body. I'm glad it's over. It's like a veil has been lifted.
It was like all those things old country people try to tell you what hell is like.
Doesn't he look a whole of lot better?
I need to get my suitcase out of the garage.
Don't pick up the cards if you are not in the game. Did he die?
Your feet are cold.
I'm not going to let him get away with murder.
You're always taking his side.
You know, Babe Brother's wife just dumps greens in the pot without washing them.
Well, it's up to Suzie.
I have to feed the chickens before they wake everybody up.
I'm almost finished. I'm about to come to the punch line.
I came all the way from Detroit by bus going to Oakland. The bus stopped in Los Angeles. I had to get off and take a rest. I'll catch the last bus leaving at midnight. I'm just too tired to go on.
How often is your wife called to help delivery?
Good evening. It must be all the different time zones I crossed that makes me feel this weary.
What's the problem here?
I don't make no bones about where I'm going to spend eternity. I have always been wild and you know that. If you are made to feel half a man, what do you think the other half is?
Those boys never did have good luck.
How many people do you all feed?
Good God Almighty, bless your bones.  But the problem grows.
Some people grow up and change their ways.
An empty wagon makes a lot of noise and you, tappy head, you ain't worth the salt you put in greens.
Is this your house?
Did you have your child at home?
Some folks take that natural stuff too far.
I can't accuse him just dry long 80.
When did you talk to Harry?
What are you doing?
Wow!  Cool!
Yeah!
Well, honey, just grab some other toy!  Now c'mon!
Right here in the van.
Aach! -- Oh, hi, Bo.
You'd think they've never seen a new toy before.
Whoooooah!  Oh!  Bo!  There's gotta be a less painful way to get my attention.
Say, isn't that mistletoe?
Hello-o-o...
Yes, it is a mistake, because, you see, the bed, here, is my spot.
They are a terillium-carbonic alloy and I CAN fly.
Why, thank you.  Thank you all. Thank you.
Oh, no, no, no...  Buzz, look!  An alien!
Why is that soldier strapped to an explosive device?
Oh.  Oh, that's good.
Sheriff, this is no time to panic.
Get away!  Hoo-cha!  Hoo-cha!
Woody, stop it!!
I think you've had enough tea for today.  Let's get you out of here, Buzz.
Oh, come on, Buzz.  I...Buzz, I can't do this without you.  I need your help.
No, no!  Turn 'em around, turn 'em around!
Oh, impressive wingspan.  Very good!
Are you peeking?
Son of a building block, it's Woody!
Oh, that is disgusting.
Where's my ear?  Who's seen my ear? Did you see my ear?
Good going, Slink!  Now, just, just tie it on to something!
No!  No!  Don't leave!  Don't leave! You've gotta help us, please!  You don't know what it's like over here!
If I send out the troops, will you all calm down?
What the heck is up there?
It's Sid!
We believe you, Woody.  Right, Rex?
Mission accomplished.  Well done, men.  Pack it up, we're going home.
Oh, no...it's a Combat Carl.
Reach for the sky!!
This town ain't big enough for the two of us!
Somebody's poisoned the water hole...
Woody!  Speed up!
You'll put your clothes here.
I like plaits.
He can't abide a woman in trousers. He says a woman in trousers is a sin against nature.
Is there anything else I should know about him?
I won't do it because he wants me to do it, even if I want to do it.
Can I come into bed with you for a little while, I feel terrible.
Would you mind holding me in your arms for a little while?
You <i>are</i> cold. Where have you been?
'Have ploughed the stormy seas - '
They're going to fly everywhere. Mean things. They should have taken us.
I'm not too young. Juliet was my age.
Did you do this?
Anna.  What's wrong?  What do you want?
He's not here.
Why does he need money?
How much?
Good.  From now on I want you to expect that every word you utter will be tape-recorded, that the movement of your lips is being read. Got it?
That was a stupid thing you did. Incredibly stupid.
It's Saturday, Arnie.  You work too hard.
Like a Grateful Dead Concert.
So you know we put the case before the arbitration panel, none of whom had any expertise.  Superfund is just one of those words.  People stop paying attention.
Because I'm at the edge of my capabilities, Robert.
If you start in on the war metaphors I'm going to drive this car into a fucking telephone pole.
Did you tell Dad?
Hi.
What's up?
Helena --
What's it like?  Imagine you're being accosted by a swarm of beggars in the heart of Calcutta, except the beggars are wearing $1500 suits and they don't say "please" or "thank you."
What is wrong with you?  What?  You're going away.  You're getting help somewhere.
Private?
No telltales.  Nothing to read. Not touching my face.  Not even blinking.  No giveaways.  How're you feeling?
No more pissant basin league bullshit for us, hunh?
Move 'em to Texas, fry 'em up.
I have dreams about this, actual dreams about busting the top people, the rich people, the white people.
What do we do?
Remember when we sat on that mob guy, that chef, for like six months?
What do you think it is?
What would a law firm want from the new drug Czar?
Women's room, stall two.  Should we stop for ice-cream?
You were followed by the police, but they won't hear us over the children. I want to use a bomb.
So, it's worth the wait, right? What can I do?  Rent a Huey?  Have an airlift?  It's not like you can put it in a condom up some mule's asshole, right?  How many peasants would that take?  A line stretching from here to Mexico City --
You expect me to be grateful for spending the rest of my life looking over my shoulder.
Why do you say that, Mr. Marquez?
I don't think you're going to do that.
You first.
Fine, then we don't have deal.
Please.  Filing a report will not help you find your car.
One question.  How did you find about this?
I'm curious how you did this with such economy.
The cocaine brand, 911, is an East Coast brand, a Juarez Cartel brand, and you must know it usually comes through into El Paso?
My work keeps me young.
The busiest land border crossing in the world.  Over forty-one thousand vehicles per day, twenty-two thousand pedestrians on foot.  I think we do a pretty good job but we know a lot of drugs are still getting through.
Sure.  More money in intelligence on their side of the border.  So we have a better idea who we're looking for.  More dogs.  More people. Supposed to be getting some giant x- ray machines to run the trucks through.  Outside of martial law that's about the best you're gonna do.  But, I should tell you, there are two things that really have us on edge right now.  In the last six months seizures have tripled, even though we're pulling over the same number of cars.  What does that tell you?
I'm looking for my daughter, Caroline. She comes here.
Oh, man --
I don't give a fuck about your parents --
I don't know, maybe we missed her.
I just want to be clear about one thing.  I used to work for him, but now I work for you.  I'm not a partisan person, I'm an issue person. In the next few weeks, if you allow me, we'll get you well-versed on an incredible array of issues.  The most important of which, in my opinion, being Mexico.  I know everybody that you're gonna meet. It's important that they like you. It's not important that they like me.  That's why I can help protect you.
He died in a liposuction surgery, right?
He's a research doctor.  You're dad's a doctor, too --
I'm sorry.
Well, why didn't you bring them?
Twenty thousand.
Hey, I'm wanting a bet put on.
Buy yourself that island in the sun?
What's your name?
Where are you going, Diane?
Where's that?
You're not getting any younger, Mark. The world is changing, music is changing, even drugs are changing. You can't stay in here all day dreaming about heroin and Ziggy Pop.
It's so simple. We buy it at four grand, we punt it at twenty to this guy that Sick Boy knows, and he punts it at sixty. Everyone's happy, everyone's in profit. I put up two. I come away with six.
Actually it's a nightmare. I've been desperate for a shag, but watching him suffer was just too much fun. You should try it with Tommy.
I'm an old boy myself, you know?
But try too hard --
It's a tightrope, Spud, a fucking tightrope.
I chose not to choose life: I chose something else. And the reasons? There are no reasons. Who need reasons when you've got heroin?
You Only Live Twice?
Screenwriter?
Who wrote it?
You don't know, do you?
Well, at one time, you've got it, and then you lose it, and it's gone for ever. All walks of life: George Best, for example, had it and lost it, or David Bowie, or Lou Reed -
Yeah.
Say something, Mark, say something --
I know a couple of addicts. Stupid wee lassies. I feed them what they need. A little bit of skag to keep them happy while the punters line up at a fiver a skull. It's easy money for me. Not exactly a fortune, but I'm thinking, 'I should be coining it here.'  Less whores, more skag. Swanney's right. Get clean, get into dealing, that's where the future lies. Set up some contacts, get a good load of skag, punt it, profit. What do you think?
So?
What was your price?
But you don't have the money?
From time to time, even I have uttered the magic words.
I'm going to get it right this time. Going to get it set up and get off it for good.
The Sick Boy method.
Sounds great, Swanney.
It's the great outdoors.
It's fresh air.
A walk.
We sought only your infinite wisdom.
It could. Yes.
He has his doubts...
Sulu, what are you doing?
Bob?
Your pain runs deep.
A starship? There are no starships on Nimbus III.
Captain, we can't trust anyone now.
"Row, row, row your boat..." I love "Row..."  Do - do you know "Row, Row, Row, Row, Row Your Boat?"
Captain?
Life is not a dream.
Spock, what is it? Do you know this Vulcan?
But he does seem familiar?
There was a young student, exceptionally gifted, possessing of great intelligence. It was assumed that one day he would take his place amongst the great scholars of Vulcan. But he was a revolutionary.
To land any closer would risk detection.
At footspeed I estimate the journey to Paradise City at 1.2 hours.
Exactly 15.5 seconds.
Exactly. That is correct. Sybok's mother was a Vulcan princess. Upon her death, Sybok and I were raised as brothers.
There Sha Ka Ree is fabled to exist.
Spock.
We must change our course at once.
I trust your message was received?
No... I didn't.
They can't be serious. The ship's in pieces and we've less than a skeleton aboard.
Easy, easy,  easy, Scotty. Easy. You're back with us.
Why not?
Sybok - this is not the God of Sha Ka Ree - or any other God!
Sybok.
You did break in.
My dinner.
Want one?
Flynn! I made it. I worked out some new codes for Tron, put 'em on a disk, and -- it's running.
Did you say Group 7 access?
I don't think I'm cleared for this.
They'll start to soon enough.
Come on in...
Well, I don't know...I just tried to run this program I've been working on, and I was denied access all of a sudden. I thought maybe I'd been laid off and nobody told me.
Yeah...?
Oh. Anything else?
where's your program? Won't it miss you?
This honey doesn't handle so good in town...
You said it.
I can't afford to have an independent program monitoring me. Do you have any idea how many outside systems I've gone into? How many programs I've appropriated?
The same thing I want with the Kremlin. I'm bored with corporations. With the information I can access, I can run things 900 to 1200 times better than any human.
That MCP, you know, that's half the problem right --
User requests are what computers are for.
Dumont!
Dumont! Where's Yori? Where's Flynn?
Alan!
What, just the three of us?
Well -- that's how it is for programs, yes, but --
Did we make it?
You're a..."guest" of the Master Control Program. They're going to make you play video games.
Hey, Ram ... what were you ... you know, before?
Yeah, yeah -- that's great.
Feel what? You okay?
Hey! Good to see you guys! Nothing classes up the place like a cleancut young couple.
Okay ... Flynn, I'm gonna put you at my terminal, down in the laser lab. We'll be up in Alan's office.
You've grown, big program.
Yes...it can take us across the Sea of Simulation... all the way out of the Game Grid...to the MCP.
You bitch.
You seem fine now.
Dana, are you listening to me?
You'd tell me if there was something wrong, wouldn't you, pumpkin?
I seem to remember something about a history project that's due tomorrow.
What a team.  See you at eight.
Kids.  Ten seconds of joy. Thirty years of misery.
See, kids now are ten years ahead				* of where we were at the same age. You probably think she's still a virgin--
Fourteen, Harry.
Okay.  Okay.  De-nail ain't just a river in Egypt.  She's probably stealing the money to pay for an abortion.
Twenty here, fifty there... I figured my wife's boyfriend was taking it.
Harry Tasker.  One zero zero two four.
You better watch it.  She might file on you for sexual harassment.
She's importing stuff from all over the mid-east.
Look at the way the little punk is driving.  He's all over the place.  Look-- he hasn't signalled once.
Same thing happened to me with wife two.  I had no idea until I came home and the house was empty.  I mean empty.  She even took the ice-cube trays from the fridge.  What kind of person would think of that?
Whatya talking?  I'm clean as a preacher's sheets, babe.  Clean as a --
She's lying.
Oh shit.  Harry... what're you doing?
... well get the Highway Patrol to go through the streets and tell everybody on their damn loudspeakers.  Just the basics... get away from windows, don't look at it... yeah--
I should have gone to the police, I suppose.
And you still reach for your piece every time.
So your clients want something for the lobby of their new corporate headquarters?
Especially in this light.  This is the only light they had then,				* so I like to study it this way. I love this place.  I love all ruins.
I'm sorry.  Thank you for the party.
Come on to bed, you don't have to brush your teeth.
...and I'm troubleshooting it with them over the phone... talking to a translator, right, who's getting half of it wrong... it was unbelievable...  really wild.
So, a little excitement in an otherwise dull day.  Did is work out okay?
How long have you been a member of his faction?
What did happen?
You weren't attracted to him at all?
Would you say he was boring, then?
This Simon.  Did you sleep with him?
Let me out of her!  Right now!
My husband can't know about this.
I think so.
I can do it!
Natasha?
Oh shit.
... you should have seen your father, standing there all covered with spaghetti sauce.  He looked like such a dope.
Not yet.  But we'll find him.
But with you, she gets to be hot, right?
Yeeaoowww!!
Beat it.
I said SIT DOWN.  Who do you work for?
Hello?
You'll call me then?
He said don't go nowhere. We'll be there some time tomorrow.
Did you get the letter?
Tell him we gotta go.
Tell him not to eat anything. We're gonna scarf when we get there.
Has he looked through it yet?
If that was the R, I'd love to see the X.
Well, enough about the King. How about you?
Tell me about yourself.
I don't remember.
Burt Reynolds.
I'm not sure yet. Ask me again later.
Oooooh, you look so cute in your little cowboy outfit. How old were you then?
You know when you sat behind me?
What are you, a theater checker? You check up on the box office girls. Make sure they're not rippin' the place off.
You have a pimp?
A real live pimp?
Is he nice?
Yes.
Where you goin', honey?
Is this a joke?
I felt so stupid just blowing those bubbles.
With a vengeance, I hated them.
But knowin' me and you gonna be nigger-rich gives me a whole new outlook. I love airports now. Me 'n' you can get on any one of those planes out there, and go anywhere we ant.
I thought it was what you wanted, Clarence.
It's been fun thinking about the money but I can walk away from it, honey.
Nigger, get real. You touch Jayne Kennedy she'll have you ass in Wayne County so fast -
Look, Elvis, he is hauntin' me. He doesn't deserve to live. And I do want to kill him. But I don't wanna go to jail for the rest of my life.
Clarence, I gotta hand it to ya. You were cooler than cool.
It's great to hear from you.
I'm a married man.
Money problems?
That's a pretty amazing story.
Well, for the past couple of years I've been goin' out with girls from my acting class.
... formica. I did real well. I think she liked me.
Is he big league?
In case of what?
Well, enough about the King, how 'bout you?
I grow it on my window-sill. The lights really great there and I'm up high enough so you can't see it from the street.
Coco leaves. You see, they take the leaves and mash it down until it's kind of a paste -
What?
No. No, you don't.
He says Wednesday at three o'clock at the Beverly Wilshire. He wants everybody there.  He'll talk to you. If after talkin' to you he's convinced you're OK, he'll do business. If not, he'll say fuck it and walk out the door. He also wants a sample bag.
Elliot.
Yeah, I subscribe. It's a pretty decent one.
But the bottom line is: I'm not Paramount. I have a select group of distributers I deal with. I buy their little movies. Accomplish what I wanna accomplish, end of story. Easy, business-like, very little risk.
OK, sorry, Lee. I just wanna tell you "Coming Home in a Body Bag" is one of my favorite movies. After "Apocalypse Now" I think it's the best Vietnam movie ever.
Where'd you go?
If you don't know shit, why does he think you can sell it?
I can, but I don't.
They have nothing. In fact, they think it's drug related.
Gangster. Drug Dealer. Somebody you don't want on your ass. Look, Clarence, the more I hear about this Drexl fucker, the more I think you did the right thing. That guy wasn't just some wild flake.
Keep it.
We do make a cute couple, don't we?
I've seen him.
What are you talkin' about?
Could I have one of those Chesterfields now?
It's about that pimp that was shot a couple of days ago, Drexl Spivey.
Yeah, and the restaurant's on my route. And you know, I stuck my nose in for the company to try to put a stop to some of these break-ins. Now, while I have no proof, the name Drexl Spivey kept comin' up Who's case is it?
I don't know him. Is he a nice guy? You think he'll help me out?
I don't know. He just appeared as magic.
That was a good fuckin' movie.
Do you believe him?
But a fuckin' baggie.
Or a bit player -
He's so spooked he'd turn over his momma, his daddy, his two-panny granny, and Anna and the King of Siam if he had anything on him.
You do more than try.
Looky here, you want the bitches to really fly high, make your rocks with Cherry Seven-Up.
You OK? That stupid dumb-ass didn't break your nose, did he?
You tell Jayne Kennedy to fuck it?
They won't search you. I promise. You haven't done anything.
He's at the Beverly Wilshire.
Excuse me, Mr. Coccotti.  Do you know Nick Cardella?
We want you to tell us about last night.
He's drugged out of his mind!  He's completely zoned out.
That the virus was taken from Philadelphia to San Francisco, then to New Orleans, Rio de Janeiro, Rome, Kinshasa, Karachi, Bangkok, then Peking.
Mr. Cole?  My name is Doctor Railly. I'm a psychiatrist.  I work for the County -- I don't work for the police. My only concern is your well being -- do you understand that?
I see.  You don't remember assaulting a police officer...several officers?
You don't have a driver's license, James?  Or a Social Security card?
Why not?  Most people have some ID.
A jail?  Prison?
Why do you think there aren't any germs in the air, James?
What year do you think it is?
It was some lady.  She didn't know anything.
I have the...strangest feeling I've met you before...a long time ago, perhaps. Were you ever...?
It's just a shot to calm you.
Did something terrible happen to you when you were a child?  Something so bad...?
You were in my dream just now.  Your hair was different, but I'm sure it was you.
You were very upset.  You're always very upset in the dream, but I never knew it was you before.
We need gas.
You were going to run out off gas on purpose, weren't you?
What have you done?  Did you...kill someone?
I need help all right.  They're coming after me.
Just like that?  You were in prison?
The boy in the well.  How did you know that was just a hoax?
What does this mean to you?
I think I've seen this movie before. When I was a kid.  It was on TV.
You were in my dream just now.  I didn't recognize you.
That's what they were up to!  Freeing animals!
I know this place! ... This is my dream.
Who would you call, Mr. Cole, who would straighten everything out?
Why don't I escape, that's what you were going to ask me, right?  'Cause I'd be crazy to escape!  I'm all taken care of, see?  I've sent out word.
They hurt you!
What're you writing?  You a reporter?
JOSE!
I asked you, why did you volunteer?
But you know what's real now?
He should have been in restraints.  It was bad judgment on your part, plain and simple.  why not just cop to it?
-- so they get there and they ask the guy real nice for some kind of i.d., and he gets agitated, starts screaming about viruses. Totally irrational, totally disoriented, doesn't know where he is, what day it is, alla that stuff.  All they got was his name.  They figure he's stoned out of his mind, it's some kinda psychotic episode, so they're gonna bring him...
You have him in restraints.
What?  What did you say?
Hey!  You there!
Don't call me old man.  Ain't you got no respect, boy?
Yeah I want something.  I want you to run over to that machine and get me a pop.
I think you'd better give your pooch a sip.  He looks sick.
Maybe I do.
The day wasn't so bad.  We all got through it all right.
I'll take a piece of that bet. I say it doesn't come up five times each side.
Thirty-bucks?  That's it?
One-hundred-thirteen degrees.  That was back in July of forty-seven. Now there ain't no way it's gonna be hotter than that.
You ain't nothing but an old fool.
A coin's got two sides.  When you flip it there's a fifty-fifty chance it'll be heads or tails.  Boyd thinks if you flip a coin ten times half the time it'll come up each side.
And what are you?  A rocket scientist?
One way, or round trip?
Please, you don't understand.  I have to get out of here.  They're going to come looking for me. They're going to kill me.  If I can't get this ticket then I'm going to have to do things to get out of here.  I don't want to hurt anybody, I just want to leave.
Will he be back soon?
I'll be back in a couple of hours. And be careful with her, will you?
Just banged my head.  It was an accident.
How much?
About an hour and a half, because that's all the longer I've been gone.
That's a Ford, not a Ferrari.  You going to tell me no one else in this shit hole drives a Ford?
Then you're only a hundred-forty- five in the hole.  Now why don't you just take your Visa Express Silver Card, call Karl Malden and have him send you the money lickity split.
Hell, I've had days I would gladly trade with a whippin' dog.  Ain't much you can do when you feel like that 'cept tough it out.
You think bad, and bad is what you get.
Well, now, you just know all there is about bein' a mechanic, don't you?  I can't do unauthorized work. I suppose I can just let you ride out of here with a bad gasket.  Then you get in an accident and get killed.  Or worse.  Who they gonna blame then?  They gonna blame me, and there goes my reputation.
Is that an insult?  Are you insulting me.
No!
What you want?
Two-hundred dollars in hundred- dollar bills.  And this morning you was broke.
I don't want no dirty money.  I run an honest business.
Lord!  Put the baby in the icebox. Killed the poor thing.
That yours, Mrs. McKenna?
Is that right?  Can't say as I blame you for wanting to head out for a bit.  I know I've had my fill of this town.  Sixteen years I've been the law and order here.  So long I forgot why I ever wanted the job in the first place.  Help people, I guess.  Keep the peace.  Problem is there's so much peace around here they don't much need me.  Got a lot of speeders, but they're speeding through miles of nothing so I can't hardly blame them.  Other than that, well, there ain't much to steal.  I reckon that the last big crime we had was, what would you say Mrs. McKenna?  A murder?
That wasn't so bad.  What's thirty- some-thousand to rich folks like you?  It didn't hurt a bit.
I put up new drapes, Jake.
They look nice.
Oh my God, Jake, no.  If it is someone they'll go away.  Or call the police.  Don't go out there.
Maybe I don't want you to.
You're pretty full of yourself, aren't you?
It's Grace.
Drove into Sierra?  What for?
Somewhere else.  I've never been anywhere else.  Just once.  Years ago.  Went to the state fair.  It was nice, but it wasn't nothing.
That's good.  Cools you right off.  I saw you watching me.
Where'd you learn to do that?
A medicine man?
My face tell you all that?
No more drapes to hang.  Now what should we do?
I think I can find my own way back to into town.
I'm guessing no.
And I take it things didn't much work out the way you planned.
All this nothing?  I've spent my life in this stinking desert.  It doesn't get to Jake like it got to me.  He doesn't mind being out here. He doesn't mind being nothing but a land broker.  Big fish in a small pond, he says.  More like a little fish in a dried up watering hole.
John?  John where are you going?
Shit!
I mean it, Grace.  I'm getting out of here, and I want to take you with me.
I came back for you; this morning I came back.  Before I even knew about the money. You're what I want.
You don't know?  Jesus Christ! Don't you think you should have found out before we killed him?
Oh, that's great.  We killed Jake because you heard him talk about some money that you've never seen. That's fucking brilliant!
What?
I shot him.
You're crazy, you know that!? You're fucked up!?
I know.  He was to take the fucking money.
<u>We</u> killed Jake.  And it's a big difference.  You kill an old man, that's one thing.  Nobody cares about an old man.  You kill a cop and they never stop looking for you. Never.
The trunk.  It's locked.
I swear to you that's all that happened.  I haven't so much as set foot in your bedroom.
What brings you to Sierra?
Where you headed?
Live there?
She does at that.  I knew when I married her she was a free spirit. A woman with her looks and a man my age; what was I to expect?  But you see a woman like that in a town like this and you don't think, you do. So, I married her.  What are you to do, eh?  Women.
Hungry?
You said you'd cut that up with the man who did her in.
I'm not rambling.
Bullshit.  You wanted me to kill her.
I guess I might as well get this done with.
I went to your place.  We talked, just like you told me.  We drove out into the desert . . .
No.
You know what I mean.
You love her, but you hate her?
Drop it, Jake.
Jake, how much were you going to pay me to do the job?
I came for Grace.
Then maybe this afternoon.  When I sent you to kill my wife you ended up sexing her instead.
Is that what happened?  Did you even make it out to the desert, or did you just ply the afternoon between my sheets?
You're right.  I don't give a damn about her.  But to fuck a man's wife behind his back?  That just makes a fool out of him.  I don't like being made a fool of.
I asked you a question.
Hey, Mister.  You gotta quarter?
Got any requests?
But you was going to fight for me.
Don't be afraid of him none.  I don't care what he does to you, we can still be together.
Oh, that tears it, Mister.  I'm gonna bust you up but good.  I'm gonna bust you into a million pieces and then . . . and then bust those pieces up, and then . . . and then spread them all around.  That's what I'm gonna do.  You don't know what you're dealing with, Mister.  I'm crazy.  I'm psycho crazy.
I'm doing what any man would do if he'd been offended.  I'm beating you up.
John, what a surprise.  I expected to be seeing you, not talking to you over the phone.
The old lady?
I think you might just want to do as I say.
Got any cold soda?
Yeah I want something.  I want you to run over to that machine and get me a pop.
What the hell are you keeping a dead dog around for?
Maybe I do.
I think I've heard that before.
Night is when you want to sleep, but the dry heat keeps you tossin' and turnin'. It's when you wish the sun was bakin' high in the sky so you could see what it is you're afraid of.
Afraid of it?  Boy, I live in the dark. All cause of a woman who made me this way. People are afraid of what they can't see. I can't see nuthin', so it's all the same to me.  Kiss from a beautiful woman, kissy kissy kiss, a lick from a dog, slurp, slurp, the kiss of death . It's all the same to me.
Well, don't say I didn't warn you when things go your way.
Time's up. Any last words of wisdom?
Then maybe you should've. Look, pal, I wasn't making a play for your girl.
Oh, that tears it, Mister.  I'm gonna bust you up but good.  I'm gonna bust you into a million pieces and then ... and then bust those pieces up, and then ... and then spread them all around.  That's what I'm gonna do.  You don't know what you're dealing with, Mister.  I'm crazy.  I'm psycho crazy.
Who the hell is this!?
Say, what happened to your hand?
You've got to be--
"Bobby Cooper." What brings you to Superior, Coop?
Hey!
She does at that.  I knew when I married her she was a free spirit.  A woman with her looks and a man my age; what was I to expect?  But you see a woman like that in a town like this and you don't think, you do. So, I married her.  What are you to do, eh? Women.
Don't play simple with me, Jake. You're a betting man. You want me to spell it out for you? I'll kill Grace if you cut me in on the money.
I'm not rambling.
Bullshit.  You wanted me to kill her.
You meant it.
You drive a hard bargain, but I had a feeling you were my boy when I met you.
If you can't trust the man you've hired to kill your wife ...? The thing is it's got to look like an accident; that's the thing. If it doesn't, then it's no good.  I won't get a dime, and it's my neck that'll be on the chopping block while you're living it up somewhere.
How the hell should I know?  I've never had a wife killed before. Jesus Christ! <u>You</u> want this job, you don't know how to do this? I guess I should have hired a professional.
That's my gun... That fucking Darrell!
You ain't from Oz.  Oz is in that movie.
But you was going to fight for me.
He's not my boyfriend.  I mean, I let him take me out and stuff, but I ain't spoken for.  Not yet that is.
You're too late, Toby.  We're going to get in his fancy car and ride off and leave you behind.
Will he be back soon?
Look, Harlin, I've got places to be.
Great!
Twenty-after-ten.
Hey.
Hundred-fifty.
Then you ain't gonna have the car.
Then you're only a hundred-forty-five in the hole.  You can keep that dollar. Now why don't you just take your American Express Gold Card, and call that guy with the big schnooz on TV and have him send you the money lickity split.
...got no day, got no date.  Probably ain't worth a duck's fart . This one here cost me $3.75 and it's got every doodad you can imagine. No sir I'll stick with this .
What you want?
I call the sheriff.
My name is Bobby.  Now I'm not a stranger anymore.  See how easy it is for us to get to know each other, beautiful?
Accident.
You're not from around here, are you?
You're lucky you didn't break down in the desert.  Day like today, you'd be dead in no time. When you leaving?
Where you coming from?
I guess.  I've got an ego same as any man.
My face tell you all that?
There.  All done.  Lift me down.
You can let go of me now. I'm safe. How do they look?
I like them.  I was sick of looking at this room.  I think they add a little life.
I think I can find my own way back to into town.
Did you ever?
I take it things didn't much work out the way you planned.
I don't know how.
In <u>cash</u>?
What about us?
Except I can't get you out of my head, Grace. 
Why?  Am I making you hot, or does the truth scare you?
Are you sure?...  About me, I mean?
Bobby?  What the hell's the matter with you?
I got the money all packed.  I put the jeep and his caddy in the garage. People'll think maybe me and Jake went away.  Buy us some time...I know a back road we can take.
I can't see it.
Don't you think I would've done it if I wanted to? What can I do to make you relax, baby?
Time to go for a walk, Jake.
And I love you too.
Where ya goin'?
That's a nasty cut you got there.
There was a young fellow over at Jamilla's today when it got hit.  Way she tells it he got whacked around good by one of the robbers.
Mr. Arkady, honest, I ad to beat it outta there before the cops showed. So now I don't have a cent to my name. I can't even get my car out of the garage.  I tell you, Mister...  if it weren't for bad luck I wouldn't have nay fuckin' luck at all, you know?   So, I was wondering if you could wire me a hundred fifty-dollars so I could get my car out of this garage, see?  The bus depot here has a Western Union thing.  And of course I'll pay it back with the rest of the money.
Yeah, if you could send it care of...
Out of here.
One way, or round trip?
Morning Grace.
I put up new drapes, Jake.
Ya little bitch, you like it don't you! You like it this way -- rough and hard. Gotta go fuck around on me, like your Mama, but you always gotta come home to Daddy, don't you, cause you know Daddy's the best.
What's the matter?
Toby!  Toby Tucker, leave him alone!
Whoa, what kind of accent you got there? You one of them Russians?
Get out of the car, spread them. You can jawbone all you want or you have the right to <u>shut the fuck up</u>! You commie motherfucker. Either way you're goin' to the can.
How old is Jeb?
I'm listening.
Is Jeremy okay?
Is there anything else you wanted to ask me while I'm up?... When was the last time you wore pink? When was the last time you drank soup standing up? Final call for strange questions at two in the morning.
Soft and Wet, by the Artist Formerly Known as Prince.
What about the game?
You've never been sick?
What's this about? This is obviously some scam. Is this where you tell me one of those pictures is like an investment?
I thought he was carrying something.
Yes.
I am. I'm helping him with the sale.
He's kind of a miracle.
He's got the most beautiful eyes... The hell kind of question is that? He's a guy.
He going pro in the draft. They say he can run the fifty--
Don't be scared.
He doesn't look very threatening.
We're going to prevent any substantial atrophy of your good leg with this.  It works the quadriceps.
How so?
For a second there I thought you were a fanatic.
Where'd you get the money, huh?
That Kid... he's just a... boy. And that other one, Bill, being true to his wife...
Why, if you were to point a pistol at a King or a Queen, sir, I can assure you your hand would shake as though palsied...
Where's Little Bill for Christ sake?
He's coming ain't he?
...wouldn't let you settle it, huh?
Some big guy beat the shit out of me.  I guess I must look a lot like you, huh?
I thought I was gone. See them birds? Most times I wouldn't even notice them birds much. But I'm noticin' 'em real good 'cause I thought I was dead.
Them other two, they been takin' advances on the payment.
Yeah. See?
What I heard was that you fell off your horse drunk and broke your neck.
Mmmm pistols.
We got one of them fuckers, Sheriff, out by Cow Creek, we...
No... but I guess he will soon enough. Had a Spencer rifle on him an' he was...
Hit your finger, huh?
There ain't no snakes in here, Mister Hendershot.
It's only a b-b-b-book...
Duke.
I believe that to be an accurate description of the events, sir... albeit there is a certain poetry to the language which...
First off... Corky didn't carry two pistols, though he should of.
Bam! That Walker Colt blew up in his hand... which was a failing common to that model. Now if Corky would have really had two guns instead of just a big dick he could have defended himself to the end.
But if the other fellow is quicker and fires first...
But... if he doesn't miss?
I was watchin' you... seein' if you was followed.
They... they killed him. I... thought you know that. I thought you knew because...
The questions Little Bill asked him... what sort of questions was they?
An' Little Bill killed Ned for what I done?
Yeah, I guess so.
He said that, huh?
I ain't like that no more, Kid. Whiskey done it as much as anythin' I guess.  I ain't touched a drop in ten years. My wife, she cured me of it... cured me of drink an' wickedness.
Been gone near three years now.
Don't tell nobody about the reward an' all. Don't need no other gunmen tryin' to collect.
Well, we was. Like you said, I changed my mind an'...
Well, now Kid, there's two of these cowboys, ain't that so? Better there's three of us... maybe them cowboys got friends. Maybe...
Well, what were you lookin' at anyhow?
An' how there was two deputies up close pointin' rifles at you... had you dead to rights... an' how you pulled out a pistol an' blew them both away to hell... an' only took a scratch yourself.  Uncle Pete told me he never seen nothin' like it, shootin' your way out of a scrape like that.
Get some sleep, Kid.
He ain't killed.
Yeah, he's in there.
Yeah, I guess so.
You... gonna take... the money?
You could have it. All of it.
Wh-wh-who did you kill first?
How long since you shot a gun at a man?  Nine... ten years?
It ain't nothin', don't fret it.  She don't like it much, you goin' off with me.
I ain't blamin' her, Ned, I ain't holdin' it against her.  She knew me back then... an' she seen what a no good sonofabitch I was... an' she won't allow how I've changed. She just don't know how I ain't like that no more.
Some fucker's shootin' at us.
God damn it, Bill, it's rainin'.
HOW MANY LEFT GODDAMIT?
All that money... I mean... did you...?
I guess you didn't kill nobody then.
Well, this here's Ned Logan... Ned, this here's the Schofield Kid, nephew of Pete Sothow an'...
You was right to change your mind, Kid.
Fuck you.
How many men you killed?  Ain't you gonna answer?
Well, I guess I woulda at least pulled my pistol an...
Depends what he told you.  About Bill, you mean?
I can't spot 'em myself but you could. That red-haired one, you could spot a half-mile off, I bet.
A boy came across a body on the beach this morning. Thrown clear when the boat burned. Shot once in the head. Two guys from the F.B.I. just identified him.                     +
&lt;&lt;Keyser Soze. Keyser Sate. I've seen his face. I see it when I close my eyes.&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;Don't be stupid.&gt;&gt;
...and the desk Sergeant is actually trying to tell me he can't release you? Can you believe that? You weren't even charged. New York police - Jesus. I want to take pictures of your face to bring to the D.A. first thing in the morning.
They want more time to think about investing.
Give me some credit. I got you this far, let's go to the grand jury. This is never going to stop if we -
Come home, Dean.
That's enough, Edie.
I know who he is.
I hope so, too, Mr. Kint. Can I get you something to drink?
I'd say you've gotten on his main and central nerve, McManus.
Forget him. It's not important. I was trying to make a point.
How many times have you been in a line- up? It's always you and four dummies. The P.D. pays homeless guys ten bucks a head half the time. No way they'd line five felons in the same row. No way. And what the hell is a voice line-.up? A public defender could get you off of that.
This is not right.
Why don't you just calm down'
Me too.
They - That's bullshit. They don't operate anymore.
What fence? Who?
Fenster and Hockney?
No killing?
What is it Keaton?
Let's say for example -
You set up the line-up.
Ahh, Mr. Hockney. Do join us.
A little of both.
Weapons. Misdemeanor two.
You know Ruby is in Attica?
That was all Fenster and McManus.
I don't know about that.
No. But I'm sure Keaton's dead.
I've got immunity now. What can you possibly offer me?
Where's your head, Agent Kujan? Where do you think the pressure's coming from? Keyser Soze - or whatever you want to call him - knows where I am right now. He's got the front burner under' your ass to let me go so he can scoop me up ten minutes later. Immunity was just to deal with you assholes. I got a whole new problem when I post bail.
A man in a suit with a slim build. Tall.
Verbal, he left you behind for a reason. If you all knew Soze could find you anywhere, why was he ready to send you off with the money when he could have used you to take the boat?
No provisions, nothing. My clients testimony for his immunity.
Counselor, I will prosecute your client.
What did he find?
No -- we don't want this case in court.
I know that answer.  If we went to trial would we win?
That was our insurance company's recommendation.
Nothing that we can do can make that woman well.
This is going to drive the ante up.
That's the call that I'm waiting for.
Whatever the `truth' is, let's hear that.  You were her doctor.
Say it.
Mary Rooney, the obstetrical nurse...
Well, many reasons, actually...
She'd aspirated vomitus into her mask...
...and her heart stopped and she wasn't getting oxygen.
...You brought thirty years of medical experience to bear.  Isn't that what you did?
You reached down into death.  Now, isn't that right?
Engaged to render an opinion.  For a price.  Is that correct?  You're being paid to be here today?
...I'm sure it is, but this is Massachusetts, Doctor.  Certified in Internal Medicine?
Neurology?
How old are you?
Thank you, your Honor.  We object to the copy of the admissions form as incompetemt and essentially hearsay evidence and cite McGee versus State of Indiana, U.S. 131 point 2 and 216 through 25 of the Uniform Code:  'The admission of a duplicate document in preference to an existing original must presuppose the possibility of alteration and so must be disallowed.'  And, your Honor, having given the Plaintiff the leeway we would like your ruling on this issue now:  we object to the admission of the Xerox form.
The document is disallowed, the jury will be advised not to consider the testimony of Kathy Costello regarding the Xerox form.    It's unsubstantiated and we  can't accept a copy in preference to the original...
You are aware of the penalties for perjury...?
Just now...
They lied.
And why, please tell us, would you think that?
You said you're gonna call me up. You didn't call me up.  Who do you think you are?    Who do you think you are...?
...she went in complaining of stomach cramps.  Good doctor would have doubted the information on the chart.
Then what good would it do to ruin the reputation of two men, to help a girl whose life's not going to be changed in the least?   You know what CODE BLUE means?
I...given the limits of your question, that's correct.
I'm going to take you to the home to see the girl...
And you wrote that...
Yes.
Well, well, when can we meet again. I'd like to get a deposition..
Now, have you boys tried to resolve your little difficulty because that certainly would save the Commonwealth a lot of time and bother.
Is the Plaintiff ready?
Do we have time this morning to... All right.  Mr. Galvin, you want to continue now, or we can resume with Dr. Thompson this afternoon.
Yes, Mr. Galvin?
Galvin, look, many years ago...
Are you done?
Exception!
Mr. Galvin's...
This is Mr. Wallace in Subscriptions?
This is Miss Costello...?
What Hotel are you staying at?
I'm a lawyer.
They might.  Yes.  That's the point ...is that they might...you see, the jury wants to believe.  They're all cynics, sure, because they want to believe.  I have to go in there tomorrow to find twelve people to hear this case.   I'm going to see a hundred people and pick twelve.  And every one of them it's written on their face, `This is a sham.  There is no justice...' but in their heart they're saying, 'Maybe...maybe...'
Maybe I can do something right.
Would you like me to leave...?   Is this a bad time --?
Is this a bad time.
That's not the question.  It's over.  Do you think that it's my fault?  If I'd...if I'd...I never should have taken it.  There was no way that I was going to win.
You do what you want.  You want to leave...You want to go kill yourself?
You want me to tell you it's your fault?  It probably is.  What are you going to do about it?   I thought it's not over till the jury comes in.
Not if you don't grow up...
You're pressuring yourself...
Dr. Gruber.
I had an appointment at his office, I think I must have got it wrong. We had a meeting...
I...please.  My wife...my wife's prescription has run out.  If I can call him...
No, no, no.  I have to talk to him.  If I can only call him..
Mick.  Mick.  Mick...
So what?
How are you holding up?
Who?  They're all testifying. Everybody who was in the O.R.'s going to take the stand.
Uh...the admitting nurse...
...yeah...good...
I talked to Johnnie White at the Bar Association.   The broad used to work for one of Concannon's partners in New York awhile ago.   She wanted to move to Boston.    How badly did she hurt us, Joe?
I'm ... Mrs. Doneghy?  I'm Frank Galvin ... why didn't you go in?
... I know.  I went ...
He saw her at the Northern Care...
I spoke to her, and everything is all right.
She told me.
Uh-huh.  My nephew's going to be staying with us in a few months, so I stopped by.
Thank you.
Who told you that?
D'you ask the patient when did she last eat?
One hour.
Well, well, well.  Huh?
Dr. Towler...
...of the procedures...
...they start again three minutes earlier...
Franky can't make it.  He had an appointment he forgot, he's going to see you later.  I'm Mickey Morrissey, we're supposed to get to know each other.
How'd you get into the shipbuilding business, Gavin?
Interesting business.
You don't have to do it for a living.
If I told you I believe that his happened to my wife, what would you say?
How can I see her, to know her?
Something else. My wife, Madeleine, has several pieces of jewelry that belonged to Carlotta. She inherited them. Never wore them, they were too old-fashioned... until now. Now, when she is alone, she gets them out and looks at them handles them gently, curiously... puts them on and stares at herself in the mirror... and goes into that other world... is someone else again.
No, she's all right. She's still here. But I'll get her home soon.
No, I happened to see you come in, and I thought --
What do you want to know?
Tomorrow night? Well --
Oh, Well, thank very much. But no thanks.
No? Then what?
No, Judy, I'm not going to move! Please! Stay in the chair!
But I like that one, Scottie.
Judy, it can't make much difference to you. I just want to see how you'd look and I know it won't be the same, but --
I wish you'd leave me alone. I want to go away.
The color of your hair...
But why? Why here?
I'm scared.
Lucky for me you were wandering about. Thank you again. I've been terrible bother to you.
I... suddenly felt such a fool.
Would you like some coffee?
Meet again, sometime.
No.
Don't you think it's sort of a waste for the two of us to...
How can you be sure?
How old?
Their true name is Sequoia Sempervirens: always green, ever- living.
And no birds sing.
Where were you born?
What else?
A portrait? Do you ever see a portrait?
If I could find the key... find the beginning put it together...
I'm not mad. I'm not mad. And I don't want to die, but there's someone inside me, there's a somebody else, and she says I must die... Scottie, don't let me go!
I should have phoned... but I wanted to see you... be with you...
No, don't go away!
You've been there before. You've seen it.
Madeleine --
Let me go into the church alone.
Oh, yes!
Oh, dear! Has she done something wrong?
Yes, that's it. Sweet name, isn't it?  Foreign. But sweet.
No... she only comes to sit. Two or three times a week. And I never ask questions, you know. As long as they're well behaved. I must say that I've wondered --
Not with my Acrophobia, Midge. If I dropped a pencil on the floor and bent down to pick it up, it could be disastrous!
It's brand new. Revolutionary uplift. No shoulder straps, no back straps, but does everything a brassiere should do. It works on the principle of the cantilever bridge.
Step number two.
Easy, now.
Johnny!
Now, that's the kind of greeting a girl likes.  None of this "hello you look wonderful" stuff. Just a good straight "who do you know" --
Here you are.
Is she pretty?
What was this desperate urge to see me?
Oh, I'm having a wonderful time! I've gone back to my first love... painting.
Yes... the Beautiful Carlotta... the Sad Carlotta...
No, that's not it. Nothing like it.
Oh, yes! It may need some slight alterations, but it is madam's size.  All right, dear.  We'll have it for you to try in a moment.
The stripper's here.
Jesus.
They'll get us on accesory to murder.
Why?
More.
Wait!
Everybody shut up. LISTEN TO ME!
Are you sure this was an accident?
Stop it! Listen to me. Let's just take a second here and take hold of the situation, OK? Let's just review our options here.
I'm calling the police.
How do you figure?
Well what the fuck are we supposed to do?
Who? What are you talking about?
I'm talking about DNA samples, fiber optics, search parties, they got infrared scanners, FBI scientists. They figure this shit out. They always figure it out.
No way.
I got a migraine like a little monkey kicking in the side of my skull, Mike Tyson with a fucking sledge hammer trying to crack...
I don't understand where this personal attack is coming from...
That's right.
Is everything okay?
She's in there!
But not tonight.
Keith Richards, Dean Martin...
I got her arm.
You said that Boyd.
Oh, Jesus...call the police.
Nobody knows she's here.
All right people. New plan. Not even a new plan so much as a modification of the old plan.
It goes; "Today is the first day of the rest of our lives."
Boyd...What have we done?
I don't know! I just want to get married.
What's your point?
Just do it.
Take care of business.
I'm talking about Lois having relaxed her anxiety. Only deal is...you still got Micheal there?
Blood money. Insurance dollars that you have thus fucking far decided not to tell me about at all. In no way have you mentioned that money. And I find that to be very very offensive.
And if you think you can fuck me, don't. Cause I'm fucking insulated Fisher. Protected. Backed up on floppy. Do you get me? I want my fucking money!
False.
I am a lover. In Africa, you can stay king as long as you can service your women every night.
Then what do they have?
Take Mexico.
This is going to stop right now. Right now!
Okay Micheal, let's go.  Upsy daisy big guy.
Can't we do it on the phone?
Why is this Kid staring at me?
Florist?
Caterer?
Why did you forget the tent check?
Don't you dare.
It's a bachelor party. You sort of have to do it before the wedding.
Charles Moore for instants.
He's a great chef.
You expect more what?
That's absurd.
Go down to the seat place and straighten this out.
I need your help.
Just call and let me know that your okay.
Yeah. Nesting.
"Darli...ing you, ewe ewe ewe, send me, Darli...ing you, ewe ewe ewe, mend me.
Yeah baby. Everything's great.
Yeah. Sure.
No way.
I know.
No one's discussing it. I'm just gonna run Micheal home. I'll be right back.
Don't even.
What are you talking about?
You fucked a prostitute?
You killed a prostitute.
I could have done it better. I'm a fucking ball-buster I am.
Just kills me...
Well, I'm in the middle of my Goddamn toast here.
I'm not breathing right.
Do you hear buzzing Fish?
Dad used to bring home these sparklers to me and Adam. Out back we'd light 'em up. The three of us. We'd hold 'em up to the sky and watch the explosions of light. Sparks. And dad would be all... "Get ready"..."watch for it"..."here it comes," here comes the "wahoo".
I appreciate it. I do, but...Maybe you ought to just ease up om yourself a bit.
Boyd...I don't know man...It just seems to me that ever since you took Tony Robbins self-help thing...you're all fucked-up in the head.
The first day.
Greenpeace.
He said he was the Brain Trust. Said he was smarter than all of us. He started reading "Atlas Shrugged," staring at himself in the mirror.
You alright?
We will.
Smart. Smart. Smart. Think big picture, take your time. I wish I had.
Fucking desert.
I'll come to you tonight.
Keep quiet. These miserable brats only get in the way.
Where's the camera?
They've got a real hen house here! You can't hear yourself speak.
Don Amalio!
Excellent. What a charming, peaceful place, Uncle.
Sometimes these things happen because of inexperience. Sometimes it's because of...
If you only knew ... When I was young I was full of idealism. I wanted to do something on a big scale for others, something to show my great love for humanity. But as soon as I tried to do something about it, I became afraid that I would be laughed at and I felt like a fool ... and so I went back into my shell.
Yes, I don't want you ever to leave this house.
Think about it. Don't hurry. Think it over.
What for? She'll only look at me that way again ... I couldn't. You go. Perhaps she'll listen to you. Try to convince her.
They told us you'd be back tomorrow ...
Me?
It won't take but a minute. It's a votive offering for a lady who was cured just when she was dying of fever. Our Lady of the Helpless granted her a favor.
Not in that way; you're always looking for company.
Why the bad temper?
She's mad.
So, Ramona!
Shouldn't I be? You, on the other hand ...
You see how much you like her?
And this chest?
Miss Viridiana ...
Jorge. You frightened me. What's happening to you?
What are you doing here? Get out.
Is that all you're going to devote your life to?
It's for people!
You'll soon find out, you liar!
How do you do, Miss Viridiana!
It's a very big one.
What's going on, Moncho?
In you go! Moncho, lead the way!  You stay here.
You have decided to leave, Moncho.
I hardly know him. I saw him only once, some years ago. I can't even remember him.
Good morning. You weren't expecting me, were you?
Ever since yesterday, when we heard by chance about the tragedy, we have been very anxious for you. Why didn't you write? I would have come immediately.
Give the little girl to me. Come here, sweetheart. Are you ready?
Would you mind telling me what I did wrong to you to deserve your insults?
She looks like a sick marrow!
Hello.
Good morning, Rita. How are we today?
What?
In English, please.
What are they doing in Los Feliz?
Barnes wouldn't kill two innocent guards.
Before you, nobody else had gotten close enough to Sid 6.7 to take a shot at him. Hell, nobody else had even been able to start tracking him before he got to them first.  New scar  you making it okay in there?
But with the six months off I get for being your guinea pig, I've only got to survive another 17 years, 5 months, and 23 days.
She's going to help you understand what makes Sid 6.7 tick.
Sid 6.7 is now armed.
She saved your life, Parker. She didn't have to, but she did.
When this is over, will you get this goddam thing out of my head?
Why didn't anybody tell me?!
What's the assignment?
That's also where Mr. Barnes lost his arms to Mathew Grimes' booby trap. What's your point, Dr. Carter?
What did you find out?
Demolition teams have searched everywhere in and around the hotel. I don't know where...
I haven't been working on anything.
Get that fucking thing away from me!
It's better than real. It's synthetic flesh. Synthetic blood. Synthetic organs...  It's a physiological machine.
You need a maid.
Should I have?
All they want to produce around here is mediocrity!
She's some of your finest work, Daryl.
You catching my drift?
SID  NO!!!
A little less than yesterday.
Go to hell.
Remember a few years ago when music schools were using a computerized teaching tool that accidently started frying kids' brains?
I am impressed.
Give me your wrist.
She's beautiful, you know?
Whatever he was doing here was only the start.
It's not just Sid 6.7's performances that are increasing. Stars need bigger and bigger audiences.  Whatever Sid is going to do next, it's going to involve media.
The rally's a little obvious as a target, don't you think?
Sid 6.7 isn't Grimes.
You've already fulfilled the terms of your pardon. You stopped Sid 6.7 and you've got his module. You're free to go  right now.  Why are you going to do this?
Then shoot him already.
Where's John?
What C-4...was Cox talking about?
Do they have to look so...robotic?
...tonight...
No, this is great.
Ames here.  <u>Yessir</u>... 
And...she's not an Illegal Immigrant?  Is she?  Can I see her "chart?"  Because...
A small, "calico" kitten, sir.  "Calico." 
A new <u>take</u> on the...  Well, sir, we're coming back, we'd like you to try it out, this evening...
Izzat the thing...
And?  NO.  I don't wanna know.  What do you <u>mean</u> "and..."?
You can't tell this story.  He's not kidding you.  You can't tell this story.  <u>You</u> knew that.  The pay off was, you get to be Ambassador, or...
I'm concerned about the driver of the rig.
Three minutes.  It couldn't have been over three minutes, the Secret Service...
Don't you want to know if it's true?
It won't hold.
Tell me again.
Yes
The thing with the Yellow Ribbon...
The hostages, but that was a naturally-occuring...  It was a put-up job?  But where was the, where was the money in that?
I <u>live</u> for midnight, when I can tear another of those suckers off.  Watcha got for me?
And carrying.  The National Flower of Albania, something..... Now Is it some Festival?  Some <u>Harvest</u> Festival, something...
...got to be <u>something</u>.  She gives him the sacred...  And tells him:  this is the Traditional Harvest Offering, given to the Man who Ties the First Sheaf, the last sheaf, whatever the fuck it is...
Stanley Moss, Ladeesngennlmen... And she says...
Find out is there <u>any</u> chance we can get some rain tomorrow, <u>will</u> you...?
Catching up on his reading.  Asked about you, sends his thanks.
Maybe he's just a <u>patriot</u>.
<u>Nashville</u>...?
And I'd like to point out that I've been on prescription <u>medication</u>, the side-effects of which...
Ronnie says we don't need'em for another four days.  ...s'there a problem?
Pride of a job-well-done...
"...where's my pill..."
...where is my pill?
AS WE LOOK UP, WE SEE THE PRESIDENT BITING HIS LIP, AND CONTINUING WITH THE SPEECH.
OVER A SLEEPING BREAN, STRETCHED OUT ON A POOLCHAIR, GRACE, THE SECRETARY, COMES OUT ON TO THE POOL AREA, HOLDING THE SHOT OF A SMALL, FOREIGN LOOKING CHILD, IN FRONT OF A PILE OF RUBBLE. SHE SHOWS IT TO MOSS.
THE CROWDS AT ANDREW'S AIRKORCE BASE, THE "OLD SHOE" BANNERS, THE "COURAGE, MOM," BANNERS.  THE STILL BAND.  A SHOT OF THE BANDMASTER, SURREPTITIOUSLY, GLANCING AT HIS WATCH.
I gotta get something, I gotta get ...shoes?  Ties? Hats...?  Good.  Good. 
Whaddaya think?
Well, I'm sure that speaks very well of you and for your parents.  But if forced to choose between the security of the country and the security of your Job, which would you pick.  And, while you hesitate, permit me to suggest that they are one and the same.  Your country and your job.
Would you go to War to do that? 
Trade Re1ations.
And you're here <u>why</u>...?
String a few together.  All I need's eleven,
It's like being a producer, Mr. Moss.  The Things in Trouble.  Somebody's got to wade in, save the thing.  You get the Actors get up there, and strut and <u>Posture</u>.  But somebody, knows what's what, got to jump in and Save the Thing. 
Who?
"They Got To Know?"  <u>Stan</u>...?  Get with it.  Who Killed Kennedy...?  I read the first draft of the Warren Report, said he was killed by a Drunk <u>Driver</u>.  You watched the Gulf War.  What did you see?  Day after day, the one "Smart Bomb" falling into a building. The <u>truth</u>, I was in the building when they <u>shot</u> that shot, they shot it in a studio, Falls Church Virginia, 1/10th scale model of a building.
They got to have something that we want.
What do we have that they want?
Well, you could <u>have</u> one, but it'd be a very ineffective war...  We're <u>done</u> in 10 days...
He can't respond to the Allegations.  I don't care <u>how</u> many girlscouts are picketing the ... look, look, look, we're coming home with <u>Gold</u>.  Eh? Tell him to hold firm for <u>two hours</u>... coming home with Gold.
What?
Mmm...
Hey, our job ends at the Finish Line.
If they can give Kissenger the Peace Prize, I wouldn't be surprised to wake up and find I'd won the Preakness.
The Albanian Campaign.
...a masterpiece...
He's going to be fine, aren't you boy...?
No, I don't think you can <u>do</u> that.
Stanley.  Stanley... you knew the... Stanley.  You knew the deal when you signed <u>on</u>.
I go with this here... 
Bunny:  I had an idea:  a Slinky, that falls <u>Up</u>...  Naa, we can figure that <u>out</u>.  What I'm wondering:  what do we <u>call</u> it...  You got my number... 
Public Domain.
Do it later...  Okay,  now, "The Little Girl," who is she, what is she doing?  She is....she's ...Okay, okay, it's an Albanian village... She is the victim of, she has been <u>relocated</u>, to, to, for the <u>terrorists</u>, the Government Labs...the, the... a <u>staging</u> area for their Atomic workshop.  They're torturing her family, because they have connections in Canada, which would permit the terrorists access to the American Border.
...by you?
And one of them is in love with the <u>sister</u> of...
What the fuck did you <u>mean</u>, "What kind of stuff?"?
...gimme some help...
Who the hell's out there? What are the arbs saying? It's gotta be a big hitter.
Grand Marnier.
... That's what you told us to say.
So whaddaya say pal, wanna play some doubles at Piping? Meet the membership? I got a little blonde named Mandy, about nineteen, avec cafe au lait boobs... she's mine but she's got a cousin who has great muffins.
...well, see him?
you coulda stayed at Bluestar and been a supervisor in instead of going customer relations by now, 'stead of going off and bein' a salesman.
I don't get it, you get a scholarship to NYU, you get 35,000 the first year, and 50 last year, where the hell is it?
...same, pain in the ass, god bless her, talks too much... gonna take her to Florida next month... west coast, near Tampa, like to get out for good, but can't afford it.
Don't start, alright.
Problem with money is you never have enough or you got too much -- and when you got it you're never happy 'cause somebody's always trying to take it away from you. Money's one giant pain in the ass y'ask me... thanks.
He's got your prick in his back pocket, son, and you're standing naked in the display window of Macy's. He's using you. Only you're too blind to see it.
...as far as being axed, I'm still here and as long as I am, I have a responsibility not just to me but to the union members I represent...
...thanks Natalie.
I don't know anything!
...and you don't have to put up a dime, Roger.
Gekko asked us into the Bluestar deal. We're reviewing the timetables, wanna come?
How do you do Mr. Gekko. I'm Bud Fox.
Within 45 seconds, a microprocessor computes your systolic and diastolic pressure. Has an LCD readout, and it's cost effective -- less than one visit to the doctor.
...going places, good junk bond department, you got the financing on that Syndicam deal.
...don't like airlines, lousy unions...
How do you know?
What about hard work?
The break up value is higher. It's worth 80.
You don't understand. I want to be surprised...astonish me, sport, new info, don't care where or how you get it, just get it... My wife tells me you put a move on Darien. Here's some inside info for you. That Euroflash GQ guy she's going with's got big bucks but he's putting her feet to sleep. Exit visas are imminent. So don't lose your place in line.  Oh, jeez, I wish you could see this. The lights coming up over the water. I've never seen a painting that captures the beauty of the ocean at this moment.  ...an old Russian proverb - "a fisherman always sees another fisherman from afar." I like you sport, I ever tell you that... Gordon, call me Gordon from now on.
Buddy, it's not a question of enough. It's a zero sum game, sport. Somebody wins and somebody loses. Money itself isn't lost or made, it's simply transferred from one perception to another. Like magic. That painting cost $60,000 10 years ago. I could sell it today for $600,000. The illusion has become real. And the more real it becomes, the more desperately they want it. Capitalism at its finest.
The richest one percent of this country owns half the country's wealth: 5 trillion dollars. One third of that comes from hard work, two thirds of it comes from inheritance, interest on interest accumulation to widows and idiot sons and what I do -- stock and real estate speculation. It's bullshit. Ninety percent of the American people have little or no net worth. I create nothing; I own. We make the rules, Buddy, the news, war, peace, famine, upheaval; the cost of a paper clip.  We pull the rabbit out of the hat while everybody else sits around their whole life wondering how we did it...  ...you're not naive enough to think we're living in a democracy are you, Buddy? It's the free market. You're one of us now...take advantage of it. You got the killer instinct, kid, stick with me. I got things to teach you...
Oh really. Home of the exposed brick wall and the  houseplant.
What if I have a previous engagement?
Let's get things straight, Bud. I'm not going to take a cut. I worked hard and you can't decorate a room in New York for less than $100,000. Curtains alone...
You got it all charted out don't you, like a stock projection.
I love you, baby. Did I tell you that sometime in the last 24 hours?
I'm sorry. I was afraid something like this could happen.
You really mean that?  What'd he promise you? To take you public? I guess without Gordon's money and seal of approval, I'm not such a hot investment anymore. You're just the best money can buy, Darien...
You may not believe this Bud but I really do care for you. I think we could've made a good team...but that's how it goes...
Bud! Where you been the last two days?
Mr. Mannheim, got a sure thing.  Anacott Steel.
What do you say we go get a suite at the Carlyle? Caviar? Champagne? Celebrate, just like the old times Sunshine.
You told him about us?
I want to ask you a big favor, Gordon. Please drop the Bluestar deal.
With all due respect, Mr. Gekko, what's to prevent you from doing the same thing?
Are you prepared to put that in writing?
I saw the greatest movie with mark last night
Businessman?
Yeah 
We need to talk. CHINA Yeah about what?
A little what? CHINA See.  You don't even speak French.
Your books Master Loftmore
She went to a waxwork party
Two of your friends left earlier MARK Uh huh.
No Mark. MARK Why not?
Well, it all started when a friend and I
Anyone else not coming?
No thank you sir we're fine.
Servants.  Oh isn't it terrible darling, two more people have disappeared
When - you're a big boy.  I mean you know it's bad for you
Stop saying things so loud!
He loves you very much.  He just--
It got so bad your father almost had to put me away.
Because he was worried about me.
Why is he worried?
What?
Your friend saw them.
I felt...pain.  That she'd been hurt by someone.  This is great.  I'm trying to intuit the emotions of a figment of my--
Yes?
Well maybe your wife...
That's not...It's not like that.
I wanted to apologize.
Your house is so beautiful.
Mrs. Frank?
You look a little old for a student.
Y'hear anything you'll let me know?
We were suite mates.
You are?
Oh my god.  You bought it.
Telling you...
In the window.  Norman's at work.
Wow.  I'm losing it.
Yes.  Now I talked to Sela and there's a guy, this Pakistani guy down in Hartford...
Oh God...you knew.
I got there first.  Stan covered up the pills and I had it out with Norman.  He seemed desperate not to lose you.  He promised to handle it.  And we all let it drop away.
I'm a terrible friend.
Claire, I have to show up for the--
It's today?
Whatcha reading?
Excellent.  Couple of Swedish sailor cells just gang divided a virginal cheerleader cell.
It's just she's been the focus for a while.
Wanna fool around?
Remember how we were?
Hi.
What are you doing here?
Didn't know he was dead, every stinking paper on the globe.
Did you tell her?
Get down!  He'll see.
Dressed?
Tonight?
You're not at the center.
Norman...
Sabotage?
The accident...?
Maybe you're right.  Maybe I'm losing my mind...
What?
Sweetheart, it was over a year ago.
No.  I'm afraid to ask what this is about.
The...
I thought it was Mrs. Feur, but it's not...
...I'm positive this time...
I came to work in the garden and I saw you with her...in my house.
Claire, please don't...
Leave her out of this!
Stop...
Can't you see, she's trying to kill us.
She's out there isn't she?  She's in the lake.
Don't I, Norman?  YOU KEPT THE FUCKING NECKLACE.  Of a woman you killed!
:What do you mean "They" are? Are you officially a woman now?
Going away doesn't mean you leave Lasher behind. He was on Rowan's deck - and the plane...  geography seems irrelevant now.
I have seen him again.  Last night.
There are two.
I ask only that you stay here, long enough to be - educated.  A few hours.
Don't tell Rowan about this.
on't know what else to do.  Maybe I just don't belong in her life.  well - I'm already out of her life.
Aren't they gauche...?   Those steel things are so - common.
You two sees like a perfect fit.   Only two mounths...?
Gifford Mayfair - I'll cook your tongue on a spit!    witches!
Who is this...?
But my mother...  Ellie said she died -
Who the hel1 -
...and why I put thirty years between you and the beautiful monster. To kill the legacy!    you are the sum of his desires -
- and he seemed okay.  Just banged his -
uh - then he - be just -
The wasps were meant for Michael - but there's only so much you can control, isn't there?  The great and powerful lasher - undone by a faulty ladder-..  Why would you hurt him...?!  Answer me.
--- and I have heard you from the beginning... from it's very first beat.
Go on. Rowan.  Go on.
There was no thought.  There was no act.    That is not what I am.
They like you ------- kids.
What do you see...?
Just one.  The bar's closed.
I was born, in New Orleans, too-
Too much... too fast...?
Y-U-H-E-E-Y-A-H.  Yu-hee-yah...? No way, busters use it in a sentence.
Why don't you let at do that...?
Stop it.
We're quite a pair, you and I.
Hello...?
Ro - you can't really believe that. Nobody can murder someone with their feelings.  I mean --- that's CRAZY.
C'mon.  Let's go to the ho---
I'll bet she had a wonderful smile.
Either do I.    I love you, Ro.  You know that. You're a total mystery to me - but I love YOU. 
I took off my gloves today - with Aaron -  - and it was okay.
Maybe the shrimp you bad last night.
It's not some fairytale in an old book.    Michael - look at me.  I didn't choose this, Michael.  This is who I am.  I love you.
You did that, didn't you...?
If it's a boy --- Taylor.
sooner Or later you're gonna run out of things to change.  You always do.
I'm getting --- left behind.
I thought it was 'whistle while you work.
That's new territory for us...but yes, we can look into that.  Explore shelter possibilities, funding bodies. we could -
Sounds good - thank you
You see, I am writing this article for CHIC MAGAZINE
All the time?
I wasn't a manager here then MRS STECKLER - don't you remember?
This must be one of the old keys -
Do you take sugar?
My names isn't ANGELA...
Sugar?
I don't know
I don't like sugar
I haven't been using it recently LESLIE
Well, what do you think?
What?
What happened?
As it happens, I was at home alone - maybe we could solve each others problems?
I genuinely think she wants me. I feel a vibe.
The only chick more untouchable than Christy Malone is Miss April.  "Hi, my name's Ginger. I love tofu burgers, rainy nights, and riding bareback.  My biggest turn-off is cell phones during sex." Here's a tip:  set it on VIBRATE, honey, and don't be stingy with the lube.  Don't knock it till you tried it.
You're late, bro!
You'll never believe who's in there.
And while you're at it, I'll take ten dozen of those puppies with the springy heads.
Never say never.
We don't generally feature blow-up dolls in our magazine. But hey, if you think there's a market for it.
Wouldn't it be awesome if we were about to say the exact same thing?
And I was wondering.
I thought I'd be nervous, but you sure know how to make a girl feel relaxed, Teddy Bear.
I have to admit, I am so totally turned on. We should do it. Now.
I mean, what do you think?
We think you should give up the magazine. Sell it. Let someone else run it. Whatever it takes.
I remember spring break of my senior year.  Seems like a lifetime ago.
You guys are my parents.
Son.
They did do one great thing. They gave us our boy.
Think of it as a rite of passage to manhood.
Whatever helps you cope.
Finally, some gratitude.
Don't worry.  He found the chocolate room.
Or do you have a taste for the good life, Ted? It's in your blood.
Teddy? I was thinking.
After graduation...maybe we could go away together?
This is humiliating. We're being ejected from a prom!
Matter of fact, Jay, my uncle and I are planning to rethink the magazine. To expand the traditional western notions of "beauty."
Sheryl Petersen is, what, nine years old, what does she know?
Impressive. This is bigger than our whole house.
They say money can't buy happiness but this is a reasonably good facsimile.
If you could just sign right there.
Let me guess: retail sales of little chocolate sprinkles have gone through the roof!
What is it, William Randolph? Your balls need scratching?
She said peanuts, you cretin.
Considering this is your first time on a private jet, on which you are interviewing the world's most eligible bachelor,  you are extremely cavalier.
I mean my father.
It's all so complicated.
And then what?
That's two words. And I'm out of the "exposed" business, remember? I need to graduate. Besides, Merk's a boy scout.
Shoes, if you want to know the truth. Shoes are my thing.
Turned out to be a scoundrel, eh? I saw that one coming.
Come on.
And I thought maybe I'd take up boating. I've always wanted to be a "coxswain."
The thing is, I'll need a first mate.
Planet Ted. Five years from now. What's happening?
You don't have to work another day in your lives.
You're free.  You can do anything you ever wanted to do!
I like you, Ted. You know that. I liked you before you were filthy rich.
What kind of sick question is that? I'll be watching you, young man. Your money and power mean nothing here. Nothing.
Honestly, Merk. It's like you were never seventeen and the head of a media empire.
Smashing!  Welcome to the family, Ted. You are going to breathe some new life into this place. You are going to set the world on fire! You are going to...call me Uncle Billy? Please?
You ready for your big coming out party? Everybody's dying to meet you.
Truth is, I'm a little nervous.
So far, so good. Some of them have real Angel potential.
I never saw anybody turn so many shades of red.
I'd love to, but I really need to crack the books.  Final exams are coming up and I've been slacking.
Thanks, Uncle Billy. Thanks for everything.
What are you doing?
How you doing, Artie?
Merritt, Forensics.
You come all the way out here to watch Walter?
No.  Not after that night.  I don't know what happened.  Maybe he caught her with some john... All I know is, the next morning the girl was gone and there was a dead boy... Indian kid named Davy.  Used to live down the road there in a wrecked car. Him and Suzie were at the Glades that night.  It was right after that, Ray got Suzie busted and sent her away.  That's what there is to say about Ray Duquette.
Wasn't enough Van Ryan had to destroy the people who invested here.  He got to be old, he and his rich cronies would come down here, hunt and whore, act like assholes.  One trip he showed up with this young girl he'd picked up somewhere, gotten her pregnant then dumped her in the swamp.  That came with her.
So Suzie and Sandra Van Ryan were half- sisters.
He said something like, "Do you want it dirty7" or something.  I tried to turn away, but he pushed me to the floor.
Yes.  I said stop.  I screamed.  I mean that's how it sounded in my head.  He hurt me...
Did you try to fight him?
Did you call anyone?  Did you call her house to see if she got home?  Did you call the Masons?
I've got that two o'clock in town.
Same as him.  They saw her come.  They saw her go.  They saw him follow.
We failed to mention the mower guy's a drunk, that he was after more beer and never really saw Kelly go into the house, so he can't say how long she was in there.  Same with the kids.  They saw her running down the street, but that's it.  With no physical evidence, what do we have?  Her word against his.
You can go up to one of those trees and peel the bark.  You know what you get? More bark.  And more bark.  There's no core.  Tree's not good tar anything but sucking up water.  And now they can't get rid of them.  They've tried poisons. Nothing works.  They don't die.
That's what they called it when I was in Juvenile.  It's a pretty dismal place.
You saw the news today?
So what about the girls?  Suzie's poor, but why would Kelly have to steal from her own mother?  Surely her father...
Where'd you come up with this stuff, anyway?
Which she might have saved, if she hadn't set out to destroy the man's life.
Two kids could've gotten into a fight, lost a couple of teeth.
He's leaving the country.  And I don't give a shit.
Yes.
At that point were you able to fight him off?
Why?
Are you crazy, Ray?
Oh, Ray... no...
And then what... he touched you?  Did you maybe flirt a little...
Suzie!  Did this man rape you?
Come on.  Beats study hall, doesn't it?
You know, I want to thank you for getting me into this class...  No way was my old man going to spring for the fees...
Way I hear it, he was pretty tight with the kids, one of the guys...
Will you calm down.  Duquette's gonna come to you just like he did to me. You're gonna have to be ready for him.
I can't believe you called Sam.  What's the matter with you?
I thought we were goin' to a movie.
Excuse me?
Get off my property.
Which one of your "bodyguards" is that?
Kelly.  What is it?
What?
We have to stick with the plan.
I'm sorry, Kelly.  I'm sorry it had to happen like this.  She was losing it...
Hello?
I'm really serious.  That cop, he keeps watching me.
But check this...
There's nothing for them to get.
I just want my life back...
Where is she?
It's Celine.  He's okay.  He had a pretty good line on what cheap fucks people are.
You ought to watch it with that shit, Suzie.  You get busted again, you go back in a two-tine loser.
Every triangle I've ever seen never lasts.  Somebody's got to go.
I had to go look for this coupon.
Fuck you.  This is bullshit.  I'm outta here.
Yeah, well, you fixed that.  What the hell happened, anyway?
Jesus, man... You okay?
But I..
That was about as grim as it gets.
What?
What?  You're going to drive off without even saying hi?
I can't, Sandy.  I've got to run.
J. S. Bach.
Valet?  You jest of course.  I am a U.S. Marshal.
Congratulations.  Unfortunately, my train is about to leave, and I really must insist you disembark.
You're quite the wordsmith, fiddle boy.  But nobody smooth-talks his way into my assignment.
But don't pull that again.
Eight scientists.  Eight different fields of endeavor.  Hydraulics, optics, ballistics...
A giant... hydraulically operated microscope... that explodes?  Or maybe just someone who hates scientists.
What was all that back there?
Uh... how long ago was this?
You might have mentioned you had that.
Strange... you'd think he'd have this place better guarded.
Can you fill me in here?
This is good.
What's this?
What is that?
And people are actually fooled by that?
When we find him, he is mine.
What if these tracks are just leading us to an Indian village or some old coot's mining claim?
Pull the balloon right in front of him!  We'll board the damn thing!
All right, all right... It'll be okay.  I mean, eventually it'll just run out of steam.
Time for you to get off, Ma'am.
Have you taken a wrong turn, Mr. Tyler?
You've... done... this... before.
Mr. President, good to see you again, sir.  Sorry about all that.
Good work.  Really.
But what would anyone have to gain from all this...?  Unless it were a foreign power.
Really?  Must be a dangerous business.
You're not that big.
The U.S. is my jurisdiction.
Easy now.
Gotta get the Doctor someplace safe.
I only met him once, but that was enough.  For such a little man he had quite an oversized opinion of himself.  He offered me the "rare and unparalleled opportunity" to develop a new steam engine for him.  He claims to have some sort of factory in Texas, I believe. Said I could have the run of the place.  He had all sorts of specifications.  But when I questioned him closely, it became obvious he was just another mercenary businessman.  Both he and his partner had no real love of steam.  It's sad.  So few men do.
Are you all right?
It's you they're after, Madmarti- gan.  What did you do this time?
Willow Ufgood.
Why can't you do it?  You have mag- ical powers.
Now, you know where you're going?  Down there, through those trees, follow the river.  You'll know the crossroads by a big daikini struc- ture.  Willow, this is serious business.  Don't waste any time, the outer world is no place for a Nelwyn.  Give the baby to the first daikini you see, then hurry home as fast as you can.
We'll probably die here, Sorsha.
Willow, why don't you use your mag- ic to get us out of here?
You all right?
Hey!  Give me that baby!
Did she ask about me?
Madmartigan!  I can't stand being in closed-in places.
Watch it!
I don't know, Willow.
It's not a Nelwyn baby.
Kill him!
We don't have much time left!  Go on!  Go on!
Your will!  Your will!  What else could it be?
Oooh, this smells terrible.
Ouch!!
What'd you bit me for!!
Again:  what is the magician's weapon?
I just wanted to test it first.
Tir Asleen.
Watch this.  Right between the eyes.
We gotta follow them.
She needs to be changed again. Sorsha crosses her arms in a hugg and watches as Willow changes the baby.  Soon the baby stops crying.  Re- lieved yet still anxious, Sorsha paces to a mirror. Willow rocks the baby gently, absently looking at the fire.  Then his eyes focus on the fire.
She's hungry.
We are emissaries of her majesty, Queen Cherlindrea, of the land of Coshairm.
She requests the presence of your- self and the young princess.
Its branches are supposed to be made of gold, solid gold.
We've traveled a long way.  We're looking for Fin Raziel.
You've got a man here and the kids are upstairs?
Good morning. Book, is it? You are the Yankee they talk about?
Eli says you're a carpenter, Book.
Nail it!
He was... like him.
Tell you what  I'm going to let you handle this one. But only if you promise not to say anything to your momma. I've got a feeling she wouldn't understand.
Is it them?
Are you really ever coming back?
Have you got your gun on now?
You're still convinced there's a link to the department?
I'm fine. I'm going to live a long time. That's what I called to tell you.
You're going to have to do it right here, Schaeffer.
It's all over, Paul.
But why?
John Book, I would appreciate it if, during the time you are with us, you would have as little to do with Samuel as possible.
I should tell you these do not have buttons.  See? Hooks and eyes.
When will you be going?
Won him over just like that.
You're so sure of that?
There is always a way! But you are such a... a Glotzkopp you cannot see! You'd rather go back to that city! To nothing! No woman! No children! No land!
What you do is take vengeance! Which is a sin against heaven!
I want you to take this... to remember by.
You'd lie to protect him.
John said you're Amish.
Just a minute. I'll pour you some coffee.
What's so funny?
Who was that man?
Eh? Nothing? Rachel, you bring this man to our house. With his gun of the hand. You bring fear to this house. Fear of English with guns coming after. You bring blood and whispers of more blood. Now English music... and you are dancing to English music! And you call this nothing?
I am not a child.
You're Rachel Lapp, aren't you?
She say where he is?
Weird, man. No fuckin' electricity. What do you figure they plug all their shit into?
He'll live.
Seventy --  Dorothy, please!
Oh, Auntie Em -- it's you!
But I did leave you, Uncle Henry -- that's just the trouble.  And I tried to get back for days and days.
Well, Dorothy was walking along the --
To see?
If she?
...have you come back?
Frightened?  You are talking to a man who has laughed in the face of death -- sneered at doom and chuckled at catastrophe.  I was petrified.  Then suddenly the wind changed, and the balloon floated down into the heart of this noble city, where I was instantly acclaimed Oz, the First Wizard de Luxe!
Oh! Oh, it feels like my joints are rusted. Listen, Dorothy, don't let Hunk kid you about Miss Gulch. She's just a poor sour-faced old maid that -- she ain't got no heart left. You know, you should have a little more heart yourself, and have pity on her.
...didn't you?
No!  No -- no!  Here -- you can have your old slippers -- but give me back Toto.
Oh, very good, but very mysterious.  He lives in the Emerald City, and that's a long journey from here. Did you bring your broomstick with you?
Well, then, you'll have to walk.  The Munchkins will see you safely to the border of Munchkinland.  And remember, never let those ruby slippers off your feet for a moment, or you will be at the mercy of the Wicked Witch of the West.
Oh, will you help me?  Can you help me?
Are you ready now?
Professor Marvel never guesses -- he knows! Now, why are you running away?
That's right.  What's she doing?
...bed.
...you don't suppose she could really be sick, do you? Oh -- Oh, I've got to go home right away!
Oh -- 
Here's what I'm taking him in -- so he can't attack me again.
Here!  I've got an order!  Let me have...
Oh! They're - they're gone now.
We might.
Tomorrow?  Oh, but I want to go home now.
Ahh --- Oh, it ticks!  Listen!
Oh, my!
Oh, my!
Yes -- let's run!
How about a hippopotamus?
Supposin' you met an elephant?
That noise don't come from no ordinary bird.
As Monarch of the Forest I don't like the situation.
Whhhooops!  Ha-ha -- there goes some of me again!
I couldn't say.  But even if he didn't, you'd be no worse off than you are now.
Oh, you're the best friends anybody ever had!  And it's funny, but I feel as if I've known you all the time.  But I couldn't have, could I?
...along.
Who killed my sister?  Who killed the Witch of the East? Was it you? Answer me!
Yeah.
Dorothy next!
Comin' to think of it, forty winks wouldn't be bad.
Here --   Come on.
Yes, you.
That's right.
Up!
Now, let' s see -- this goes -- Oh, I wish I were better at puzzles.
There. Now, that's the best we can do without any pins.
You don't get around us that easy!
...of the West.
Beautiful!  What an echo!
Come on -- come on --
Oh - oh, poor Dorothy!
Ha -- ha -- ha --
Did you hear that?  He'll announce us at once!  I've as good as got my brain!
Oh, did - did you see that?
Oh, I think I see a jijik And he's fuzzy and he's furry I haven't got a brain But I think I ought to worry!
It's a whozis.
Who do you suppose they were? And where did they take her? A fine thing - to go to pieces at a time like this!
Oh, dear, dear.
Doctor. Jones. Christmas Jones. No jokes, Ive heard them all.
What the hell are you talking about?
Whos she?
Elektra King?  Are you insane?  This is her pipeline.
Do you know what youre doing?
Then maybe Id be... open to that.
Constructions not exactly my line.
Old friend?
Sir Robert tried to deal with the kidnapping with his own...resources, at first. When Elektras ear was delivered to him in the post, he came to me.  I advised against paying the ransom. I knew it was Renard. I played it out as long as possible to get a fix on him.
Now Robert is dead. He got his revenge.
Get out to the pipeline. Find the insider who switched the pin. If your instincts are right, Renard will be back. He hasnt completed the job. The pipeline is still going forward, and we have Elektra to thank for that.
Not the usual Swiss procedure, Mr. Bond, but you understand, a man in my position..
I am just a middle man. I am doing the honourable thing and returning the money to its rightful owner...
Who is it?
Today, of all days, the sun decides to shine.
I met you at my fathers funeral.
I have to check the upper lines.  Gabor will drive you back.
I cant stay.
James...
Then take me with you.
If this little show is for my benefit, Ill take you home right now.
You knew when you first saw me.  You knew it would be like this.
How did you survive?
Are you saying...Renard is the man whos trying to kill me?
How dare you!  How dare you! That animal!?  That monster!? He disgusts me! You disgust me!  So he knew where to hurt you, is that it? You had a sling on your arm at the funeral! I didnt have to sleep with you to find that out.
Valentin Zukovsky.
You, of course. I need some information.
What are doing, Bond?  Trying to impress this innocent thing?
Mother of God.
In the good old days, the KGB had three or four spots where our submarines could surface without anyone knowing. But Yevgeny is supposed to be loading cargo.
Ill send someone out.
Your people? Your people will leave you here to rot just like you left me. You and my father. He didnt think my life was worth the chump change he spent on a day at the stock market.
Why are you like this?  Because Bond is dead?  Its what you wanted.
He was a...good lover?
This is the end.
Weve been pawns in someones game. They tricked us into bringing the money to King. Not just elaborate.  Cock-sure.
Why?  What's the problem?
As you can see, we may be able to salvage a good-sized chunk of the farm belt.
We don't really know, sir, but bluntly, our survival capability . . . may depend on a quirk of the weather.
Had a lot of blood in him.
That man, then, he was the first.  The first you --
Would you like me to stay?
In the immediate future we're on Mars.  I'm telling you goodbye. You're trying to convince me to cure your illness . . .
This whole place is ticking.  Does it -- keep time?
Jon, does anybody know what the hell you're talking about?  Dan's just an ordinary guy, but he talks to me.  When he looks at me he's seeing something more than just a -- a collection of atoms.
Then why don't you . . . do something about it!
Because you can't, I know, it's preordained.  So sorry.  I forgot.  Jon.  This, this "script" you're following . . . who writes it?
Oh God.  I'm no more than a bug on a windshield to you.
The Comedian.  He's dead.  Murdered.  That's all I know.
No.  I just wanted you to --
It is  Jon.  Twenty-four years ago.  Before he turned into Dr. Manhattan.
It's a tachyon chamber.  It generates subatomic particles which flow backward in time.  There are other worlds, Daniel, other timelines -- existing parallel to our own --
Dont be obtuse, Daniel.  If I kill Jon in the past, none of this will happen.  We wont even be here, will we?
Hey.  You remember that nut in the hockey mask?  With the asthma? What was his name . . .
No wonder Adrian's rich.  You use that stuff?
The Owlship.  I can't believe it.
I took her out a couple of summers back.  Scared the hell out of some cows.  -- I wonder if she'd make it down to Antarctica.
What's he doing?
I beg your pardon . . . ?  Some gratitude.
Dan, is this -- is this New York??
Dan -- what do we do now?
Hiya, pardner.  Long time no see.
. . . That was quick.
Obvious pattern -- all ties in --
How do we know they've got cancer?  Could be part of massive propaganda scheme . . .
We're running, Rorschach.  We've got no place to go.  We're hightailing it down to Adrian's.
. . . And they call me a fucking nut.
Nothing wrong with ketchup.
Anything for science, I guess.  Janey, there's something --
Stupid watch.  Stopped again.  Do you have the --
No comment.
Their real names, please.
Sit down, Miss Juspeczyk.  As I mentioned, the people in this file are all close associates of Dr. Manhattan.  They have something else in common as well.  They've all developed a fairly . . . exotic form of lymphatic cancer.
I'm terribly sorry.
Six to eight months.  That's with treatment.  -- Perhaps now you can see why it's so vital that we locate your . . . friends.
He's a little farther gone every time.
Terrorist.  Radical agitator.  Stool pigeon.
Call off the cat and I'll kill you, Veidt.
Why is that?
Oh I don't know, I think the tests work pretty well. Sometimes they give me answers you wouldn't admit to in a million years.
You've really got me confused, Cage. On the one hand you showed leadership, courage under fire, a willingness to protect men you hardly knew... and on the other you have an arrest record that pegs you as near sociopathic. Help me out here. I'm not following your evolution.
How about a pedicure as long as you're down there. What's this? Lo-Jack?
I guess you got my E-mail. I set up a purchase. Ten cars.
They retrofitted Ahab with some kind of rocket launcher. They were loading canisters of liquid into it, light colored and dark colored in the same tube but separate. Something tells me this it that "classified" stuff you didn't want me to know about. Does the song "Silent Night" mean anything to you?
Thought you bought the farm down there, X. Glad as hell to see you.
On come on, X. Did you really think we were that barbaric?
Silent Night in the hands of a bunch of impertinent cowboys
They're degenerates. There's not a man in there that would give a damn if the Chinese took over.
You what? A wire transfer of this size?
What are you gonna do? They're Euro- trash.
Nothing, really. My guy is just doing it to stay alive.
Where are you going?
I was invited. What's your story?
Who are you?
That's alright, I'll figure something out.
So what's the plan with this Ahab? Are they selling it or what?
We've got to find out what it is. Can you handle that?
You're what? What the hell have you been doing?
We can't leave now. We have to do something.
Yes, I do. You're right. I can't just let him go free. Besides, I can help you from the inside.
What are you doing?
You've been so quiet lately, Petra, I thought you no longer cared.
Now that I've given you the overview, we're going to spend the next couple hours going into extensive operational detail.
I can see that. Why?
I found something big enough for us to take these guys down with. They've got a of nerve agent they're gonna unleash.
Heads up, man. What's this thing on my back?
That's the guy.
Cops. Like a plague. No matter how many you pay there's always another with his hand out. How did you pick him out?
It's all this craziness! It's what we've been living since 99, when we left the Army. One of our brothers died in Grozny and we said the hell with this shit. What for? He dies for what? Politics? Who's politics? Not ours.
Yes -- Only there's a problem.  The mutator gene is not responding to the radiation the way it would in mother nature.  It's forcing the body's cells to replicate thousands of times faster than they're accustomed to.  The Senator's body is literally burning itself out.  Scott -- this machine kills people and I don't think Magneto realizes it.
I'll tell you one thing though.
I'm going to assume that means that the Secret Service is out of commission.  Jean, can you raise me up there?
I've served with men like you before. Methodical.  Systematic -- Naive.  You know what happens to those men in a real fight?
I'm o.k.  I'm o.k.
I'll see what I can do -- You should get some sleep.  Even with your healing ability, you're going to be hurting for a while.
If necessary.
Let go.
Ms. Grey -- you work at a school for mutants in Westchester, New York.  Can you tell the members of this committee what exactly you are teaching these mutants?
You wouldn't happen to be teaching them how to use their powers to --
Dr. Grey.
The mutant gene tells the body when it needs to change.
I do love a good check mate.
Don't you knock?
Is that what you're looking for?
I am trying to save our kind, Charles. You should do the same.
Is that so?
Oh, shit.
I think we all need a good night's sleep.  Why don't we meet next week and thrash this thing out?
Give him an extra dollar.
Carlson!
Herr Falkstein!  Did you inform Frederick Frankenstein of this assembly and all the particulars of the time and place?
But I received a cable only this morning, saying that he could not come.
MMMmm!
Surprised?
Miss me?
Darling!...you will be careful!?
Promise??
I hope you like large weddings.
Are you suggesting I call him master???
Is your room just down the hall? ... in case I get frightened during the night?
You'll fine the keys to all the rooms in my cas... all the rooms in your castle on this ring.  I'll leave it on the table here.
Dr. Frankenstein?
What?
I didn't do that.
All right then, I suppose I owe the family that much.  You'll have everything ready for me when I arrive?
Isn't it true that Darwin preserved a piece of vermicelli in a glass case until, by some extraordinary means, it actually began to move with voluntary motion?
Vermicelli.
Nineteen, sir.
And do you also say Fro dereck?
Why isn't it Frodereck Fronkon steen?
I see.
Well, they were wrong then, weren't they?
There.
What are you doing here?
It seems that way.  You didn't hear any music at all?
Did you see anyone else down here?
It is!  This was my grandfather's private library.  Look at this!
What a filthy job!
Very little decay.  With this magnificent specimen for a body, all we need now is an equally magnificent brain.  You know what to do!
I'm getting excited just thinking about it.  What if he's not there?
It's always been one of my favorite names.
You're sure you know what you're doing?
But you did -- I just heard it.
Better not get too close, master. This guy could kill you.
Repeat it anyway -- it's a wonderful cue.
Thanks...for all your help.
I'm a failure.
No!  The only hope now is to get him back here.  If I can just find a way to relieve the pressure on his cerebellum...
It's alive.  It's -- moving! It's -- breathing!  It's -- standing!  What is your name?
What's that tune that you're playing
May I see your violin?
Inga!
Listen!  Don't you hear that strange music?
Let me come with you, Doctor, please!  I don't want to stay up here alone.
Look, Doctor!
Oh, doctor!
Soon, all the electrical secrets of Heaven shall be mine.
A god?
Reputation.  Reputation!
Yes, I know.
Look how far we've come.
Three minutes to go!
Yes, sir, name, please?
GRRRHMMNNNJKJMMMNN!

You intended to bring your reserves across the river?
Tomorrow we will continue our advance on Ulundi. Dumford, kindly return to your unit Bring them here immediately to support Pulleine. Mr Vereker will join you as ADC. Do you understand me clearly?
Yes. I see you've issued each of them with a Martini Henry Carbine. Our quota for Native contingencies: one rifle to ten men and only five rounds per rifle.
Yes?
Lighting COGHILL' 5 cigar: Our good Colonel Dumford scored quite a coup with the Sikali Horse.
Choose your targets men. That's right Watch those markers. 55
Lord Chelmsford seems to want me to stay back with my Basutos.
